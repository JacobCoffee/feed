            >

        </div>

        <!-- Content Section -->
        <div class="p-4 flex-grow overflow-hidden">
          <p class="text-base-content">
            <p>It has been a few months since I wrote about <a class="reference external" href="https://rye.astral.sh/">Rye</a> here last.  You might remember that in
February I passed over stewardship of my Rye packaging too to <a class="reference external" href="https://astral.sh/">Astral</a>.  The folks over there have been super busy in
building a lot of amazing tooling for Python packaging in the last few
months.  If you have been using Rye in the last few months you will have
noticed that the underlying resolver and installer <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/">uv</a> got a lot better and faster.</p>
<p>As of the most recent release, <cite>uv</cite> also gained a lot of functionality that
previously required Rye such as manipulating <cite>pyproject.toml</cite> files,
workspace support, local package references and script installation.  It
now also can manage Python installations for you so it's getting much
closer.</p>
<p>If you are using Rye today, consider this blog post as a reminder that you
should probably starting having a closer look at <cite>uv</cite> and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/astral-sh/rye/discussions/1342">give feedback to
the Astral folks</a>.</p>
<p>I gave a talk just recently in Prague at EuroPython about my current view
of the Python packaging, the lessons I learned when creating Rye and one
of the things I mentioned there is that the goal of a packaging tool has
to be that it will dominate the space.  The tool that absolutely everybody
uses has to be the best tool: it's the thing any new person to Python gets
to see when they start their programming journey.  After that talk a lot
of people walked up to me and had a lot of questions about that in
particular.</p>
<p>Python in the last two years has become an incredibly hot and popular
platform for many new developers.  That has in part been fueled by all the
investments and interest that went into AI and ML.  I really want
everybody who gets to learn and experience Python not to remember it as an
old language with bad tooling, but as an amazing language with a stellar
developer experience.  Unfortunately that's not the case today because
there is so much choice, so many tools that are not quite compatible, and
by the inconsistency everywhere.  I have seen people walk down one tool,
just to re-emerge moving their entire stack to conda and back because they
hit some wall.</p>
<p>Domination is a goal because it means that most investment will go into
one stack.  I can only re-iterate my wish and desire that Rye (and with it
a lot of other tools in the space) should cease to exist once the
dominating tool has been established.  For me <cite>uv</cite> is poised to be that
tool.  It's not quite there today yet for all cases, but it will be in no
time, and now is the moment to step up as a community and start to start
to rally around it.  That doesn't mean that this tool will be the tool
forever.  Things come and go and maybe there is a future for some other
tool.</p>
<p>But today I'm looking forward to the moment when there will be a final
release of Rye that is no remaining functionality other than to just
largely alias to uv, that retires Rye specific functionality and migrates
you over to uv.</p>
<p>However I <em>only have the power to retire one tool, and that won't be
enough</em>.  Today we are using so many other package managing solutions for
Python and we should be advertising fewer.  I understand how much time and
effort went into many of those, and everybody's contributions are
absolutely appreciated.  Software like Rye and uv were built on the
advancements of the ecosystem underneath it.  They leverage years and
years of work that went into migrating the Python ecosystems from setup.py
files to eggs and finally wheels.  From not having a metadata standard to
having one.  From coupled to decoupled build systems.  Much of what makes
Rye so enjoyable were individuals that worked towards making
redistributable and downloadable Python binaries a possibility.  There was
a lot of work that was put into building out an amazing ecosystem of Rust
crates and Python libraries needed to make these tools work.  All of that
brought us to that point where we are today.</p>
<p>But it is my believe that we need to take the next step and be willing to
say as a community that some tools are no longer recommended.  Maybe not
today, but that moment will come quicker than we think.  I remember a time
when many of us who maintained Python libraries pointed new developers to
using <cite>ez_setup.py</cite> and <cite>easy_install</cite> in our onboarding guides.  Years
later we removed the mentions of <cite>ez_setup.py</cite> from our guides to replace
them with <cite>pip</cite>.  Some of us have pointed developers at <cite>pip-tools</cite>, at
<cite>poetry</cite> or <cite>PDM</cite>.  Many projects today even show 5 different installation
guides because of that wild variety of tools available because they no
longer feel like they can recommend one.</p>
<p>If you maintain an important Python project I would ask you to give <cite>uv</cite> a
try and ask yourself if you would consider pointing people towards it.  I
think that this is our best shot in the community at finding ourselves in
a much better position than we have ever been.</p>
<p>Have a look at the blog post that Charlie from Astral wrote about what <a class="reference external" href="https://astral.sh/blog/uv-unified-python-packaging">uv
can do today</a>.
It's a true accomplishment worth celebrating and enjoying.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<small><p><strong>Postscriptum:</strong> there is an elephant in the room which is that Astral is a
VC funded company.  What does that mean for the future of these tools?
Here is my take on this: for the community having someone pour money into
it can create some challenges.  For the PSF and the core Python project
this is something that should be considered.  However having seen the code
and what uv is doing, even in the worst possible future this is a very
forkable and maintainable thing.  I believe that even in case Astral shuts
down or were to do something incredibly dodgy licensing wise, the
community would be better off than before uv existed.</p>

            <p>Ever wished you could take an <strong>Intro to Python training</strong> with me, but you don&rsquo;t work for a company with a generous training budget?
I&rsquo;m running a Python-learning program just for this situation.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/high-five/">Python High Five</a> is a 10-week Python jumpstart program that starts <strong>this September</strong>.</p>

<h2>Set aside the time to learn ⌚</h2>

<p>One of the biggest problems for folks starting to learn Python is <strong>setting aside the time</strong>.
And even if you <em>do</em> manage to set aside the time, you&rsquo;ll often hit a roadblock where you feel <strong>confused</strong>.</p>

<p>Python High Five is a way to keep a <strong>daily learning habit</strong> <em>and</em> to <strong>get help</strong> when find yourself stuck.</p>

<p>This program is based around <strong>daily practice</strong>.
Monday through Friday you&rsquo;ll pick <strong>30 minutes</strong> from your schedule, at any time that works you.
During those 30 minutes, you&rsquo;ll watch a 5 minute video, work on the day&rsquo;s exercise, and reflect on your progress.</p>

<h2>The most effective learning is hands-on 🖐️</h2>

<p>Python High Five is all about learning through <strong>writing Python code</strong>.
Each week we&rsquo;ll dive deeper into Python, building upon what we&rsquo;ve learned so far.</p>

<p>When you find yourself stuck you can get help through an asynchronous <strong>group chat</strong> and weekly <strong>office hour</strong> sessions.
In addition to our weekly office hours together, I&rsquo;ll check the chat each day, respond to questions, and provide guidance.</p>

<h2>Proven learning techniques behind the scenes 📝</h2>

<p>The daily check-ins allow for daily <strong>accountability</strong>.
The group chat also provides both a community of peers to rely on, and <strong>guidance from an experienced Python trainer</strong> (me).</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll also be using proven learning techniques behind the scenes:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Retrieval practice</strong>: you don&rsquo;t learn by putting information into your head, but by trying to take it out; for Python learning, that means writing code.</li>
<li><strong>Spaced repetition</strong>: cramming is less effective than learning spaced out over time, which is why we&rsquo;ll spend 30 minutes each weekday instead of spending a few hours every week.</li>
<li><strong>Interleaving</strong>: each day&rsquo;s exercise isn&rsquo;t predictably themed because a bit of unpredictability can be <em>really</em> improve learning outcomes.</li>
<li><strong>Elaboration</strong>: your daily check-in isn&rsquo;t <em>just</em> about reflection: it&rsquo;s also a helpful learning tool!</li>
</ul>


<p>Plus, we&rsquo;ll be working through curriculum I&rsquo;ve been developing and iterating on for many years.
I have taught these topics in many different settings to folks from <em>many</em> different backgrounds.</p>

<h2>Form a daily learning habit 🔁</h2>

<p>Any 10-week program will be <em>just the start</em> of a Python learning habit.
You&rsquo;ll need to keep up your Python after Python High Five ends, either by promptly applying your skills to a new project or diving deeper into Python with continued daily practice.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m offering an <strong>80% discount</strong> for High Five attendees on one year of <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com">Python Morsels</a>, which is my skill-building service designed to help <strong>deepen your Python skills every week</strong>.

        <p>One way to check whether a list is empty is to <strong>check the length</strong> of that list.
If the length is <code>0</code>, the list <em>must</em> be empty:</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">numbers</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[]</span>

        <p>Or if we wanted to check for <strong>non-empty lists</strong>, we could make sure that the length is <em>greater</em> than <code>0</code>:</p>

            Python performance has come a long way in recent times. And it's often the data scientists, with their computational algorithms and large quantities of data, who care the most about this form of performance. It's great to have Stan Seibert back on the show to talk about Python's performance for data scientists. We cover a wide range of tools and techniques that will be valuable for many Python developers and data scientists.

        <div class="p-4 flex-grow overflow-hidden">

            <p>So a common theme on the Internet about Debian is <a href="https://workaround.org/debian-packages-are-so-old/">so old</a>. And
right, I am getting close to the stage that I feel a little laggy: I
am using a bunch of backports for packages I need, and I'm missing a
bunch of <em>other</em> packages that just landed in unstable and didn't make
it to backports for various reasons.</p>

<p>I disagree that "old" is a bad thing: we definitely run Debian stable
on a fleet of about 100 servers and can barely keep up, I would make
it <em>older</em>. And "old" is a good thing: (port) wine and (any) beer
needs time to age properly, and so do humans, although some humans
never seem to grow old enough to find wisdom.</p>

<p>But at this point, on my laptop, I am feeling like I'm <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out">missing
out</a>. This page, therefore, is an evolving document that is a twist
on the classic <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/NewIn">NewIn</a> game. Last time I played seems to be
<a href="https://anarc.at/blog/2013-05-01-new-debian-release-my-contributions-newinwheezy-game/">#newinwheezy</a>
(2013!), so really, I'm due for an update. (To be fair to myself, I do
keep tabs on upgrades quite well at <a href="https://anarc.at/services/upgrades/">home</a> and
<a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/tpa/team/-/wikis/howto/upgrades">work</a>, which do have their share of "new in", just after the fact.)</p>

<h1 id="new-packages-to-explore">New packages to explore</h1>

<p>Those tools are shiny new things available in unstable or perhaps
Trixie (testing) already that I am not using yet, but I find
interesting enough to list here.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://code.google.com/p/codesearch/">codesearch</a>: search all of Debian's source code (tens of
thousands of packages) from the commandline! (see also <a href="https://github.com/jwilk/dcs-cli">dcs-cli</a>,
not in Debian)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/tomwright/dasel">dasel</a>: JSON/YML/XML/CSV parser, similar to jq, but different
syntax, not sure I'd grow into it, but often need to parse YML like
JSON and failing</li>
<li><a href="https://codeberg.org/dnkl/fyi">fyi</a>: notify-send replacement</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ingydotnet/git-subrepo">git-subrepo</a>: git-submodule replacement I am considering</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jovanlanik/gtklock">gtklock</a>: swaylock replacement with bells and whistles,
particularly interested in showing time, battery and so on</li>
<li><a href="https://hyprland.org">hyprland</a>: possible Sway replacement, but there are <a href="https://drewdevault.com/2023/09/17/Hyprland-toxicity.html">rumors of a
toxic community</a> (<a href="https://blog.vaxry.net/articles/2023-hyprlandsCommunity">rebuttal</a>, I haven't reviewed either in
detail), so approach carefully)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/">ruff</a>: faster Python formatter and linter, flake8/black/isort
replacement, alas not mypy/LSP unfortunately, designed to be ran
<em>alongside</em> such a tool, which is <a href="https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot/discussions/1429#discussioncomment-10149990">not possible in Emacs eglot right
now</a>, but <a href="https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode/pull/469">is possible in lsp-mode</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/LBCrion/sfwbar">sfwbar</a>: pretty status bar, may replace waybar, which i am
somewhat unhappy with (my UTC clock disappears randomly)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/spytrap-org/spytrap-adb">spytrap-adb</a>: cool spy gear</li>
</ul>


<h1 id="new-packages-i-wont-use">New packages I won't use</h1>

<p>Those are packages that I <em>have</em> tested because I found them
interesting, but ended up not using, but I think people could find
interesting anyways.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ravachol/kew">kew</a>: surprisingly fast music player, parsed my entire library
(which is huge) instantaneously and just started playing (I still
use <a href="https://github.com/dweymouth/supersonic/">Supersonic</a>, for which I maintain a <a href="https://github.com/flathub/io.github.dweymouth.supersonic">flatpak</a> on my
<a href="https://www.navidrome.org/">Navidrome</a> server)</li>
<li><a href="https://tracker.debian.org/mdformat">mdformat</a>: good markdown formatter, think <code>black</code> or <code>gofmt</code> but
for markdown), but it <a href="https://github.com/executablebooks/mdformat/issues/420">didn't actually do what I needed</a>, and
it's not quite as opinionated as it should (or could) be)</li>
</ul>


<h1 id="backports-already-in-use">Backports already in use</h1>

<p>Those are packages I already use regularly, which have backports or
that can just be installed from unstable:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nitefood/asn/">asn</a>: IP address forensics</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/markdownlint/markdownlint">markdownlint</a>: markdown linter, I use that <em>a lot</em></li>
<li><a href="https://sr.ht/~kennylevinsen/poweralertd">poweralertd</a>: pops up "your battery is almost empty" messages</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ErikReider/SwayNotificationCenter">sway-notification-center</a>: used as part of my status bar, yet another status bar
basically, a little noisy, stuck in a libc dep update</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bensadeh/tailspin">tailspin</a>: used to color logs</li>
</ul>


<h1 id="out-of-date-packages">Out of date packages</h1>

<p>Those are packages that <em>are</em> in Debian stable (Bookworm) already, but
that are somewhat lacking and could benefit from an upgrade.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/firmware/linux-firmware.git">firmware-iwlwifi</a>: out of date, can install from unstable</li>
<li><a href="https://codeberg.org/dnkl/fuzzel">fuzzel</a> / <a href="https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot">foot</a>: log level noises <a href="https://codeberg.org/dnkl/fuzzel/pulls/266">A</a>, <a href="https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot/pulls/1215">B</a>, fuzzel <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1078784">fix
not in debian yet</a>, and if we get to 1.11, my <a href="https://gitlab.com/anarcat/scripts/">scripts</a> in <code>~/bin</code>
should be patched to use <code>--cache</code></li>
<li>nomacs: non-trivial backport, out of date version in sid</li>
<li><a href="https://pandoc.org/">pandoc</a>: <a href="https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases/tag/3.0">3.0</a> is ridiculously huge, but particularly <a href="https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/issues/7172">remove
spaces after list marker</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/containers/podman">podman</a>: <a href="https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/quadlet-podman">better systemd integration</a></li>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.com/anarcat/pubpaste/">pubpaste</a>: out of date, can install from unstable</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/equeim/tremotesf2">tremotesf</a>: out of date backport</li>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.com/anarcat/undertime">undertime</a>: out of date, can install from unstable</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp">yt-dlp</a>: out of date, can install from unstable</li>
</ul>


<h1 id="last-words">Last words</h1>

<p>If you know of cool things I'm missing out of, then by all means let
me know!</p>

<p>That said, overall, this is a pretty short list! I have most of what I
need in stable right now, and if I wasn't a Debian developer, I don't
think I'd be doing the jump now. But considering how easier it is to
develop Debian (and how important it is to test the next release!),
I'll probably upgrade soon.</p>

<p>Previously, I was running Debian testing (which why the slug on that
article is <code>why-trixie</code>), but now I'm actually considering just
running unstable on my laptop directly anyways. It's been a long time
since we had any significant instability there, and I can typically
deal with whatever happens, except maybe when I'm traveling, and then
it's easy to prepare for that (just pin testing).</p>

            Is your data locked up in portable document format (PDFs)? In this talk we&rsquo;re going to explore methods to extract text and other data from PDFs using readily-available, open-source Python tools (such as pypdf), as well as techniques such as OCR (optical character recognition) and table extraction. We will also discuss the philosophy of text extraction as a whole.

            In this tutorial, you'll learn about assignment expressions and the walrus operator. The biggest change back in Python 3.8 was the inclusion of the := operator, which you can use to assign variables in the middle of expressions. You'll see several examples of how to take advantage of this feature.
