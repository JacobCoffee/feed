        <div class="p-4 flex-grow overflow-hidden">
          <p class="text-base-content">
            <p>I wrote in the past about how I'm a <a class="reference external" href="http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2023/3/20/lessons-from-a-pessimist/">pessimist that strives for positive
outcomes</a>.  One of the things
that I gradually learned is is wishing others to succeed.  That is
something that took me a long time to learn.  I did not see the value in
positive towards other people's success, but there is.  There is one thing
to be sceptical to a project or initiative, but you can still encourage
the other person and wish them well.</p>
<p>I think not wishing others well is a coping mechanism of sorts.  For sure
it was for me.  As you become more successful in life, it becomes easier
to be supportive, because you have established yourself in one way or
another and you feel more secure about yourself.</p>
<p>That said, there is something I continue to struggle with, and that are
morals.  What if the thing the other person is doing seems morally wrong
to me?  I believe that much of this struggle stems from the fear of
feeling complicit in another's choices.  Supporting someone — even
passively — can feel like tacit approval, and that can be unsettling.
Perhaps encouragement doesn't need to imply agreement.  Another angle to
consider is that my discomfort may actually stem from my own insecurities
and doubts.  When someone's path contradicts my values, it can make me
question my own choices.  This reaction often makes it hard to wish them
well, even when deep down I want to.</p>
<p>What if my tribe is just wrong on something?  I grew up with the idea of
“<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Never_again">never again</a>”.  Anything
that remotely looks like fascism really triggers me.  There is a well
known propaganda film from the US Army called “<a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGAqYNFQdZ4">Don't Be a Sucker</a>” which warns Americans
about the dangers of prejudice, discrimination, and fascist rhetoric.  I
watched this a few times over the years and it still makes me wonder how
people can fall for that kind of rhetoric.</p>
<p>But is it really all that hard?  Isn't that happening today again?  I have
a very hard time supporting what Trump or Musk are standing for or people
that align with them.  Trump's rhetoric and plans are counter to
everything I stand for and the remind me a lot of that film.  It's even
harder for me with Musk.  His morals are completely off, he seems to a
person I would not want to be friends with, yet he's successful and he's
pushing humanity forward.</p>
<p>It's challenging to reconcile my strong opposition to their (and other's)
rhetoric and policies with the need to maintain a nuanced view of them.
Neither are “literal Hitler”.  Equating them with the most extreme
historical figures oversimplifies the situation and shuts down productive
conversation.</p>
<p>Particularly watching comedy shows reducing Trump to a caricature feels
wrong to me.  Plenty of his supporters have genuine concerns.  I find it
very hard to engage with these complexities and it's deeply
uncomfortable and quite frankly exhausting.</p>
<p>Life becomes simpler when you just pick a side, but it will strip away the
deeper understanding and nuance I want to hold onto.  I don’t want to fall
into the trap of justifying or defending behaviors I fundamentally
disagree with, nor do I want to completely shut out the perspectives of
those who support him.  This means accepting that people I engage with,
might see things very differently, and that maintaining those
relationships and wishing them well them requires a level of tolerance I'm
not sure I possess yet.</p>
<p>The reason it's particularly hard to me that even if I accept that my
tribe maybe wrong in parts, I can see the effects that Trump and others
already had on individuals.  Think of the Muslim travel ban which kept
families apart for years, his border family separation policy, the
attempted repeal of Section 230.  Some of it was not him, but people he
aligned with.  Things like the overturning of Roe v. Wade and the effects
it had on women, the book bans in Florida, etc.  Yes, not quite Hitler,
but still deeply problematic for personal freedoms.  So I can't ignore the
harm that some of these policies have caused in the past and even if I
take the most favorable view of him, I have that track record to hold
against him.</p>
<p>In the end where does that leave me?  Listening, understanding, and
standing firm in my values.  But <a class="reference external" href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/11/i_wonder">not kissing the ring</a>.  And probably coping by
writing more.</p>

            <p>Building on <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/11/psf-grants-program-updates-part1.html" target="_blank">Part 1</a> of this PSF Grants Program Update, we are pleased to share updates to the Grants Workgroup (workgroup) Charter. We have outlined all the changes below in a chart, but there are a couple of changes that we’d like to highlight to grant applicants. These updates in particular will change how and when you apply, and hopefully reduce blockers to getting those applications in and ready for review. Because we are just sharing these updates, we are happy to be flexible on these changes but hope to see all applicants adhere to the changes starting around January 2025.&nbsp;</p><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li><b>Increase overall process time frame to 8 weeks (formerly 6 weeks).</b> We want to be realistic about how long the process takes and we know that going over our projection can cause pain for applicants. We hope to turn around applications in 6 weeks in most cases, but planning for the extra two weeks can make a big difference for everyone involved! </li><ul><li>Our application form requires that you set the event date out to 6 weeks in advance. We will wait to update that to 8 weeks in advance until January 2025. </li><li><i>It’s important to note that this time frame begins <b>only once all required information has been received</b>, not exactly from the day the application is submitted. Make sure to check the email you provided on the application to see if the workgroup Chair has any questions regarding your request!</i></li></ul><li><b>Add a statement of support for accessibility services.</b> In line with the PSF’s mission to support and facilitate the growth of a diverse community, we are explicitly stating in the charter that we will consider funding accessibility services. For established events (have 2 or more events in the past with more than 200 participants at the last event), we are open to considering accessibility-related requests such as live captioning, sign language interpretation, or certified child care.</li><ul><li>To review these types of requests, we will need sufficient documentation such as quotes, certifications, or any other relevant information.</li></ul><li><b>Add guidelines around program/schedule review.</b> Previously undocumented, we were checking event programs/schedules to ensure a Python focus as well as a diversity of speakers. Because of event organizing time frames, we often received grant requests before the schedule was available. Moving forward we are accepting 1 of 3 options:</li><ol><li>The program/schedule for the event</li><li>A tentative schedule or list of accepted speakers/sessions for the event</li><li>Programs from previous editions of the event if available, a link to the event’s call for proposals, which should state a required Python focus for the event as well as a statement in support of a diverse speaker group, and a description of the efforts that are being made to ensure a diversity of speakers.</li></ol></ul><h3 style="text-align: left;">Grants Workgroup Charter Updates&nbsp;</h3><h3 style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</h3>

            <p>Time has flown by since we received the <a href="https://pythonafrica.blogspot.com/2023/12/an-open-letter-to-python-software_5.html" target="_blank">community call</a> last December for greater transparency and better processes around our Grants Program. PSF staff have produced a Grants Program Transparency Report and begun holding monthly <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/02/introducing-psf-grants-office-hours.html" target="_blank">Grants Program Office Hours</a>. The PSF Board also invested in a <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/03/djangocon-africa-grant-process.html" target="_blank">third-party retrospective</a> and <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/07/psf-board-update-on-improvements-to-psf.html" target="_blank">launched a major refresh of all areas of our Grants program</a>. <br /><br />To provide the Grants Program more support, we assigned Marie Nordin, PSF Community Communications Manager, to support the Grants Program alongside Laura Graves, Senior Accountant. Marie has stepped into the Grants Workgroup Chair role to relieve Laura after 3+ years– thank you, Laura! Marie has been leading the initiatives and work related to the Grants Program in collaboration with Laura.<br /><br />Behind the scenes, PSF staff has been working with the PSF Board and the Grants Workgroup (workgroup) to translate the feedback we’ve received and the analysis we’ve performed into action, starting with the <a href="https://wiki.python.org/psf/GrantsWG/Charter">Grants Workgroup Charter</a>. A full breakdown of updates to the charter can be found in <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/11/psf-grants-program-updates-part2.html" target="_blank">Part 2</a> of this update. <br /><br />The PSF Board spent time on their recent retreat to explore priorities for the program going forward. We also ran a more thorough workgroup membership renewal process based on the updated charter to support quicker grant reviews and votes through active workgroup engagement. We’re excited to share refresh progress, updates, and plans for the future of the program later on in this post!</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Something wonderful, bringing more changes</h3><p>Meanwhile, the attention our Grants Program has received in the past year has resulted in something wonderful: we’re getting more requests than ever. Our call to historically underrepresented regions to request funds has been answered in some areas- and we are thrilled! For example, in the African region, we granted around 65K in 2023 and over 140K already this year! And, year to date in 2024 we have awarded more grant funding than we did in all of 2023. The other side of this coin presents us with a new issue– the budget for the program. <br /><br />Up until this year, we’ve been able to grant at least partial funding to the majority of requests we’ve received while staying within our guidelines and maintaining a feasible annual budget. With more eligible requests incoming, every “yes” brings us closer to the ceiling of our grant budget. In addition to the increased quantity of requests, we are receiving requests for higher amounts. Inflation and the tech crunch have been hitting event organizers everywhere (this includes the PSF-produced PyCon US), and we are seeing that reflected in the number and size of the grant requests we are receiving. <br /><br />Moving forward, with the increased quantity and amount of eligible grant requests, we will need to take steps to ensure we are balancing grant awards with sustainability for our Grants Program, and the Foundation overall. <b><i>We know that the most important part of any changes to the Grants Program is awareness and two-way communications with the community. </i></b>We aim to do that as early and transparently as we possibly can. That means we aren’t changing anything about how we award grants today or even next week– but within the next couple of months. Please keep an eye on our blog and social accounts (<a href="https://fosstodon.org/@ThePSF" target="_blank">Mastodon</a>, <a href="https://x.com/ThePSF" target="_blank">X</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/thepsf/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>) for news about upcoming changes, and make sure to share this post with your fellow Python event and initiative organizers. <br /></p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Grants Workgroup Charter update process</h3><p>The purpose of the PSF Grants Workgroup (workgroup) is to review, approve, and deny grant funding proposals for Python conferences, training workshops, Meetups, development projects, and other related Python initiatives. The workgroup charter outlines processes, guidelines, and membership requirements for the workgroup. Small changes have been made to the charter over the years, but it’s been some time since any significant changes were implemented. <br />&nbsp;<br />During the summer of 2024, Marie, workgroup chair (hi 👋 it’s me writing this!), and Laura worked on updates for the charter. The updates focused on how to make the Grants Program processes and guidelines work better for the workgroup, the PSF Board, and most especially, the community we serve. <br /><br />After many hours of discussing pain points, running scenarios, exploring possible guidelines, and drafting the actual wording, Marie and Laura introduced proposed updates for the charter to the Board in July. After a month of review and 1:1 meetings with the PSF Board and workgroup members, the updated charter went to a vote with the PSF Board on August 14th and was approved unanimously. <br /><br />The workgroup has been operating under its new charter for a couple of months. Before we shared broadly with the community, we wanted to make sure the updates didn’t cause unintended consequences, and we were ready to walk back anything that didn’t make sense. Turns out, our hard work paid off, and the updates have been mostly working as we hoped. We will continue to monitor the impact of the changes and make any adjustments in the next Charter update.

            Right now, I am on a never ending quest that requires me to think of building a full fledge MVC controller : an anti-jira tracker that would favours HARD CHECKED facts over wishful thinking.<br /><br />
For this to begin, I am not really motivated in beginning with a full fledged MVC (Model View Controller) à la django because there is a lot of boilerplates and actions to do before a result. But, it has a lot of feature I want, including authentication, authorization and handling security.<br /><br />
For prototypes we normally flavours lightweight framework (à la flask), and CRUD.<br /><br />
CRUD approach is a factorisation of all framework in a single dynamic form that adapts itself to the model to generate HTML forms to input data, tabulate, REST endpoints and search them from the python class declaration and generate the database model. One language to rule them all : PYTHON. You can easily generate even the javascript to handle autocompletion on the generated view from python with enough talent.<br /><br />
But before using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete">CRUD framework</a>, we need a cruder one, ugly, disgusting but useful for a human before building the REST APIs, writing the class in python, the HTML form, and the controlers.<br /><br />
I call this the <b>crudest CRUD of them all.</b><br /><br />
Think hard at what you want when prototyping ...<br /><br />
<ul>
  <li>to write no CONTROLLERS ; flask documentation has a very verbose approach to exposing routes and writing them, writing controller for embasing and searching databases is boring</li>
  <li>to write the fewer HTML views possible, one and only onle would be great ;</li>
  <li>to avoid having to fiddle the many files reflecting separation of concerns : the lesser python files and class you touch the better; </li>
  <li>to avoid having to write SQL nor use an ORM (at least a verbose declarative one) ;</li>
  <li>show me your code and you can mesmerize and even fool me, however show me your data structure and I'll know everthing I have to know about your application : data structure should be under your nose in a readable fashion in the code;/</li>
  <li>to have AT LEAST one end point for inserting and searching so that curl can be used to begin automation and testing, preferably in a factorisable fashion;</li>
  <li>only one point of failure is accepted</li>
</ul>
<br />Once we set these few condition we see whatever we do WE NEED a dynamic http server at the core. Python being the topic here, we are gonna do it in python.<br /><br />
What is the simplest dynamic web server in python ?<br /><br />The reference implementation of wsgi that is the crudest wsgi server of them all : <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/wsgiref.html">wsgiref</a>. And you don't need to download it since it's provided in python stdlib.<br /><br />
First thing first, we are gonna had a default view so that we can serve an HTML static page with the list of the minimal HTML we need to interact with data : sets of input and forms.<br /><br />
Here, we stop. And we see that these forms are describing the data model.<br /><br />
Wouldn't it be nice if we could parse the HTML form easily with a tool from the standard library : <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/html.parser.html">html.parser</a> and maybe deduce the database model and even more than fields coud add relationship, and well since we are dreaming : what about creating the tables on the fly from the form if they don't exists ?<br /><br />
The encoding of the relationship do require an hijack of convention where when the parser cross a name of the field in the form whatever_id it deduces it is a foreign key to table « whatever », column « id ».<br />
Once this is done, we can parse the html, do some magick to match HTML input types to database types (adapter) and it's almost over. We can even dream of creating the database if it does not exists in a oneliner for sqlite.<br /><br />
We just need to throw away all the frugality of dependencies by the window and spoil our karma of « digital soberty » by adding the almighty sqlalchemy the crudest (but still heavy) ORM when it comes of the field of <a href="https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/orm/extensions/automap.html">the introspective features of an ORM to map a database object to a python object in a clear consistent way</a>.
With this, just one function is needed in the controller to switch from embasing (POST method) and searching (GET).<br /><br />
Well, if the DOM is passed in the request. So of course I see the critics here :
<ul><li>we can't pass the DOM in the request because the HTML form ignores the DOM</li>
  <li>You are not scared of error 415 (request too large) in the get method if you pass the DOM ?</li>
</ul>
That's where we obviously need two important tools : 1) javascript, 2) limitations.<br /><br />
Since we are human we would also like the form to be readable when served, because, well, human don't read the source and can't see the name attributes of the input. A tad of improving the raw html would be nice. It would also give consistency. It will also diminishes the required size of the formular to send. Here, javascript again is the right anwser. Fine, we serve the static page in the top of the controller. Let's use jquery to make it terse enough. Oh, if we have Javascript, wouldn't il be able to clone the part of the invented <i>model</i> tag inside every form so now we can pass the relevant part of the DOM to the controller ?<br /><br />
I think we have everything to write the crudest CRUD server of them all :D 
<br /><br />

<p>We are proud to announce the 7.4 release of <a href="https://www.tryton.org/">Tryton </a>.<br />
This release provides many bug fixes, performance improvements and some fine tuning.<br />
You can give it a <a href="https://www.tryton.org/demo">try on the demo server</a>, <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/tryton/tryton/">use the docker image</a> or <a href="https://www.tryton.org/download">download it here</a>.<br />
As usual <a href="https://docs.tryton.org/7.4/server/topics/setup_database.html#update-a-database">upgrading from previous series</a> is fully supported.</p>
<p>Here is a list of the most noticeable changes:</p>
<h2 id="heading--user">Changes for the User</h2>
<h3 id="heading--user-clients">Clients</h3>
<p>The <code>Many2Many</code> widget now has a restore button to revert the removal of records before saving.</p>
<p>The <code>CSV</code> export window stays open after the export is done so you can refine your export without having the redo all of the configuration.<br />
It also supports exporting and importing translatable fields with a language per column.<br />
The error messages displayed when there is a problem with the <code>CSV</code> import have been improved to include the row and column number of the value that caused the error.</p>
<p>The management window for the favourites has been removed and replaced by a simple “last favorite first” order.</p>
<p>The focus goes back to the search entry after performing a search/refresh.</p>
<p>You can now close a tab by middle clicking on it (as is common in other software).</p>
<h4 id="heading--user-web-client">Web Client</h4>
<p>The left menu and the attachment preview can now be resized so the user can make them the optimal size for their screen.</p>
<h3 id="heading--user-accounting">Accounting</h3>
<p>The minimal chart of accounts has been replaced by the a <a href="https://www.ifrs-gaap.com/universal-chart-accounts">universal chart of accounts</a> which is a good base for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Financial_Reporting_Standards">IFRS</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generally_Accepted_Accounting_Principles_(United_States)">US GAAP</a>.</p>
<p>It is now possible to copy an accounting move from a closed period. The closed period will be replaced by the current period after accepting the warning.</p>
<p>The payments are now numbered to make it easier to identify them inside the application.<br />
An option has been added to the parties to allow direct debits to be created based on the balance instead of the accounting lines.<br />
We’ve added a button on the Stripe payments and Stripe and Braintree customers to allow an updated to be forced. This helps when fixing missed webhooks.</p>
<p>When a stock move is cancelled, the corresponding stock account move is now cancelled automatically.<br />
But it now no longer possible to cancel a done stock move which has been included in a calculation used for anglo-saxon accounting.</p>
<h3 id="heading--user-commission">Commission</h3>
<p>It is now possible to deactivate an agent so that they are no longer used for future orders.</p>
<h3 id="heading--user-company">Company</h3>
<p>It is now possible to add a company logo. This is then displayed in the header of generated documents.</p>
<h3 id="heading--user-incoterm">Incoterm</h3>
<p>A warning is now raised when the incoterm of a shipment is different from the original document (such as the sale or purchase).</p>
<h3 id="heading--user-party">Party</h3>
<p>We’ve added more identifiers for parties like the <em>United Kingdom Unique Taxpayer Reference</em>,  <em>Taiwanese Tax Number</em>,  <em>Turkish tax identification number</em>, <em>El Salvador Tax Number</em>, <em>Singapore’s Unique Entity Number</em>, <em>Montenegro Tax Number</em> and <em>Kenya Tax Number</em>.</p>
<h3 id="heading--user-product">Product</h3>
<p>We’ve added a wizard to manage the replacement of products. Once there is no more stock of the replaced product in any of the warehouses, all the stock on all pending orders are replaced automatically.</p>
<p>A description can now be set for each product image.</p>
<p>There is now a button on the price list form to open the list of lines. This is helpful when the price list has a lot of lines.</p>
<h3 id="heading--user--production">Production</h3>
<p>It is now possible to cancel a done production. All its stock moves are then cancelled.</p>
<p>The Bill of Materials now have an auto-generated internal code.</p>
<h3 id="heading--user-purchase">Purchase</h3>
<p>The wizard to handle exceptions has been improved to clearly display the list of lines to recreate and the list of lines to ignore.</p>
<p>The menu entry <em>Parties associated to Purchases</em> has been removed in favour of the per party reporting.</p>
<p>The purchase amendment now supports amending the quantity of a purchase line using the secondary unit.</p>
<h3 id="heading--user-quality">Quality</h3>
<p>It is now no longer possible to delete non-pending inspections.</p>
<h3 id="heading--user-sale">Sale</h3>
<p>The wizards to handle exceptions have been improved to clearly display the list of lines to recreate and the list of lines to ignore.</p>
<p>The menu entry <em>Parties associated to Sales</em> has been removed in favor of the per party reporting.</p>
<p>A warning is now raised when the user tries to submit a complaint for the same origin as an existing complaint.</p>
<p>The reporting can be grouped per promotion.</p>
<p>From a promotion, it is now possible to list of the sales related to it.<br />
The coupon number of promotion can now be reused once the previous promotion has expired.</p>
<p>The sale amendment now supports amending the quantity of a sale line using the secondary unit.</p>
<h3 id="heading--user-stock">Stock</h3>
<p>It is now possible to cancel a done shipment. When this happens the stock moves of the shipment are cancelled.</p>
<p>The task to reschedule late shipments now includes any shipment that is not yet done.</p>
<p>The supplier shipments no longer have a default planned date.</p>
<p>The customer shipments now have an extra state, <em>Shipped</em>, before the <em>Done</em> state.</p>
<p>The lot trace now shows the inventory as a document.</p>
<p>The package weight and the warehouse are now criteria that can be used when selecting a shipping method.</p>
<h2 id="heading--sysadmin">Changes for the System Administrator</h2>
<p>The clients automatically retry 5 times on a <code>503 Service Unavailable</code> response. They respect the <code>Retry-After</code> value if it is set in the response header. This is useful when performing short maintenance on the server without causing an interruption for the users.</p>
<p>The scheduled tasks now show when they are running and prevent the user from editing them (as they are locked anyway).<br />
We also store their last duration for a month by default. So the administrator can analyze and find slow tasks.</p>
<p>It is now possible to configure a <a href="https://docs.tryton.org/7.4/server/topics/configuration.html#license-key">license key</a> for the TinyMCE editor.<br />
Also TinyMCE has been updated to version 7.</p>
<p>It is now possible to configure the command to use to convert a report to a different format. This allows the use of an external service like <a href="https://code.tryton.org/contrib/document-converter"><code>document-converter</code></a>.</p>
<h3 id="heading--sysadmin-accounting">Accounting</h3>
<p>The <em>Accounting Party</em> group has been merged into the *Accounting" group.</p>
<p>We now raise a warning when the user is changing one of the configured credentials used on external services. This is to prevent accidental modification.</p>
<h3 id="heading--sysadmin-document-incoming">Document Incoming</h3>
<p>It is now possible to set a maximum size for the content of the document incoming requests.</p>
<h3 id="heading--sysadmin-inbound-email">Inbound Email</h3>
<p>It is now possible to set a maximum size for the inbound email requests.</p>
<h3 id="heading--sysadmin-web-shop">Web Shop</h3>
<p>There is now a scheduled task that updates the cache that contains the product data feeds.</p>
<h2 id="heading--developer">Changes for the Developer</h2>
<h3 id="heading--developer-server">Server</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object%E2%80%93relational_mapping">ORM</a> supports <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/rangetypes.html">SQL Range</a> functions and operators to build <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-constraints.html#DDL-CONSTRAINTS-EXCLUSION">exclusion constraints</a>. This allows, for example, the use of non-overlapping constraints using an index.<br />
On PostgreSQL the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/btree-gist.html"><code>btree_gist</code> extension</a> may be needed otherwise the ORM will fallback to locking querying the table.<br />
The SQLite backend adds simple SQL constraints to the table schema.</p>
<p>The relational fields with a filter are no longer copied by default. This was a frequent source of bugs as the same relational field without the filter was already copied so it generated duplicates.</p>
<p>We’ve added a <a href="https://docs.tryton.org/7.4/server/ref/tools/chart.html#trytond.tools.chart.sparkline">sparkline tool</a> to generate textual <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparkline">sparklines</a>. This allows the removal of the <a href="https://www.pygal.org/">pygal</a> dependency.</p>
<p>The <code>activate_modules</code> from testing now accepts a list of setup methods that are run before taking the backup. This speeds up any other tests which restore the backup as they then do not need to run those setup methods.</p>
<p>The backend now has a <a href="https://docs.tryton.org/latest/server/ref/backend.html#trytond.backend.Database.estimated_count">method to estimate the number of rows</a> in a table. This is faster than counting when we only need an estimate, for example when choosing between a join and a sub-query.</p>
<p>We’ve added a <a href="https://docs.tryton.org/latest/server/ref/models.html#trytond.model.ModelSQL.__setup_indexes__"><code>ModelSQL.__setup_indexes__</code> method</a> that prepares the indexes once the <a href="https://docs.tryton.org/latest/server/ref/pool.html#pool"><code>Pool</code></a> has been loaded.</p>
<p>It is now possible to generate many sequential numbers in a single call. This allows, for example, to number a group of invoices with a single call.</p>
<p>The backend now uses <code>JSONB</code> by default for <code>MultiSelection</code> fields. It was already supported, but the database needed to be altered to activate the feature.</p>
<p>You can now define the cardinality (<code>low</code>, <code>normal</code> or <code>high</code>) for the index usage. This allows the backend to choose an optimal type of index to create.</p>
<p>We now have tools that <a href="https://docs.tryton.org/7.4/server/ref/tools/misc.html#trytond.tools.sqlite_apply_types">apply the typing</a> to columns of an SQLite query. This is needed because SQLite doesn’t do a good job of supporting <code>CAST</code>.</p>
<p>The RPC responses are now compressed if their size if large enough and the client accepts it.</p>
<p>The <code>ModelView._changed_values</code> and <code>ModelStorage._save_values</code> are now methods instead of properties. This makes it is easier to debug errors because <code>AttributeError</code> exceptions are no longer hidden.</p>
<p>The scheduled task runner now uses a pool of processes for better parallelism and management. Only the running task is now locked.</p>
<p>We’ve added an environment variable <code>TEST_NETWORK</code> so we can avoid running tests that require network access.</p>
<p>There is now a command line option for exporting translations and storing them as a <code>po</code> file in the corresponding module.<br />
Tryton sets the <code>python-format</code> flag in the <code>po</code> file for the translations containing python formats. This allows Weblate (our <a href="https://translate.tryton.org">translation service</a>) to check if the translations keep the right placeholders.</p>
<h3 id="heading--developer-accounting">Accounting</h3>
<p>The payment amounts are now cached on the account move line to improve the performance when searching for lines to pay.<br />
The payment amounts now have to be greater or equal to zero.</p>
<h3 id="heading--developer-purchase">Purchase</h3>
<p>Only purchase lines of type <em>line</em> can be used as an origin for a stock move.</p>
<h3 id="heading--developer-sale">Sale</h3>
<p>Only sales lines of type <em>line</em> can be used as an origin for a stock move.</p>
<p>The fields from the <em>Sale Shipment Cost Module</em> are now all prefixed with <code>sale_</code>.</p>
<h3 id="heading--developer-stock">Stock</h3>
<p>Cancelled moves are no longer included in the shipment and package measurements.</p>

</div>

<p>This article is an introduction to meaningful automation, integrations and interoperability with Zato, service-oriented thinking and Python.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://upcdn.io/kW15bqq/raw/root/static/img/intro/high-level.png" /></p>
<p><a href="https://zato.io/">Zato</a> is <strong>a convenient and secure, Python-based, open-source, service-oriented platform for automation, integrations and interoperability.</strong>
It is used to connect distributed systems or data sources and to build API-focused, middleware and backend applications.</p>
<p>The platform is designed and built specifically with Python users in mind - often working in, and for, industries such as
<a href="https://zato.io/en/industry/telecom/index.html">telecommunications</a>,
<a href="https://zato.io/en/industry/defense/index.html">defense</a>,
<a href="https://zato.io/en/industry/healthcare/index.html">health care</a>
and others that require automation, integrations and interoperability of multiple systems and processes.</p>
<p>Sample real-world, mission-critical Zato environments include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Systems for <strong>telecommunication operators</strong> integrating CRM, ERP, Charging Systems, Billing and other <strong>OSS/BSS</strong>
  applications internal or external to the operators, including <strong>network automation</strong> of <strong>packet brokers</strong>
  and other <strong>network visibility</strong> and <strong>cybersecurity</strong> tools from <a href="https://www.keysight.com/us/en/home.html">Keysight</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Enterprise services buses</strong> for <strong>government</strong>, helping in the <strong>digital transformation</strong> of <strong>legacy</strong> systems
  and processes towards <strong>modern capabilities</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>AI</strong>, <strong>ML</strong> and <strong>data science</strong> systems that analyze and improve <strong>acquisition</strong> and <strong>supply chain</strong> activities in
  <strong>government</strong> processes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Applied observability</strong> automation that enables <strong>meaningful decision making</strong> through
  the orchestration and coordination of the collection, distribution and presentation of data spread across
  a pool of independent systems</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Platforms for <strong>health care</strong> and  <strong>public administration</strong> systems, helping to achieve <strong>data interoperability</strong> through the
  integration of independent data sources, databases and health information exchanges (HIE)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Global <strong>IoT</strong> platforms for <strong>hybrid integrations</strong> of medical devices and software both in the <strong>cloud</strong> and <strong>on premises</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cybersecurity</strong> automation, including <strong>IT/OT hardware</strong> and software assets</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Robotic process automation (RPA)</strong> of <strong>message flows</strong> and <strong>events</strong> produced by early warning systems</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Zato offers connectors to all the popular technologies and vendors, such as REST, Cloud, task scheduling, Microsoft 365,
Salesforce, Atlassian, SAP, Odoo, SQL, HL7, FHIR, AMQP, IBM MQ, LDAP, Redis, MongoDB, WebSockets, SOAP, Caching and many more.</p>
<p>Running in the cloud, on premises, or under Docker, Kubernetes and other container technologies, Zato services are
optimized for high performance and security - it is easily possible to run hundreds and thousands of services on typical server
instances as offered by Amazon, Google Cloud, Azure or other cloud providers.</p>
<p>Zato servers offer high availability and no-downtime deployment. Servers form clusters that are used to scale
systems both horizontally and vertically.</p>
<p>The product is commercial open-source software with
<a href="https://zato.io/en/services/index.html">training, professional services and enterprise 24x7x365 support</a> available.</p>
<h2 id="a-platform-and-language-for-interesting-reusable-and-atomic-services">A platform and language for interesting, reusable and atomic services</h2>
<p>Zato promotes the design of, and helps you build, solutions composed of services
that are <strong>interesting, reusable and atomic (IRA)</strong>.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://upcdn.io/kW15bqq/raw/root/static/img/intro/ira.png" /></p>
<p>What does it really mean in practice that something is interesting, reusable and atomic? In particular,
how do we define what is <strong>interesting</strong>?</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://upcdn.io/kW15bqq/raw/root/static/img/intro/service-interesting.png" /></p>
<p>Each <strong>interesting</strong> service should make its users want to keep using it more and more. People should immediately see
the value of using the service in their processes. An interesting service strikes everyone as immediately useful in wider
contexts, preferably with few or no conditions, prerequisites and obligations.</p>
<p>An interesting service is aesthetically pleasing, both in terms of its technical usage as well as its
relevance to, and potential applicability in, fields broader than originally envisioned. If people check the service and say
"I know, we will definitely use it" or "Why don't we use it" you know that the service is interesting.
If they say "Oh no, not this one again" or "No, thanks, but no" then it is the opposite.</p>
<p>Note that focus here is on the <strong>value</strong> that the service brings for the user. You constantly need to keep in mind
that people generally want to use services only if they allow them to fulfill their plans or execute some bigger ideas.
Perhaps they already have them in mind and they are only looking for technical means of achieving that or perhaps
it is your services that will make a person realize that something is possible at all, but the point is the same,
your service should serve a grander purpose.</p>
<p>This mindset, of wanting to build things that are useful and interesting is not specific to Python or, indeed,
to software and technology. Even if you are designing and implementing services for your own purposes,
you need to act as if you were a consultant that can always see a bigger vision, a bigger architecture, and who
can envision results that are still ahead in the future while at the same time not forgetting that it is always
a series of small interesting actions, that everyone can relate to, that lead to success.</p>
<p>A curious observation can be made, particularly when you consider all the various aspects of the <strong>digital transformation</strong>
that companies and organizations go through, is that many people to whom the services are addressed, or who sponsor
their development, are surprised when they see what automation and integrations are capable.</p>
<p>Put differently, many people can only begin to visualize bigger designs once they see in practice smaller, practical
results that further their missions, careers and otherwise help them at work. This is why, again, the focus on being
interesting is essential.</p>
<p>At the same, it can be at times advantageous to you that people will not see automation or integrations coming. That lets you
take the lead and build a center of such a fundamental shift around yourself. This is a great position to be in,
a blue ocean of possibilities, because it means little to no competition inside an organization that you are a part of.</p>
<p>If you are your own audience, that is, if you build services for your own
purposes, the same principles apply and it is easy to observe that thinking in services lets you build a toolbox of reusable,
complementary capabilities, a portfolio, that you can take with you as you progress in your career. For instance, your services,
and your work, can concentrate on a particular vendor and with a set of services that automate their products,
you will be always able to put that into use, shorting your own development time, no matter who employs you and in what way.</p>
<p>Regardless of who the clients that you build the solutions for are, observe that automation and integrations with services
are evolutionary and incremental in their nature, at least initially. Yes, the resulting value can often be revolutionary
but you do not intend to incur any massive changes until there are clear, interesting results available. Trying to integrate
and change existing systems at the same time is doable, but not trivial, and it is best left to later stages, once your
automation gets the necessary buy-in from the organization.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://upcdn.io/kW15bqq/raw/root/static/img/intro/service-reusable.png" /></p>
<p>Services should be ready to be used in different, independent processes. The processes can be strictly business ones, such as
processing of orders or payments, or they can be of a deep, technical nature, e.g. automating cybersecurity hardware. What matters
in either case is that <strong>reusability breeds both flexibility and stability</strong>.</p>
<p>There is inherent flexibility in being able to compose bigger processes out of smaller blocks with clearly defined boundaries,
which can easily translate to increased competitive advantage when services are placed into more and more areas.
A direct result of this is a <strong>reduction in R&amp;D time</strong> as, over time, you are able to choose from a collection
of loosely-coupled components, the services, that hide implementation details of a particular system or technology
that they automate or integrate with.</p>
<p>Through their continued use in different processes, services can reduce
overall implementation risks that are always part of any kind of software development - you will know that you can keep
reusing stable functionality that has been already well tested and that is used elsewhere.</p>
<p>Because services are reusable, there is no need for gigantic, pure waterfall-style implementations of automation and integrations
in an organization. Each individual project can contribute a smaller set of services that, as a whole, constitute the whole
integrated environment. Conversely, each new project can start to reuse services delivered by the previous ones,
hence allowing you to quickly, incrementally, prove the value of the investment in service-oriented thinking.</p>
<p>To make them reusable, services are designed in a way that hides their implementation details. Users only need to know how
to invoke the service; the specific systems or processes it automates or integrates are not necessarily
important for them to know as long as a specific business goal is achieved. Thanks to that, both services and what
they integrate can be replaced without disrupting other parts - in reality, this is exactly what happens - systems with
various kinds of data will be changed or modernized but the service will stay the same and the user will not notice anything.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://upcdn.io/kW15bqq/raw/root/static/img/intro/service-atomic.png" /></p>
<p>Each service fulfills a single, atomic business need. Each service is deployed independently and, as a whole, they constitute
an implementation of business processes taking place in your company or organization. Note that the definition of what the
business need is, again, specific to your own needs. In purely market-oriented integrations, this may mean, for instance,
the opening of a bank account. In IT or OT automation, on the other hand, it may mean the reconfiguration of a specific device.</p>
<p>That services are atomic also means that they are discrete and that their functionality is finely grained. You will recognize
whether a design goes in this direction if consider the names of the services for a moment. An atomic service will invariably
use a short name consisting of a single verb and noun. For instance, "Create Customer Account", "Stop Firewall",
"Conduct Feasibility Study", it is easy to see that we cannot break them down into smaller part, they are atomic.</p>
<p>At the same time, you will keep creating composite services that invoke other services; this is natural and as expected
but you will not consider services such as "Create Customer Account and Set Up a SIM Card" as atomic ones because, in that form,
they will not be very reusable, and a major part of why being atomic is important is that it promotes reusability. For instance,
having separate services to create customer accounts, independently of setting up their SIM cards, is that one can without
difficulty foresee situations when an account is created but a SIM card is purchased at a later time and, conversely,
surely one customer account should be able to potentially have multiple SIM cards. Think of it as being similar to LEGO bricks
where just a few basic shapes can form millions of interesting combinations.</p>
<p>The point about service naming conventions is well worth remembering because this lets you maintain a vocabulary
that is common to both technical and business people. A technical person will understand that such naming is akin to the CRUD
convention from the web programming world while a business person will find it easy to map the meaning to a specific
business function within a broader business process.</p>

<p>With Zato, you use Python to focus on the business logic exclusively and the platform takes care of scalability, availability
 communications protocols, messaging, security or routing. This lets you concentrate only on what is the very core of systems
 integrations - making sure their services are interesting, reusable and atomic.</p>
<p>Python is the perfect choice for this job because it hits the sweet spot under several key headings:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It is a very high level language, with a syntax close to how grammar of various spoken languages works,
  which makes it easy to translate business requirements into implementation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is a solid, mainstream and full-featured, real programming language rather than a domain-specific one which
  means that it offers a great degree of flexibility and choice in expressing their needs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is difficult to find universities without Python courses. Most people entering the workforce already know Python,
  it is a new career language. In fact, it is becoming more and more difficult to find new talent who would not prefer
  to use Python.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yet, one does not need to be a developer or a full-time programmer to use Python. In fact, most people who use Python
  are not programmers at all. They are specialists in other fields who also need to use a programming language to
  automate or integrate their work in a meaningful way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many Python users come from backgrounds in network and cybersecurity engineering - fields that naturally require a lot of
  automation using a real language that is convenient and easy to get started with</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many Python users are scientists with a background in AI, ML and data science, applying their domain-specific knowledge
  in processes that, by their very nature, require them to collect and integrate data from independent sources,
  which again leads to automation and integrations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many Python users have a strong web programming background which means that it takes little effort
  to take a step further, towards automation and integrations. In turn, this means that it is easy
  to find good people for API projects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many Python users know multiple programming languages - this is very useful in the context of integration projects
  where one is typically faced with dozens of technologies, vendors or integration methods and techniques.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lower maintenance costs - thanks to the language's unique design, Python programmers
  tend to produce code that is easy to read and understand. From the perspective of multi-year maintenance,
  reading and analyzing code, rather than writing it, is what most programmers do most of the time,
  making sense to use a language that makes it easy to carry out the most common tasks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, Python can be construed as executable pseudo-code with many of its users already having roots in
modern server-side programming so Zato, both from a technical and strategic perspective, is a natural choice for
both simple and complex, sophisticated automation, integration and interoperability solutions as a platform built in the
language and designed for Python people from day one.</p>

            <p>’Tis the season when people are posting their “Django wishlists”, for specific technical or organizational or community initiatives they’d like to see undertaken. Here are a few examples from around the Django&nbsp;community:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://gist.github.com/sarahboyce/68ffaaeae24d2501cf27a914f77fb97c">Sarah&nbsp;Boyce</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.better-simple.com">Tim&nbsp;Schilling</a></li>
<li><a href="https://softwarecrafts.co.uk/100-words/day-203">Andy&nbsp;Miller</a></li>
<li><a href="https://emma.has-a.blog/articles/django-wishlist-explained.html">Emma&nbsp;Delescolle</a></li>
</ul>
<p>So, in the spirit of the season, here is my own list, which I’ve narrowed down to three wishes (in the tradition of many stories about wishes), consisting of one organizational item and two technical&nbsp;ones.</p>
<h3>Pass the&nbsp;torch</h3>
<p>This one requires a bit of background, so please bear with&nbsp;me.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/">The Django Software Foundation</a> — usually just abbreviated “<span class="caps">DSF</span>” — is the nonprofit organization which officially “owns” Django. It’s the legal holder of all the intellectual property, including both the copyright to the original Django codebase (generously donated by the Lawrence Journal-World, where it was first developed) and the trademarks, such as the registered trademark on the name “Django” itself. The <span class="caps">DSF</span> does a lot (and could do more, with a bigger budget) to support the Django community, and offers financial support to the development of Django itself, but does <em>not</em> directly develop Django, or oversee Django’s development or technical&nbsp;direction.</p>
<p>Originally, that job went to Django co-creators Adrian Holovaty and Jacob Kaplan-Moss. They granted commit permissions to a growing team of collaborators, but remained the technical leaders of the Django project until 2014, when they stepped aside and a new body, called the Technical Board, was introduced to replace them. The Technical Board was elected by the Django committers — by this point usually referred to as “Django Core” — and although the committers continued to have broad authority to make additions or changes to Django’s codebase, the Technical Board became the ultimate decision-maker for things that needed a tie-breaking vote, or that were too large for a single committer to do solo (usually via Django Enhancement Proposals, or DEPs, modeled on the processes of many other open-source projects, including Python’s&nbsp;“PEPs”).</p>
<p>One thing the <span class="caps">DSF</span> <em>has</em> done is use some of its funds on <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/fundraising/#fellowship-program">the Django Fellowship program</a>, which pays contractors (the “Django Fellows”) to carry out tasks like ticket triage, pull-request review, etc. which would otherwise rely on volunteer labor (with all the problems that&nbsp;involves).</p>
<p>But the system of “Django Core” committers and Technical Board did not work out especially well. Many of the committers were either intermittently active or just completely inactive, new committers were added rarely if ever, and it was unclear what sort of path there was (or even if there <em>was</em> a path) for a motivated contributor to work their way toward committer status. About the only thing that did work well was the Fellowship program, which largely was what kept Django running as a software project toward the end of that&nbsp;era.</p>
<p>This caused a lot of debates focused on the theme of what to do about “Django Core” and how to reform the project and get it back on a healthy footing. The end result of that was a Django Enhancement Proposal numbered as <span class="caps">DEP</span> 10, which I spent most of 2018 and 2019 working on. I <a href="https://www.b-list.org/weblog/2018/nov/20/core/">wrote an explanation at the time</a>, and I’ll just link it here and mention that <span class="caps">DEP</span> 10 (which passed <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2020/mar/12/governance/">in early 2020</a>) kept the Technical Board as a tie-breaking and oversight body, and introduced two other main roles — “Mergers” and “Releasers” — which have mostly but not exclusively been filled by the Django Fellows. The first <span class="caps">DEP</span> 10 Technical Board drafted and passed another <span class="caps">DEP</span>, <span class="caps">DEP</span> 12, renaming themselves to “Steering Council” (similar to Python’s technical governing body, but a name I’ve never liked because the Django version doesn’t meaningfully “steer” Django) and making a few&nbsp;tweaks.</p>
<p>So, that brings us to the present day. Where, sadly, the <span class="caps">DEP</span> 10/12 era is looking like as much of a failure as the preceding “Django Core” + committer-elected Technical Board era. The <span class="caps">DEP</span> 10 Technical Boards/Steering Councils have been dysfunctional at best, and there’s been no influx of new people from outside the former “Django Core”. A stark example: I ran for the the Steering Council last year to try to work on fixing some of this, but the Steering Council election attracted only four total candidates for five seats, all of them former “Django Core”&nbsp;members.</p>
<p>Recently there was a lot of discussion on the <span class="caps">DSF</span> members’ forum about what to do with the Steering Council, and a few attempts to take action which failed in frustrating ways. The end result was the resignation of two Steering Council members, which brought the group below quorum and has automatically triggered an election (though one that will run under the existing <span class="caps">DEP</span> 10/12 rules, since triggering an election locks the eligibility and election rules against&nbsp;changes).</p>
<p>I believe the ongoing inability to develop stable technical governance and meaningful turnover of technical leadership is the single greatest threat to Django’s continued viability as a project. This is an unfortunate vindication of what I said six years ago in that blog post about developing <span class="caps">DEP</span>&nbsp;10:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Django’s at risk of being badly off in the future; for some time now, the project has not managed to bring in new committers at a sufficient rate to replace those who’ve become less active or even entirely inactive, and that’s not sustainable for much&nbsp;longer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The good news is there’s a new generation of contributors who I believe are more than ready to take up the technical leadership of Django, and even a structured program — <em>not</em> run by former “Django Core”! —  <a href="https://djangonaut.space">for recruiting and mentoring new contributors on an ongoing basis and helping them build familiarity with working on and contributing to Django</a>. The bad news is there’s a huge obstacle in their way: all of us old-time “Django Core” folks who keep occupying all the official leadership positions. Just recruiting people to run against such long-time well-known names in the project is difficult, and actually <em>winning</em> against us probably close to&nbsp;impossible.</p>
<p>So the biggest thing I’d like for Django, right now, is for the entire former “Django Core” group — myself included! — to simply <em>get out of the way</em>. I thought I could come back last year and help fix things after stepping down post-<span class="caps">DEP</span>-10, but doing so was a mistake and only prolonged the problem. I will not be running in the upcoming Steering Council election and I <em>beg</em> my “Django Core” colleagues to all do likewise. There are qualified, motivated folks out there who should be given their chance to step up and run things, and we should collectively place Django into their capable hands. Then they can sort out the rest of the technical governance however they see&nbsp;fit.</p>
<p>And honestly, I’ve been in and out of just about every formal role the Django project has for (checks calendar) seventeen years now. It’s <em>time</em>. It’s time for me, and the rest of the old guard, to give way to new folks before we do serious harm to Django by continuing to hold on to leadership&nbsp;roles.</p>
<h3>Give Django a&nbsp;hint</h3>
<p>Python 3.0 introduced the ability to add “annotations” to function and method declarations, and though it didn’t specify what they were to be used for, people almost immediately started developing ways to specify static type information via annotations, which came to be known as “type hints”. Python 3.5 formalized this and introduced <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html">the <code>typing</code> module in the standard library</a> with tools to make the type-hint use case easier, and Python 3.6 introduced the ability to annotate other names, including standalone variables and class&nbsp;attributes.</p>
<p>Django has a complicated history with this feature of modern Python. There’ve been multiple efforts to add type annotations directly in Django’s own code, there’s <a href="https://pypi.org/project/django-stubs/">a third-party package</a> which provides annotations as an add-on, <a href="https://github.com/django/deps/pull/65">a proposed <span class="caps">DEP</span></a> never went anywhere because <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/django-developers/c/C_Phs05kL1Q/m/fE301y-JCQAJ">the Technical Board at the time was against it</a>, and it’s just been stuck as a frequently-requested feature ever&nbsp;since.</p>
<p>Let me be absolutely clear: I don’t have any issue with statically-typed programming languages as a concept. I’ve used both statically- and dynamically-typed languages and liked and disliked examples of each. If I weren’t writing Python, personally I probably would be writing C# (statically-typed). But I also have absolutely no interest in static type checking for Python as a feature or a use&nbsp;case.</p>
<p>What I <em>do</em> have an interest in is all the other use cases type hints enable. There’s a whole booming ecosystem of modern Python tools out there now which use type hints to enable all sorts of interesting <em>runtime</em> behavior. <a href="https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/">Pydantic</a> and <a href="https://jcristharif.com/msgspec/">msgspec</a> do runtime derivation of validation and serialization/deserialization behavior from type hints. <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com">FastAPI</a> and <a href="https://litestar.dev">Litestar</a> are web frameworks which use type hints to drive input/output schemas, dependency injection and more. <a href="https://www.sqlalchemy.org">SQLAlchemy</a> as of version 2.0 can use type hints to drive <span class="caps">ORM</span> class&nbsp;definitions.</p>
<p>I am <em>very</em> interested in those sorts of things, and right now they’re not available from vanilla Django because Django doesn’t do type hints (you can use <a href="https://django-ninja.dev">a third-party package</a> to turn Django into something resembling one of the newer type-hint-driven frameworks, but it’s an extra package and a whole new way of doing things that doesn’t “feel like&nbsp;Django”).</p>
<p>Compare, for example, this Django <span class="caps">ORM</span>&nbsp;model:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">django.db</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">models</span>

<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Person</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">models</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Model</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">models</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">CharField</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="n">date_of_birth</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">models</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">DateField</span><span class="p">()</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>With its modern SQLAlchemy&nbsp;equivalent:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">datetime</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">date</span>   
<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">sqlalchemy.orm</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">DeclarativeBase</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">Mapped</span>

<span class="n">Base</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">DeclarativeBase</span><span class="p">()</span>

<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Person</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Base</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">__tablename__</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;person&quot;</span>
    <span class="n">name</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">Mapped</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">]</span>
    <span class="n">date_of_birth</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">Mapped</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">date</span><span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>You <em>can</em> use SQLAlchemy’s <code>mapped_column()</code> function to be more verbose and specify a bunch more information, but for a basic column you <em>don’t have to</em>. Just write a type hint and it does the right&nbsp;thing.</p>
<p>I think type hint support in Django has the potential to unlock a huge variety of useful new features and conveniences, and the lack of it is causing Django to fall well behind the current state of the art in Python web development. So if I could somehow wave a magic wand and get any single technical change instantly made to Django, type hints would be&nbsp;it.</p>
<h3>More generic&nbsp;Django</h3>
<p>Django includes a feature known as “generic views” (keep in mind that Django doesn’t strictly follow regular <span class="caps">MVC</span> terminology, and so a Django “view” is what most pure <span class="caps">MVC</span> implementations would call the “controller”), which are reusable implementations of common operations like “<span class="caps">CRUD</span>” (create, retrieve, update, delete operations — including both individual-result and list-of-results), date-based archives of data,&nbsp;etc.</p>
<p>And basically everybody agrees Django’s generic views are too complicated. There’s a giant complex <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/ref/class-based-views/">inheritance tree of classes</a> involved, with a huge mess of different attributes and methods you can set or override to affect behavior depending on exactly which set of classes you’re inheriting from, creating a steep learning curve and requiring even experienced developers to spend a lot of time with both official and unofficial documentation (<a href="https://ccbv.co.uk">ccbv.co.uk</a> is the usual reference people are directed&nbsp;to).</p>
<p>There’s a reason for this complexity: originally, Django’s generic views were <em>functions</em>, not classes, and you customized their behavior by passing arguments to them. The class-based generic views were introduced in Django 1.3 (released in 2011), and for compatibility and ease of migration at the time, were implemented in a way which <em>precisely</em> mirrored the functionality of the function-based views. Which means that for every thing you could do via an argument to the function-based views, there is a mixin class, method, or attribute on the class-based ones corresponding to&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>This made some sense at the time, because it was a big migration to ask people to go through. It makes much less sense now, over 13 years later, when the complexity of Django’s hierarchy of class-based views mostly just scares people and makes them not want to use what is otherwise a pretty useful feature: class-based views are a huge reduction in repetitive/boilerplate code when you know how to use them (for example, see <a href="https://github.com/ubernostrum/b_list/blob/main/blog/views.py">the views used by this site</a> for date-based browsing of entries and detail/list views of entries by category — that really is all the code needed to provide all the backend&nbsp;logic).</p>
<p>At this point the overcomplexity of Django’s generic views is basically a meme in the community, and is one of the things I see most often cited by new Django users as making their experience difficult. So if I were going to be given the magic wand a second time and allowed to make another instant technical change, it’d be to finally deprecate the complicated generic-view class hierarchy and replace it with a ground-up rewrite aimed at providing a clear, powerful <span class="caps">API</span> rather than maintaining compatibility with a set of older functions that were deprecated nearly a decade and a half&nbsp;ago.</p>
<h3>What do you wish&nbsp;for?</h3>
<p>Of course, there’s a lot more that <em>could</em> be done to or for Django besides the three items I’ve outlined here. I’d encourage anyone who uses Django to think about what <em>they’d</em> like to see, to post about it, and, ideally, to get involved with Django’s development. That’s not just a way to get bits of your own wishlist implemented; it’s also the way to make sure Django continues to be around for people to have wishes about, and I hope that continues for many years to&nbsp;come.</p>
