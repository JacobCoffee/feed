            <p>Turns out you can just port things now.  I already attempted this experiment in
the summer, but it turned out to be a bit too much for what I had time for.
However, things have advanced since.  Yesterday I ported
<a href="https://github.com/mitsuhiko/minijinja">MiniJinja</a> (a Rust Jinja2 template
engine) to native Go, and I used an agent to do pretty much all of the work.  In
fact, I barely did anything beyond giving some high-level guidance on how I
thought it could be accomplished.</p>
<p>In total I probably spent around 45 minutes actively with it.  It worked for
around 3 hours while I was watching, then another 7 hours alone.  This post is a
recollection of what happened and what I learned from it.</p>
<p>All prompting was done by voice using <a href="https://buildwithpi.ai/">pi</a>, starting
with Opus 4.5 and switching to GPT-5.2 Codex for the long tail of test fixing.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mitsuhiko/minijinja/pull/854">PR #854</a></li>
<li><a href="https://shittycodingagent.ai/session/?29f75b708237ceead8b1c8cb55ea2305">Pi session transcript</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqzY8Adxxns">Narrated video of the porting session</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>What is MiniJinja</h2>
<p>MiniJinja is a re-implementation of Jinja2 for Rust. I originally wrote it
because I wanted to do a infrastructure automation project in Rust and Jinja was
popular for that.  The original project didn&#8217;t go anywhere, but MiniJinja itself
continued being useful for both me and other users.</p>
<p>The way MiniJinja is tested is with snapshot tests: inputs and expected outputs,
using <a href="https://insta.rs/">insta</a> to verify they match.  These snapshot tests were
what I wanted to use to validate the Go port.</p>
<h2>Test-Driven Porting</h2>
<p>My initial prompt asked the agent to figure out how to validate the port.
Through that conversation, the agent and I aligned on a path: reuse the existing
Rust snapshot tests and port incrementally (lexer -&gt; parser -&gt; runtime).</p>
<p>This meant the agent built Go-side tooling to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Parse Rust&#8217;s test input files (which embed settings as JSON headers).</li>
<li>Parse the reference insta <code>.snap</code> snapshots and compare output.</li>
<li>Maintain a skip-list to temporarily opt out of failing tests.</li>
</ul>
<p>This resulted in a pretty good harness with a tight feedback loop.  The agent had
a clear goal (make everything pass) and a progression (lexer -&gt; parser -&gt;
runtime).  The tight feedback loop mattered particularly at the end where it was
about getting details right.  Every missing behavior had one or more failing
snapshots.</p>
<h2>Branching in Pi</h2>
<p>I used Pi&#8217;s branching feature to structure the session into phases.  I rewound
back to earlier parts of the session and used the branch switch feature to
inform the agent automatically what it had already done.  This is similar to
compaction, but Pi shows me what it puts into the context.  When Pi switches
branches it does two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>It stays in the same session so I can navigate around, but it makes a new
branch off an earlier message.</li>
<li>When switching, it adds a summary of what it did as a priming message into
where it branched off.  I found this quite helpful to avoid the agent doing
vision quests from scratch to figure out how far it had already gotten.</li>
</ol>
<p>Without switching branches, I would probably just make new sessions and have
more plan files lying around or use something like Amp&#8217;s handoff feature which
also allows the agent to consult earlier conversations if it needs more
information.</p>
<h2>First Signs of Divergence</h2>
<p>What was interesting is that the agent went from literal porting to behavioral
porting quite quickly.  I didn&#8217;t steer it away from this as long as the behavior
aligned.  I let it do this for a few reasons.  First, the code base isn&#8217;t that
large, so I felt I could make adjustments at the end if needed.  Letting the
agent continue with what was already working felt like the right strategy.
Second, it was aligning to idiomatic Go much better this way.</p>
<p>For instance, on the runtime it implemented a tree-walking interpreter (not a
bytecode interpreter like Rust) and it decided to use Go&#8217;s reflection for the
value type.  I didn&#8217;t tell it to do either of these things, but they made more
sense than replicating my Rust interpreter design, which was partly motivated by
not having a garbage collector or runtime type information.</p>
<h2>Where I Had to Push Back</h2>
<p>On the other hand, the agent made some changes while making tests pass that I
disagreed with.  It completely gave up on all the &#8220;must fail&#8221; tests because the
error messages were impossible to replicate perfectly given the runtime
differences.  So I had to steer it towards fuzzy matching instead.</p>
<p>It also wanted to regress behavior I wanted to retain (e.g., exact HTML escaping
semantics, or that <code>range</code> must return an iterator).  I think if I hadn&#8217;t steered
it there, it might not have made it to completion without going down problematic
paths, or I would have lost confidence in the result.</p>
<h2>Grinding to Full Coverage</h2>
<p>Once the major semantic mismatches were fixed, the remaining work was filling
in all missing pieces: missing filters and test functions, loop extras, macros,
call blocks, etc.  Since I wanted to go to bed, I switched to Codex 5.2 and
queued up a few &#8220;continue making all tests pass if they are not passing yet&#8221;
prompts, then let it work through compaction.  I felt confident enough that the
agent could make the rest of the tests pass without guidance once it had the
basics covered.</p>
<p>This phase ran without supervision overnight.</p>
<h2>Final Cleanup</h2>
<p>After functional convergence, I asked the agent to document internal functions
and reorganize (like moving filters to a separate file).  I also asked it to
document all functions and filters like in the Rust code base.  This was also
when I set up CI, release processes, and talked through what was created to come
up with some finalizing touches before merging.</p>
<h2>Parting Thoughts</h2>
<p>There are a few things I find interesting here.</p>
<p>First: these types of ports are possible now.  I know porting was already
possible for many months, but it required much more attention.  This changes some
dynamics.  I feel less like technology choices are constrained by ecosystem lock-in.
Sure, porting NumPy to Go would be a more involved undertaking, and getting it
competitive even more so (years of optimizations in there).  But still, it feels
like many more libraries can be used now.</p>
<p>Second: for me, the value is shifting from the code to the tests and
documentation.  A good test suite might actually be worth more than the code.
That said, this isn&#8217;t an argument for keeping tests secret &#8212; generating tests
with good coverage is also getting easier.  However, for keeping code bases in
different languages in sync, you need to agree on shared tests, otherwise
divergence is inevitable.</p>
<p>Lastly, there&#8217;s the social dynamic.  Once, having people port your code to other
languages was something to take pride in.  It was a sign of accomplishment &#8212; a
project was &#8220;cool enough&#8221; that someone put time into making it available
elsewhere.  With agents, it doesn&#8217;t invoke the same feelings.  Will McGugan
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/willmcgugan.bsky.social/post/3mccn3l4qdk26">also called out this
change</a>.</p>
<h2>Session Stats</h2>
<p>Lastly, some boring stats for the main session:</p>
<ul>
<li>Agent run duration: <del>10 hours (</del>3 hours supervised)</li>
<li>Active human time: ~45 minutes</li>
<li>Total messages: 2,698</li>
<li>My prompts: 34</li>
<li>Tool calls: 1,386</li>
<li>Raw API token cost: $60</li>
<li>Total tokens: 2.2 million</li>
<li>Models: <code>claude-opus-4-5</code> and <code>gpt-5.2-codex</code> for the unattended overnight run</li>
</ul>
<p>This did not count the adding of doc strings and smaller fixups.</p>

            <p><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-size: 11pt;">We are thrilled to announce that Anthropic has entered into a two-year partnership with the Python Software Foundation (PSF) to contribute a landmark total of $1.5 million to support the foundation’s work, with an emphasis on Python ecosystem security. This investment will enable the PSF to make crucial security advances to CPython and the Python Package Index (PyPI) benefiting all users, and it will also sustain the foundation’s core work supporting the Python language, ecosystem, and global community.</span></p><div><b><span face="Arial, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;">Innovating open source security</span></span><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-size: 11pt;">

Planned projects include creating new tools for automated proactive review of all packages uploaded to PyPI, improving on the current process of reactive-only review. We intend to create a new dataset of known malware that will allow us to design these novel tools, relying on capability analysis. One of the advantages of this project is that we expect the outputs we develop to be transferable to all open source package repositories. As a result, this work has the potential to ultimately improve security across multiple open source ecosystems, starting with the Python ecosystem.</span></span></div><div><span face="Arial, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;"><br /></span></span></div><div><span face="Arial, sans-serif"><div><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;">This work will build on <a href="https://sethmlarson.dev/">PSF Security Developer in Residence Seth Larson</a>’s security roadmap with contributions from <a href="https://www.miketheman.net/">PyPI Safety and Security Engineer Mike Fiedler</a>, both roles generously funded by <a href="https://alpha-omega.dev/">Alpha-Omega</a>.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;"><b>Sustaining the Python language, ecosystem, and community

            Your cloud SSD is sitting there, bored, and it would like a job. Today we’re putting it to work with DiskCache, a simple, practical cache built on SQLite that can speed things up without spinning up Redis or extra services. Once you start to see what it can do, a universe of possibilities opens up. We're joined by Vincent Warmerdam to dive into DiskCache.

            When working with Qt slots and signals in PyQt6 you will discover the <code>@pyqtSlot</code> decorator. This decorator is used to <em>mark</em> a Python function or method as a <em>slot</em> to which a Qt signal can be connected. However, as you can see in our <a href="">signals and slots tutorials</a> you don't <em>have</em> to use this. Any Python function or method can be used, normally, as a slot for a Qt signals. But elsewhere, in our <a href="https://www.pythonguis.com/tutorials/multithreading-pyqt6-applications-qthreadpool/">threading tutorials</a> we <em>do</em> use it.

<p>This is a quick guide on how to turn SSH commands into a REST API service. The use-case may be remote administration
of devices or equipment that does not offer a REST interface or making sure that access to SSH commands is restricted
to selected external REST-based API clients only.</p>
<h2 id="python">Python</h2>
<p>The first thing needed is code of the service that will connect to SSH servers. Below is a service doing just that -
it receives name of the command to execute and host to run in on, translating stdout and stderr of SSH commands
into response documents which Zato in turn serializes to JSON.</p>

<h2 id="dashboard">Dashboard</h2>
<p>In the Zato Dashboard, let's go ahead and create an HTTP Basic Auth definition that a remote API client will authenticate against:</p>

<img src="https://upcdn.io/kW15bqq/raw/root/static/blog/images/3.2-ssh/basic-auth-menu.png" />
</center>

<p><img src="https://upcdn.io/kW15bqq/raw/root/static/blog/images/3.2-ssh/basic-auth-form.png" /></p>
<p>Now, the SSH service can be mounted on a newly created REST channel - note the security definition used and that data format is set to JSON.
We can skip all the other details such as caching or rate limiting, for illustration purposes, this is not needed.</p>
<p><img src="https://upcdn.io/kW15bqq/raw/root/static/blog/images/3.2-ssh/rest-menu.png" /></p>
<p><img src="https://upcdn.io/kW15bqq/raw/root/static/blog/images/3.2-ssh/rest-form.png" /></p>
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>At this point, everything is ready to use. We could make it accessible to external API clients but, for testing purposes,
let's simply invoke our SSH API gateway service from the command line:</p>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="line-1-1" name="line-1-1"></a><a href="#line-1-1"><span class="linenos"></span></a>$<span class="w"> </span>curl<span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;api:password@localhost:11223/api/ssh&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span>-d<span class="w"> </span><span class="se">\</span>
<a id="line-1-2" name="line-1-2"></a><a href="#line-1-2"><span class="linenos"></span></a><span class="w">    </span><span class="s1">'{&quot;host&quot;:&quot;localhost&quot;, &quot;command&quot;:&quot;uptime&quot;}'</span>
<a id="line-1-3" name="line-1-3"></a><a href="#line-1-3"><span class="linenos"></span></a><span class="o">{</span>
<a id="line-1-4" name="line-1-4"></a><a href="#line-1-4"><span class="linenos"></span></a><span class="w">    </span><span class="s2">&quot;is_ok&quot;</span>:<span class="w"> </span>true,
<a id="line-1-5" name="line-1-5"></a><a href="#line-1-5"><span class="linenos"></span></a><span class="w">    </span><span class="s2">&quot;cid&quot;</span>:<span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;27406f29c66c2ab6296bc0c0&quot;</span>,
<a id="line-1-6" name="line-1-6"></a><a href="#line-1-6"><span class="linenos"></span></a><span class="w">    </span><span class="s2">&quot;stdout&quot;</span>:<span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot; 09:45:42 up 37 min,  1 user,  load average: 0.14, 0.27, 0.18\n&quot;</span><span class="o">}</span>
<a id="line-1-7" name="line-1-7"></a><a href="#line-1-7"><span class="linenos"></span></a>$
</code></pre></div>
Note that, at this stage, the service should be used in trusted environments only, e.g. it will run any command that it is given
on input which means that in the next iteration it could be changed to only allow commands from an allow-list, rejecting
anything that is not recognized.</p>
<p>And this completes it - the service is deployed and made accessible via a REST channel that can be invoked using JSON.
Any command can be sent to any host and their output will be returned to API callers in JSON responses.</p>

<p>Wing 10 and earlier versions are not affected by installation of Wing 11 and
may be installed and used independently. However, project files for Wing 10
and earlier are converted when opened by Wing 11 and should be saved under a
new name, since Wing 11 projects cannot be opened by older versions of Wing.</p>
<h2><img src="https://wingware.com/images/wing18.png" /> New in Wing 11</h2><h3>Improved AI Assisted Development</h3><p>Wing 11 improves the user interface for AI assisted development by introducing two separate
tools <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span> <span class="pre">Coder</span></tt> and <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span> <span class="pre">Chat</span></tt>. <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span> <span class="pre">Coder</span></tt> can be used to write, redesign, or extend code
in the current editor. <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span> <span class="pre">Chat</span></tt> can be used to ask about code or iterate in creating a
design or new code without directly modifying the code in an editor.</p>
<p>Wing 11's AI assisted development features now support not just OpenAI but also Claude, Grok,
Gemini, Perplexity, Mistral, Deepseek, and any other OpenAI completions API compatible AI provider.</p>
<p>This release also improves setting up AI request context, so that both automatically and
manually selected and described context items may be paired with an AI request. AI request
contexts can now be stored, optionally so they are shared by all projects, and may be used
independently with different AI features.</p>
<p>AI requests can now also be stored in the current project or shared with all projects, and Wing
comes preconfigured with a set of commonly used requests. In addition to changing code in the
current editor, stored requests may create a new untitled file or run instead in AI Chat. Wing
11 also introduces options for changing code within an editor, including replacing code,
commenting out code, or starting a diff/merge session to either accept or reject changes.</p>
<p>Wing 11 also supports using AI to generate commit messages based on the changes being committed
to a revision control system.</p>
<p>You can now also configure multiple AI providers for easier access to different models.</p>
<p>For details see <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span> <span class="pre">Assisted</span> <span class="pre">Development</span></tt> under <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Wing</span> <span class="pre">Manual</span></tt> in Wing 11's <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Help</span></tt> menu.</p>
<h3>Package Management with uv </h3><p>Wing Pro 11 adds support for the <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">uv</span></tt> package manager in the New Project dialog and the
Packages tool.</p>

<h3>Improved Python Code Analysis</h3><p>Wing 11 makes substantial improvements to Python code analysis, with better support for
literals such as dicts and sets, parametrized type aliases, <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">typing.Self</span></tt>, type of
variables on the <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">def</span></tt> or <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">class</span></tt> line that declares them, generic classes with
<tt class="literal"><span class="pre">[...]</span></tt>, <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">__all__</span></tt> in <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">*.pyi</span></tt> files, subscripts in <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">typing.Type</span></tt> and similar, type
aliases, type hints in strings, <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">type[...]</span></tt> and <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">tuple[...]</span></tt>,
<tt class="literal"><span class="pre">&#64;functools.cached_property</span></tt>, base classes found also in <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">.pyi</span></tt> files, and
<tt class="literal"><span class="pre">typing.Literal[...]</span></tt>.</p>
<h3>Updated Localizations</h3><p>Wing 11 updates the German, French, and Russian localizations, and introduces a new experimental
AI-generated Spanish localization. The Spanish localization and the new AI-generated strings in the
French and Russian localizations may be accessed with the new <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">User</span> <span class="pre">Interface</span> <span class="pre">&gt;</span> <span class="pre">Include</span> <span class="pre">AI</span>
<span class="pre">Translated</span> <span class="pre">Strings</span></tt> preference.</p>
<h3>Improved diff/merge</h3><p>Wing Pro 11 adds floating buttons directly between the editors to make navigating differences
and merging easier, allows undoing previously merged changes, and does a better job managing
scratch buffers, scroll locking, and sizing of merged ranges.</p>
<p>For details see <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Difference</span> <span class="pre">and</span> <span class="pre">Merge</span></tt> under <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Wing</span> <span class="pre">Manual</span></tt> in Wing 11's <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Help</span></tt> menu.</p>
<h3>Other Minor Features and Improvements</h3><p>Wing 11 also adds support for Python 3.14, improves the custom key binding assignment user
interface, adds a <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Files</span> <span class="pre">&gt;</span> <span class="pre">Auto-Save</span> <span class="pre">Files</span> <span class="pre">When</span> <span class="pre">Wing</span> <span class="pre">Loses</span> <span class="pre">Focus</span></tt> preference, warns
immediately when opening a project with an invalid Python Executable configuration, allows
clearing recent menus, expands the set of available special environment variables for
project configuration, and makes a number of other bug fixes and usability improvements.</p>
<h3>Changes and Incompatibilities</h3><p>Since Wing 11 replaced the <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span></tt> tool with <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span> <span class="pre">Coder</span></tt> and <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span> <span class="pre">Chat</span></tt>, and AI
configuration is completely different than in Wing 10, you will need to reconfigure your
AI integration manually in Wing 11. This is done with <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Manage</span> <span class="pre">AI</span> <span class="pre">Providers</span></tt> in the
<tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span></tt> menu. After adding the first provider configuration, Wing will set that provider as
the default. You can switch between providers with <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Switch</span> <span class="pre">to</span> <span class="pre">Provider</span></tt> in the <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span></tt> menu.</p>

            <p>Python has supported type hinting for quite a few versions now, starting way back in 3.5. However, Python itself does not enforce type checking. Instead, you need to use an external tool or IDE. The first and arguably most popular is mypy. Microsoft also has a Python type checker that you can use in VS Code [&#8230;]</p>

<p>Py (daughter) is now 11 years old, and she spends a lot of time on Scratch,
makes beautiful and fun things. But, she thinks she is not a programmer as she
is moving blocks and not typing code like us. I had questions for long time
about how to move this Scratch generation into programming in general via
Python. <a href="https://ektupy.org">EktuPy</a> is my probable solution.</p>
<p><img alt="Home page" src="https://kushaldas.in/images/ektupy/homepage01.png" /></p>
<p>In simple words, we have an editor to write code in the left, and a Canvas/stage on the left.
You can do all the similar things you do on scratch here, I have a list of examples in the editor.</p>
<p><img alt="Hello World" src="https://kushaldas.in/images/ektupy/helloworld.png" /></p>
<p>We use <a href="https://pyscript.net/">PyScript</a> and thanks to
<a href="https://astral.sh">Astral</a> we have both <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/">Ruff</a>
and <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ty/">ty</a> for LSP/linting support in the editor
(using webassembly). The whole code is executing on the browser of the user.</p>
<p><img alt="Drawing via keyboard" src="https://kushaldas.in/images/ektupy/drawing_withkeyboard.png" /></p>
<p><img alt="Drawing via pen" src="https://kushaldas.in/images/ektupy/drawing_pen.png" /></p>
<p><img alt="Pong" src="https://kushaldas.in/images/ektupy/pong.png" /></p>
<p>Yesterday I took part in the monthly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Bp_VXowFv4">PyScript Fun call</a>
because <a href="https://ntoll.org">Nicholas</a> reminded me, had fun to demonstrate it
there and watched what others are building.</p>
<p><img alt="Two Sprites" src="https://kushaldas.in/images/ektupy/two_sprites.png" /></p>
<p>The first time Py pocked around for 1:30 hours, she gave me 11 bugs, and next
for 5 minutes and asked me to get tutorials, she did not want to read the
<a href="https://docs.ektupy.org">documentation</a>. So, for every example in the editor
we have tutorials, not too detailed yet, but good enough to start.</p>
<p><img alt="Tutorial" src="https://kushaldas.in/images/ektupy/tutorial.png" /></p>
<p>You can create an account and save your programs. You can share them as public
from your dashboard, then others can find those in the
<a href="https://beta.ektupy.org/explore/">explorepage</a> and run the code or remix if they want.</p>
<p><img alt="Space shooter" src="https://kushaldas.in/images/ektupy/space_shooter.png" /></p>
<p>I am super nostalgic about <a href="https://beta.ektupy.org/share/8d5bb6a3ecf594cfb9e168ae7f9091b9/">one implementation</a> :)</p>
<p>Oh, because I think kids may not have to learn about <code>async</code> programming in this
platform, calls like <code>wait()</code> or <code>ask()</code> or <code>play_sound_until_done()</code> or
<code>wait_until()</code> are all synchronous for the edtior, and then some AST
transformer adds the <code>async/await</code> as needed. </p>
<p>Feel free to try this out, share the link to your kid or teachers/parents you
know. Let me know how to improve. I will publish the codebase, a
<a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> application with proper license and
hopefully we can make it even better togather.</p>
<p>This project was not possible without all the work done before, including
Scratch, or <a href="https://codemirror.net/">CodeMirror</a> for the edtior,
<a href="https://pyscript.net/">PyScript</a> / <a href="https://pyodide.org/en/stable/">PyOdide</a>,
the bigger Python community and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_(language_model)">Claude/Opus4.5</a> for
incredicable TypeScript/Javascript help :)</p>

            <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>As a consultant constantly working with clients, I found myself in a familiar predicament: my head was always down, focused on delivering value to customers, but my own infrastructure monitoring was non-existent. I had no simple way to track SSL/TLS certificate expirations across the multiple domains I managed - personal sites, client projects, and community services.</p>
<p>I needed a solution, but I had several constraints:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>No time for complex setup</strong>: I couldn&rsquo;t afford to spend days installing, configuring, and deploying yet another monitoring service</li>
<li><strong>Easy maintenance</strong>: Whatever I built had to be low-maintenance - I didn&rsquo;t want another system to babysit</li>
<li><strong>Transparency and control</strong>: I wanted a simple text file in Git listing the hosts to monitor, so I could see exactly what was being checked and track changes over time</li>
<li><strong>Zero infrastructure</strong>: No servers to provision, patch, or pay for</li>
</ol>
<p>Around this time, a friend named Julien shared his project called <code>certificate_watcher</code>, a lightweight Python tool for checking SSL certificate expiration. I contributed a few patches (if memory serves), and it clicked: what if I could combine this with GitHub Actions and Slack notifications?</p>

            <p>When you implement an algorithm, you also implement tests to make sure the outputs are correct.
This can help you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ensure your code is correct.</li>
  <li>Catch problems if and when you change it in the future.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re trying to make sure your software is fast, or at least doesn’t get slower, automated tests for performance would also be useful.
But where should you start?</p>

<p>My suggestion: start by testing big-O scaling.
It’s a critical aspect of your software’s speed, and it doesn’t require a complex benchmarking setup.
In this article I’ll cover:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A reminder of what big-O scaling means for algorithms.</li>
  <li>Why this is such a critical performance property.</li>
  <li>Identifying your algorithm’s scalability, including empirically with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bigO</code> library.</li>
  <li>Using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bigO</code> library to test your Python code’s big-O scalability.</li>
</ul>

<p>Or worse: you configured a cloud SMTP server for testing, forgot to disable actual sending, and now your Mailgun account is suspended for &ldquo;suspicious activity&rdquo; because you sent 847 emails to <code>test@example.com</code> in 5 minutes.</p>

<p>After <a href="https://kushaldas.in/2005.html">2005</a> again in <a href="https://kushaldas.in/2025.html">2025</a> I wrote only 8 blog posts.
The year was difficult in many different ways. But, from September things
became a bit better. I could not do a lot of things which I thought I would do,
or rather I promised to do.</p>
<p>I hoping to catch up on those promises in the coming months. That not only
includes blog posts on vairous things I am writing/building, but also I have a
huge backlog of photos to work on and publish.</p>
