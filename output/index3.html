            <p>Regular readers of this blog will know that I started a new company.  We have
put out just a <a href="https://earendil.com/purpose/">tiny bit of information today</a>,
and some keen folks have discovered and reached out by email with many
thoughtful responses.  It has been delightful.</p>
<p><a href="https://colin.day/">Colin</a> and I met here, in Vienna.  We started sharing
coffees, ideas, and lunches, and soon found shared values despite coming from
different backgrounds and different parts of the world.  We are excited about
the future, but we&#8217;re equally vigilant of it.  After traveling together a bit,
we decided to plunge into the cold water and start a company together.  We want
to be successful, but we want to do it the right way and we want to be able to
demonstrate that to our kids.</p>
<p>Vienna is a city of great history, two million inhabitants and a fascinating
vibe that is nothing like San Francisco.  In fact, Vienna is in many ways the
polar opposite to the Silicon Valley, both in mindset, in opportunity and
approach to life.  Colin comes from San Francisco, and though I&#8217;m Austrian, my
career has been shaped by years working with California companies and people
from there who used my Open Source software.  Vienna is now our shared home.
Despite Austria being so far away from California, it is a place of tinkerers
and troublemakers.  It&#8217;s always good to remind oneself that society consists of
more than just your little bubble.  It also creates the necessary counter
balance to think in these times.</p>
<p>The world that is emerging in front of our eyes is one of change.  We
incorporated as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benefit_corporation">PBC</a> with
a founding charter to craft software and open protocols, strengthen human
agency, bridge division and ignorance and to cultivate lasting joy and
understanding.  Things we believe in deeply.</p>
<p>I have dedicated 20 years of my life in one way or another creating Open Source
software.  In the same way as artificial intelligence calls into question the
very nature of my profession and the way we build software, the present day
circumstances are testing society.  We&#8217;re not immune to
these changes and we&#8217;re navigating them like everyone else, with a mixture of
excitement and worry.  But we share a belief that right now is the time to stand
true to one&#8217;s values and principles.  We want to take an earnest shot at leaving
the world a better place than we found it.  Rather than reject the changes that
are happening, we look to nudge them towards the right direction.</p>

            <p>Two years ago I discovered a potential foot-gun
with the Python standard library “<code>re</code>” module.
<a href="https://sethmlarson.dev/regex-%24-matches-end-of-string-or-newline">I blogged about this behavior</a>,
and turns out that
I wasn't only one who didn't know this:
The article was #1 on HackerNews and the
most-read article on my blog in 2024.
In short the unexpected behavior is that the pattern “<code>^Hello$</code>” matches both “<code>Hello</code>” and “<code>Hello\n</code>”,
and sometimes you don't intend to match a trailing newline.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>This article serves as a follow-up!
Back in 2024
<a href="https://sethmlarson.dev/regex-%24-matches-end-of-string-or-newline#:~:text=Pattern matches">I created a table</a> showing that <code>\z</code> was a partially viable
alternative to <code>$</code> for matching end-of-string
without matching a trailing newline... for every regular expression
implementation <strong>EXCEPT</strong> Python and EMCAScript. </p>

<p>But that is no longer true, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.14.html#re">Python 3.14</a> now supports <code>\z</code>! This means <code>\z</code> is <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/133306">one step closer</a>
to being the universal recommendation to match
the end of string without matching a newline.
Obviously no one is upgrading their Python
version just for this new feature, but it's good to know that
the gap is being closed. Thanks to David Wheeler
for doing deeper research in the <a href="https://best.openssf.org">OpenSSF Best Practices
WG</a> and <a href="https://best.openssf.org/Correctly-Using-Regular-Expressions">publishing this report</a>.</p>

<p>Until Python 3.13 is deprecated and long gone: using <code>\Z</code> (as an alias for <code>\z</code>) works fine for Python regular expressions.
Just note that this behavior isn't the same <a href="https://best.openssf.org/Correctly-Using-Regular-Expressions#guidance">across regular expression
implementations</a>, for example EMCAScript, Golang, and Rust
don't support <code>\Z</code> and for PHP, Java, and .NET <code>\Z</code> <em>actually
matches trailing newlines!</em></p>

            <p>This year marks the ninth iteration of the official Python Developers Survey. We intentionally launched the survey in January (later than years prior) so that data collection and results can be completed and shared within the same calendar year. The survey aims to capture the current state of the Python language and its surrounding ecosystem. By comparing the results with last year’s, the community can identify emerging trends and gain deeper insight into how Python continues to evolve.<br /><br />We encourage you to contribute to our community’s knowledge by sharing your experience and perspective. Your participation is valued! The survey should only take you about 10-15 minutes to complete.&nbsp;<br /><br /><a href="https://surveys.jetbrains.com/s3/python-developers-survey-2026" target="_blank">Contribute to the Python Developers Survey 2026!</a><br /><br />This year we aim to reach even more of our community and ensure accurate global representation by highlighting our localization efforts:&nbsp;<br /></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>The survey is translated into Chinese, French, German, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish.&nbsp;</li><li>To assist individuals in promoting the survey and encouraging their local communities and professional networks we have created a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C3r-dFY5LmklzCnf72vfeehzRqCCDuXzK8xKuwBES1Y/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Promotion Kit</a> with images and social media posts translated into a variety of languages. We hope this promotion kit empowers folks to spread the invitation to respond to the survey within their local communities.</li><li>We’d love it if you’d share one or more of the posts in the Promotion Kit to your social media or any community accounts you manage, as well as share the information in Python related discords, mailing lists, or chats you participate in.</li><li>If you would like to help out with translations you see are missing, please request edit access to the doc and share what language you will be translating to. Translations for promotions into languages the survey may not be translated to is also welcome!&nbsp;</li></ul><p>If you have ideas about what else we can do to get the word out and encourage a diversity of responses, please comment on <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/your-python-your-voice-join-the-python-developers-survey-2026/105883" target="_blank">the corresponding Discuss thread</a>.&nbsp;<br /><br />The survey is organized in partnership between the <a href="https://www.python.org/psf-landing/" target="_blank">Python Software Foundation</a> and <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/" target="_blank">JetBrains</a>. After the survey is over, JetBrains will publish the aggregated results and randomly choose 20 winners (among those who complete the survey in its entirety), who will each receive a $100 Amazon Gift Card or a local equivalent.<br /><br /></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/kushaldas/replyfast">replyfast</a> is a Python module to receive and send messages on <a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a>.</p>
<p>You can install it via </p>
<p><code>python3 -m pip install replyfast</code> </p>
<p>or </p>
<p><code>uv pip install replyfast</code> </p>
<p>I have to add Windows builds to CI though.</p>
<p>I have a <a href="https://github.com/kushaldas/replyfast/blob/main/register.py">script</a> to help you to register as a device, and
then you can send and receive messages.</p>
<p>I have a <a href="https://github.com/kushaldas/replyfast/blob/main/examples/demo_bot.py">demo bot</a> which shows both sending and rreceiving messages, and also how to schedule work following the <code>crontab</code> syntaxt.</p>
<pre><code class="language-Python">    scheduler.register(
        &quot;*/5 * * * *&quot;,
        send_disk_usage,
        args=(client,),
        name=&quot;disk-usage&quot;,
    )
</code></pre>
<p>This is all possible due to the <a href="https://github.com/whisperfish/presage">presage</a> library written in Rust.</p>
          </p>

<a href="https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/how-to/assert.html#assertions-about-expected-exceptions" rel="external noopener"><code>pytest.raises</code></a> as a context manager, and have
separate tests for the cases that succeed and those that fail.  Instead, this

</blockquote><p>One parameterized test that covers both good and bad outcomes. Nice.</p><h1 id="h_antilru">AntiLRU<a class="headerlink" href="#h_antilru"></a></h1><p>The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.lru_cache" rel="external noopener"><code>@functools.lru_cache</code></a> decorator (and its
convenience cousin <code>@cache</code>) are good ways to save the result of a function
so that you don&#8217;t have to compute it repeatedly.  But, they hide an implicit
global in your program: the dictionary of cached results.</p><p>This can interfere with testing. Your tests should all be isolated from each
other. You don&#8217;t want a side effect of one test to affect the outcome of another
test. The hidden global dictionary will do just that. The first test calls the
cached function, then the second test gets the cached value, not a newly
computed one.</p><p>Ideally, lru_cache would only be used on <em>pure</em> functions: the result only depends on the arguments.
If it&#8217;s only used for pure functions, then you don&#8217;t need to worry about interactions between tests
because the answer will be the same for the second test anyway.</p><p>But lru_cache is used on functions that pull information from the
environment, perhaps from a network API call.  The tests might mock out the API
to check the behavior under different API circumstances. Here&#8217;s where the
interference is a real problem.</p><p>The lru_cache decorator makes a <code>.clear_cache</code> method available on each
decorated function. I had some code that explicitly called that method on the
cached functions. But then I added a new cached function, forgot to update the
conftest.py code that cleared the caches, and my tests were failing.</p><p>A more convenient approach is provided by
<a href="https://pypi.org/project/pytest-antilru/" rel="external noopener">pytest-antilru</a>: it&#8217;s a pytest plugin that monkeypatches
<code>@lru_cache</code> to track all of the cached functions, and clears them all
between tests. The caches are still in effect during each test, but can&#8217;t
interfere between them.</p><p>It works great. I was able to get rid of all of the manually maintained cache
clearing in my conftest.py.</p>

            Building on the web is like working with the perfect clay. It’s malleable and can become almost anything. But too often, frameworks try to hide the web’s best parts away from us. Today, we’re looking at PyView, a project that brings the real-time power of Phoenix LiveView directly into the Python world. I'm joined by Larry Ogrodnek to dive into PyView.

            <p>السر يكمن في “السرعة بدون فأرة” (Mouse-free Speed).</p>

<p><strong>Vim</strong> ليس مجرد محرر نصوص، هو <em>لغة</em> لتحرير النصوص.
بدلاً من أن تمسك الفأرة وتحدد سطراً لتحذفه، تضغط <code class="highlighter-rouge">dd</code>. لتغيير كلمة داخل قوسين، تضغط <code class="highlighter-rouge">ci"</code>.
بمجرد أن تتعود على هذه الاختصارات (Muscle Memory)، يصبح التعديل بسرعة تفكيرك.</p>

<p><strong>لكن…</strong>
VS Code هو بيئة تطوير متكاملة (IDE) رائعة جداً، وحديثة، وسهلة.

            <p>سؤال ممتاز! الفرق الأساسي يكمن في كيفية تعامل كل منهما مع <code class="highlighter-rouge">this</code> keyword.</p>

<p>في <strong>الدوال العادية</strong> (Regular Functions)، تتغير قيمة <code class="highlighter-rouge">this</code> بناءً على كيفية استدعاء الدالة:</p>

<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">regular</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">this</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">// يعتمد على من نادى الدالة</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>أما في <strong>Arrow Functions</strong>، فإن <code class="highlighter-rouge">this</code> تأخذ قيمتها من السياق المحيط وقت التعريف (Lexical Scope) ولا تتغير أبداً:</p>

<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">const</span> <span class="nx">arrow</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">()</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">this</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">// يرث القيمة من الأب</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>لهذا السبب نستخدم الـ Arrow Functions كثيراً في React داخل الـ Callbacks لنتجنب مشاكل <code class="highlighter-rouge">bind(this)</code>.</p>

            <p>We are thrilled to announce that Djangonaut Space, a mentorship program for contributing to Django, is <a href="https://djangonaut.space/sessions/2026-session-6/">open for applicants for our next cohort!</a> 🚀</p>
<p>Djangonaut Space is holding a sixth session! This session will start on March 2nd, 2026. We are currently accepting applications until <strong>February 2nd, 2026 Anywhere on Earth</strong>. More details can be found in the <a href="https://djangonaut.space/comms/2026/01/18/2026-opening-session-6/">website</a>.</p>
<p>Djangonaut Space is a free, 8-week group mentoring program where individuals will work self-paced in a semi-structured learning environment. It seeks to help members of the community who wish to level up their current Django code contributions and potentially take on leadership roles in Django in the future.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I'm so grateful to have been a part of the Djangonaut Space program. It's a wonderfully warm, diverse, and welcoming space, and the perfect place to get started with Django contributions. The community is full of bright, talented individuals who are making time to help and guide others, which is truly a joy to experience. Before Djangonaut Space, I felt as though I wasn't the kind of person who could become a Django contributor; now I feel like I found a place where I belong.” - Eliana, Djangonaut Session 1</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Enthusiastic about contributing to Django but wondering what we have in store for you? No worries, we have got you covered! 🤝</p>

<p>After <a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2021/04/24/mgba-and-dolphin-connectivity/">reading the documentation</a> to connect the two emulators I configured the
controllers to be “GBA (TCP)” in Dolphin and ensured that Dolphin had the
permissions it needed to do networking (Dolphin is installed as a Flatpak).
I selected “Connect” on mGBA from the “Connect to Dolphin” popup screen
and there was zero feedback... no UI changes, errors, or success messages. Hmmm...</p>

<p>I found out in a random Reddit comment section that a GBA BIOS was needed to connect to Dolphin, so I set off
to legally obtain the BIOSes from my hardware.
I opted to use the <a href="https://github.com/mgba-emu/bios-dump">BIOS-dump ROM</a> developed by the mGBA team
to dump the BIOS from my Game Boy Advance SP and DS Lite.</p>

<p>Below is a guide on how to <a href="https://github.com/mgba-emu/bios-dump">build the BIOS ROM from source</a>
on Ubuntu 24.04, and then dump GBA BIOSes. Please note you'll likely need a GBA flash cartridge
for running homebrew on your Game Boy Advance. I used
an EZ-Flash Omega flash cartridge, but I've heard Everdrive GBA is also popular.</p>

<h2>Installing devKitARM on Ubuntu 24.04</h2>

<p>To build this ROM from source you'll need <a href="https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started">devKitARM</a>.
If you already have devKitARM installed you can skip these steps.
The devKitPro team supplies an <a href="https://apt.devkitpro.org/install-devkitpro-pacman">easy script</a> for installing
devKitPro toolsets, but unfortunately the <code>apt.devkitpro.org</code> domain
appears to be behind an aggressive “bot” filter right now
so their instructions to use <code>wget</code> are not working as written.</p>

<p>Instead, download <a href="https://apt.devkitpro.org/devkitpro-pub.gpg">their GPG key</a>
with a browser and then run the commands yourself:</p>

<div class="codehilite">
<pre><span></span><code>apt-get install apt-transport-https

<span class="k">if</span> ! <span class="o">[</span> -f /usr/local/share/keyring/devkitpro-pub.gpg <span class="o">]</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">then</span>
  mkdir -p /usr/local/share/keyring/
  mv devkitpro-pub.gpg /usr/local/share/keyring/
<span class="k">fi</span>

<span class="k">if</span> ! <span class="o">[</span> -f /etc/apt/sources.list.d/devkitpro.list <span class="o">]</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">then</span>
  <span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;deb [signed-by=/usr/local/share/keyring/devkitpro-pub.gpg] https://apt.devkitpro.org stable main&quot;</span> &gt; /etc/apt/sources.list.d/devkitpro.list
<span class="k">fi</span>

apt-get update
apt-get install devkitpro-pacman
</code></pre>

<p>Once you've installed devKitPro pacman (for Ubuntu: <code>dkp-pacman</code>)
you can install the GBA development tools package group:</p>

<div class="codehilite">
<pre><span></span><code>dkp-pacman -S gba-dev
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>After this you can set the <code>DEVKITARM</code> environment variable
within your shell profile to <code>/opt/devkitpro/devkitARM</code>.
Now you should be ready to build the GBA BIOS dumping ROM.</p>

<h2>Building the bios-dump ROM</h2>

<p>Once devKitARM toolkit is installed the next step is much easier.
You basically download the source, run <code>make</code> with the <code>DEVKITARM</code> environment variable
set properly, and if all the tools are installed you'll quickly have
your ROM:</p>

<div class="codehilite">
<pre><span></span><code>apt-get install build-essential curl unzip
curl -L -o bios-dump.zip <span class="se">\</span>
    https://github.com/mgba-emu/bios-dump/archive/refs/heads/master.zip
unzip bios-dump.zip
<span class="nb">cd</span> bios-dump-master
<span class="nb">export</span> <span class="nv">DEVKITARM</span><span class="o">=</span>/opt/devkitpro/devkitARM/
make
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You should end up with a GBA ROM file titled <code>bios-dump.gba</code>.
Add this <code>.gba</code> file to your microSD card for the flash cartridge.
Boot up the flash cartridge using the device you are trying to dump
BIOS of and after boot-up the screen should quickly show a success message
along with checksums of the BIOS file. As noted in the mGBA bios-dump README, there are two GBA BIOSes:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>sha256:fd2547</code>: GBA, GBA SP, GBA SP “AGS-101”, GBA Micro, and Game Boy Player.</li>
<li><code>sha256:782eb3</code>: DS, DS Lite, and all 3DS variants</li>
</ul>

<p>I own a GBA SP, a Game Boy Player, and a DS Lite, so I was able to 
dump three different GBA BIOSes, two of which are identical:</p>

<div class="codehilite">
<pre><span></span><code>sha256sum *.bin
fd2547...  gba_sp_bios.bin
fd2547...  gba_gbp_bios.bin
782eb3...  gba_ds_bios.bin
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>From here I was able to configure mGBA with a GBA BIOS file (Tools→Settings→BIOS)
and successfully connect to Dolphin running four instances of mGBA; one for each
of the Links!</p>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-8">
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/sethmlarson-dev-static-assets/G4SE01_2026-01-17_17-11-00.png" style="border: 2px solid black;" /></p>

<div class="col-4">
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/sethmlarson-dev-static-assets/gba_bios-0.png" style="border: 2px solid black;" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">💚❤️💙💜</p>
<p>mGBA probably could have shown an error message
when the “connecting” phase requires a BIOS.
Looks like this behavior been known <a href="https://github.com/mgba-emu/mgba/issues/2210">since 2021</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://volochii.dev/blog/urllib3-in-2025/">2025 was a big year for urllib3</a> and I want you to read about it!
In case you missed it, this year I <a href="https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/3629">passed the baton of
“lead maintainer”</a> to <a href="https://volochii.dev">Illia Volochii</a> who has a <a href="https://volochii.dev">new website and blog</a>.
<a href="https://quentin.pradet.me/">Quentin Pradet</a> and I continue to be maintainers to the project.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>If you are reading my blog to keep up-to-date on the latest in urllib3
I highly recommend following both <a href="https://volochii.dev/blog/">Illia</a> and <a href="https://quentin.pradet.me/blog/">Quentin's</a> blogs, as I will
likely publish less and less about urllib3 here going forward.
The leadership change was a part of <a href="https://sethmlarson.dev/observing-volunteer-amnesty-day">my observation</a> of <a href="https://www.volunteeramnestyday.net/">Volunteer Responsibility Amnesty Day</a>
in the spring of last year.</p>

<p>This isn't goodbye, but I would like to take a moment to be reflective. Being a contributor to urllib3 from 2016 to now has had
an incredibly positive impact on my life and livelihood. I am forever grateful for my early open source mentors: <a href="https://lukasa.co.uk/">Cory Benfield</a> and <a href="https://blog.thea.codes/">Thea "Stargirl" Flowers</a>,
who were urllib3 leads before me. I've also met <em>so many new friends</em> from my deep involvement with Python open source,
it really is an amazing network of people! 💜</p>

<p>urllib3 was <a href="https://sethmlarson.dev/review-of-2019-for-urllib3#grants-and-sponsorships">my first opportunity to work on open source full-time</a> for a few
weeks on a grant about improving security.
urllib3 became an early partner with <a href="https://tidelift.com">Tidelift</a>,
leading me to investigate and write about open source security practices and policies
for Python projects.
My positions at Elastic and
the Python Software Foundation were likely influenced by my involvement with urllib3
and other open source Python projects.</p>

<p>In short: contributing to open source is an amazing and potentially life-changing opportunity.</p>
