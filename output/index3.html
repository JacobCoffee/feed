            <p>A few years ago at work, I had a project which offered an opportunity to look at the new generation of async-first, type-hint-driven Python web frameworks. For reasons which aren’t particularly relevant today, on that project I ended up choosing <a href="https://litestar.dev">Litestar</a>, which is the one that <em>doesn’t</em> have a ravenous all-consuming hype machine surrounding it. And I’m very glad I did, because today I’m more convinced than ever it was the right choice, and for the last 18 months or so every new project I’ve started at my day job has been built with&nbsp;Litestar.</p>
<p>But even if you’re someone who does Python web apps for a living, and even if you’re someone who builds asynchronous type-hint-driven web apps, you might not be familiar with this absolute gem of the Python web ecosystem, and today I want to remedy&nbsp;that.</p>
<h2>A&nbsp;taste</h2>
<p>Here’s the traditional single-file-app&nbsp;demo:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kn">from</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nn">litestar</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">Litestar</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">get</span>


<span class="nd">@get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;/greet&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">async</span> <span class="k">def</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nf">greet</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="sa">f</span><span class="s2">&quot;Hi, </span><span class="si">{</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">!&quot;</span>


<span class="n">app</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Litestar</span><span class="p">([</span><span class="n">greet</span><span class="p">])</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>You save this&nbsp;as <code>app.py</code>, run&nbsp;with <code>litestar run</code> or hand it directly to the <abbr title="Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface"><span class="caps">ASGI</span></abbr> server of your choice, and it launches a web application. You go&nbsp;to <code>/greet?name=Bob</code> and it replies “Hi, Bob!”. Leave out&nbsp;the <code>name</code> parameter and it responds with an <span class="caps">HTTP</span> 400 telling you&nbsp;the <code>name</code> parameter is&nbsp;required.</p>
<p>So what. Big deal. The FastAPI Evangelism Strike Force will be along soon to bury you under rocket-ship emoji while explaining that FastAPI does the same thing but a million times better. And if you’re a Java person used to Spring, or a .<span class="caps">NET</span>  person used to <span class="caps">ASP</span>.<span class="caps">NET</span> <span class="caps">MVC</span>, well, there’s nothing here that’s new to you; you’ve had this style of annotation/signature-driven framework for years (and in fact one thing I like about Litestar is how often it reminds me of the good parts of those frameworks). And did anyone tell you FastAPI does this, too!&nbsp;🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀</p>
<p>But there are a lot of things that make Litestar stand out to me in the Python world. I’m going to pick out three to talk about today, and one of them is hiding in plain sight in that simple example&nbsp;application.</p>
<div class="alert alert-warning">
<p><strong>What’s in a&nbsp;name?</strong></p>
<p>You might see older material referring to Litestar as “Starlite”, which was its original&nbsp;name.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.starlette.io">Starlette</a> is a toolkit for doing async Python web development, which can be used standalone or as a component in a more complex library or framework. FastAPI still uses Starlette under the hood, for example. And Litestar originally was built on Starlette too, and was named “Starlite”, presumably in recognition of that. Over time, though, it dropped the Starlette dependency in favor of its own implementations for that functionality, and people on social media complained that the “Starlite” name was confusing, especially since Star<em>lette</em> was no longer being used. So the project which had been “Starlite” was renamed to Litestar for version 2.0, released in 2023, and has had that name ever&nbsp;since.</p>
</div>
<h3>Scaling (the other&nbsp;kind)</h3>
<p>It’s a bit unfortunate that the term “scaling” is almost always assumed to mean handling larger and larger quantities of traffic, because that’s only one axis on which any given piece of of technology can “scale” (and, I’d argue, possibly the least important one). The type of scaling I want to talk about here is scaling of a codebase: how does something (in this case, a web framework) help or hinder you as you deal with different amounts of&nbsp;code?</p>
<p>Django, for example, has a reputation for not scaling “down” all that well. You <em>can</em> do it if you really want to, and every so often someone will come up with a new demo of doing a Django project in a single Python file, but it’s just not something that comes naturally to Django. Quite the opposite: if you work through the official beginner Django tutorial and do things the &#8220;Django way&#8221;, you’ll have around a dozen files laid out in a specific structure of directories and subdirectories before you’ve written a single meaningful line of your own&nbsp;code. </p>
<p>But “micro” frameworks have often had the opposite problem: they’re great at starting out with a tiny single-file application, and then get painful as your codebase grows and needs to spread out (single-file Django approaches have the same problem: you have to do a lot of work to get a “micro-Django” working, and then you have to <em>undo</em> all that work as soon as the code grows large enough to be worth splitting across multiple&nbsp;files).</p>
<p>Let’s look at an example. Here’s a FastAPI equivalent of the basic Litestar application I showed&nbsp;above:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kn">from</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nn">fastapi</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">FastAPI</span>


<span class="n">app</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">FastAPI</span><span class="p">()</span>

<span class="nd">@app</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;/greet&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">async</span> <span class="k">def</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nf">greet</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="sa">f</span><span class="s2">&quot;Hello, </span><span class="si">{</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">!&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Notice that&nbsp;the <code>get()</code> decorator here is attached to the application object. This is a common pattern (Flask/Quart do the same thing, for example, and Starlette used to but has deprecated its entire decorator-based routing system), but it creates a problem once you have multiple files. You need to import the main application object into the other files in order to decorate the routes, but you need to import the other files into your “main” application file to make sure the route registrations are visible from there, and now you have a circular import, and that doesn’t&nbsp;work.</p>
<p>The general solution these frameworks offer is some sort of alternative sub-application object which can act as a per-file route registry that’s safe to import into the file where your application object is defined. FastAPI calls this object an “<span class="caps">API</span> router”; Flask/Quart call it a “blueprint”. Either way, it’s a necessary construct for those frameworks because their route decorators are always bound to some parent object, either the application object in a single-file app or an “<span class="caps">API</span> router”/“blueprint”/etc. object in a multi-file&nbsp;app.</p>
<p>That solves the circular-import problem, but creates a new issue: the whiz-bang quickstart demos of “micro” frameworks generally register all the example routes on the application object in a single file in order to keep everything as simple and flashy as possible, but now in order to build a real application (which will almost never stay in a single file) you’ll need to use a different mechanism, or start out following the demo and then switch later on. You also have to <em>know</em> about that different mechanism; in one framework’s documentation that I looked at, you can (at the time I&#8217;m writing this post) apparently get 40 pages into the user guide before encountering the section on how to register routes in a multi-file app&nbsp;😖😖😖.</p>
<p>Litestar avoids this entire mess by having the route decorators be standalone functions, not bound to a parent application or application-like object. This may seem like a small thing to focus on, but if you’ve spent time with popular Python microframeworks you’ve probably had to deal with the transition from single- to multi-file&nbsp;applications.</p>
<p>More importantly, this small change in approach frees up Litestar’s documentation to introduce route-grouping constructs early on and to present them as part of <a href="https://docs.litestar.dev/latest/usage/applications.html#layered-architecture">a coherent layered architecture/configuration concept</a> rather than as an escape hatch for avoiding circular imports. Which is great, because Litestar’s layered architecture is one of its best features: its grouping constructs, and their ability to share configuration, offer an elegant way to compose functionality. For example, a common pattern I use when writing a set of <abbr title="Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete"><span class="caps">CRUD</span></abbr> endpoints looks like&nbsp;this:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kn">from</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nn">litestar</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">Router</span>
<span class="kn">from</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nn">litestar.di</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">Provide</span>

<span class="c1"># Imagine some CRUD routes for widgets defined here...</span>

<span class="n">_write_widget_router</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Router</span><span class="p">(</span>
    <span class="n">guards</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">some_auth_function</span><span class="p">],</span>
    <span class="n">route_handlers</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">[</span>
        <span class="n">create_widget</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="n">delete_widget</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="n">update_widget</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="p">]</span>
<span class="p">)</span>

<span class="n">widget_router</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Router</span><span class="p">(</span>
    <span class="n">dependencies</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="s2">&quot;widget_dependency&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">Provide</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">some_widget_dependency</span><span class="p">)},</span>
    <span class="n">path</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;/widgets&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="n">route_handlers</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">[</span>
        <span class="n">get_widget</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="n">get_widget_list</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="n">_write_widget_router</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="p">]</span>
<span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This provides a single&nbsp;“public” <code>Router</code> instance with all the widget routes, all of which have access to the same core dependencies, but with the data-modifying routes also having auth applied. That composability is extremely powerful, and is less obvious if the “router” has to be introduced initially as a way to solve circular-import&nbsp;problems.</p>
<p>Litestar’s approach also means it’s easy to do things like register a single route multiple times, each with different configuration. Which enables use cases&nbsp;like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Different authentication/authorization schemes for each registration. For example, a data-editing route might be written once, and registered once under a router which applies <span class="caps">API</span> key auth for machine-to-machine requests, then registered again under a router which uses session auth for interaction by a human&nbsp;user.</li>
<li>Different sets of dependencies for each registration. For example, a route which queries and returns a list of widgets might just declare that it accepts an argument of&nbsp;type <code>WidgetRepository</code>, and leave it up to the router configuration to decide whether to dependency-inject one that sees all widgets, or perhaps only a subset, or only those which are active,&nbsp;etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you know what you’re doing, you can emulate some of this in the FastAPI/Flask style of bound route registration, but the techniques you&#8217;ll end up using for that feel to me like fighting against the framework, which is something I usually want to&nbsp;avoid.</p>
<h2>Not to be too&nbsp;Pydantic</h2>
<p><a href="https://docs.pydantic.dev/">Pydantic</a> is a popular package for defining schema objects which perform validation and serialization/deserialization, driven by Python type annotations, and one major use case for this is the input/output schemas of web applications. FastAPI appears to use Pydantic exclusively, which comes with both upsides and downsides. Pydantic is very useful and very powerful, of course, but it also means FastAPI is somewhat limited by what Pydantic can support: mostly, this is Pydantic’s own classes, and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html">the Python standard&nbsp;library’s <code>dataclasses</code></a>.</p>
<p>One crucial limitation is an inability to derive validation/serialization behavior directly from <a href="https://www.sqlalchemy.org">SQLAlchemy</a> <abbr title="Object-Relational Mapper"><span class="caps">ORM</span></abbr> classes, even though they both support a very similar type-annotation-based declaration format. Which means that to use SQLAlchemy with a Pydantic-only framework (and SQLAlchemy is basically <em>the</em> standard database toolkit and <abbr title="Object-Relational Mapper"><span class="caps">ORM</span></abbr> for Python), you either have to write out the shape of your data multiple times—once for SQLAlchemy, and then at least one more time (possibly more than one time) for Pydantic—or turn to a third-party package to help bridge the gap. FastAPI’s author worked around this by writing <a href="https://sqlmodel.tiangolo.com">a new <span class="caps">DB</span> toolkit which combines SQLAlchemy and Pydantic</a>, and pushing it in FastAPI’s&nbsp;documentation.</p>
<p>Litestar, meanwhile, <em>supports</em> Pydantic, but is not <em>tightly coupled to</em> Pydantic, which gives a bit more flexibility. By default Litestar lets you define input/output schemas using Pydantic&nbsp;models, <code>dataclasses</code>, or <a href="https://jcristharif.com/msgspec/">msgspec</a>; ships with plugins to enable the use of <a href="https://www.attrs.org/">attrs</a> and of SQLAlchemy models; and <a href="https://docs.litestar.dev/latest/usage/plugins/index.html#serializationpluginprotocol">provides a protocol for writing your own serialization plugins</a> to extend support to other kinds of&nbsp;objects.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s very convenient already, but the convenience is amplified by Litestar’s <a href="https://docs.litestar.dev/latest/usage/dto/1-abstract-dto.html">system for automatically deriving data-transfer objects</a> from data-access or domain objects. Suppose, for example, that we have the following SQLAlchemy model&nbsp;class:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kn">from</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nn">sqlalchemy.orm</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">DeclarativeBase</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">Mapped</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">mapped_column</span>

<span class="n">Base</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">DeclarativeBase</span><span class="p">()</span>

<span class="k">class</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nc">Widget</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Base</span><span class="p">):</span>

    <span class="n">sku</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">Mapped</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">mapped_column</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">unique</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="kc">True</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">name</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">Mapped</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">]</span>
    <span class="n">price_cents</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">Mapped</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nb">int</span><span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>In a Pydantic-only world, we’d need to write multiple Pydantic models representing different use&nbsp;cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>A “read” schema for use in <span class="caps">HTTP</span> responses, which would probably not include&nbsp;the <code>internal_notes</code> field and probably also&nbsp;not <code>id</code> (since <code>sku</code> is more likely to be the public&nbsp;identifier)</li>
<li>A “write” schema for creating widgets, which would&nbsp;exclude <code>id</code> since that likely is auto-generated on&nbsp;insert</li>
<li>Another “write” schema for updating widgets, setting all fields optional to allow partial&nbsp;update</li>
</ul>
<p>As well as possibly more schemas like an admin-view “read” schema that does include the internal fields, etc. Even if you get clever and use inheritance to share field definitions among all these Pydantic classes, you still will write out the full set of fields for widgets at least twice, and the second time it will be fragmented across multiple Pydantic classes, creating the risk of making a change to the <abbr title="Object-Relational Mapper"><span class="caps">ORM</span></abbr> model and forgetting to update all the corresponding field definitions in the Pydantic&nbsp;models.</p>
<p>Litestar’s approach is a significant improvement on this. For example, here’s how to use Litestar’s <abbr title="Data Transfer Object"><span class="caps">DTO</span></abbr> helpers to define the “read”&nbsp;schema:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kn">from</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nn">litestar.dto</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">DTOConfig</span>
<span class="kn">from</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nn">litestar.plugins.sqlalchemy</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">SQLAlchemyDTO</span>

<span class="k">class</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nc">ReadWidget</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">SQLAlchemyDTO</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">Widget</span><span class="p">]):</span>
    <span class="n">config</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">DTOConfig</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">exclude</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="s2">&quot;id&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;internal_notes&quot;</span><span class="p">})</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This will give you a <abbr title="Data Transfer Object"><span class="caps">DTO</span></abbr> class containing all the fields of&nbsp;the <code>Widget</code> <abbr title="Object-Relational Mapper"><span class="caps">ORM</span></abbr> model <em>except</em> the two explicitly excluded, and will derive that set of fields, and the correct data types, from&nbsp;introspecting <code>Widget</code>. It will also automatically handle conversion to and from instances&nbsp;of <code>Widget</code> when you specify it as the input or return <abbr title="Data Transfer Object"><span class="caps">DTO</span></abbr> type of a route. Similarly, it’s possible to declare a list of fields to include, or to re-map field names for public consumption, or to declare a <abbr title="Data Transfer Object"><span class="caps">DTO</span></abbr> which makes fields optional for partial updates. This means there’s only one canonical definition of the fields—on the original class, which might be a SQLAlchemy <abbr title="Object-Relational Mapper"><span class="caps">ORM</span></abbr> model, might be&nbsp;a <code>dataclass</code>, etc.—and it doesn’t have to be repeated in the DTOs because the DTOs will always derive their field definitions directly from the source class you point them&nbsp;at.</p>
<p>Of course, there are going to be cases where your DTOs are sufficiently different from your DAOs and domain objects that this isn’t a big help, but my own experience is that “the <abbr title="Data Transfer Object"><span class="caps">DTO</span></abbr> is a subset of the <abbr title="Data Access Object"><span class="caps">DAO</span></abbr>’s fields” is extremely common in real-world applications, so Litestar’s approach really pays off in both reduced boilerplate and reduced errors from manual “transcription” of fields between different class&nbsp;definitions.</p>
<h2>Alchemical&nbsp;architecture</h2>
<p>I wasn’t exaggerating earlier when I said that SQLAlchemy is <em>the</em> database toolkit and <abbr title="Object-Relational Mapper"><span class="caps">ORM</span></abbr> for Python. While there are others out there, the only one I’m aware of that sees anything close to SQLAlchemy’s usage is the Django <abbr title="Object-Relational Mapper"><span class="caps">ORM</span></abbr>, and only because it’s built into and tightly integrated with Django. So if you’re going to be writing a database-backed web application in Python, and you’re not doing Django, you are almost certainly going to be using&nbsp;SQLAlchemy.</p>
<p>And Litestar makes that easy. While officially remaining agnostic as to whether you even have a persistence layer, it still includes good integrations for SQLAlchemy: the serialization plugin mentioned earlier allows the direct use of SQLAlchemy <abbr title="Object-Relational Mapper"><span class="caps">ORM</span></abbr> classes as input and output schemas; the <abbr title="Data Transfer Object"><span class="caps">DTO</span></abbr> helpers can derive subsets and remappings of fields from SQLAlchemy <abbr title="Object-Relational Mapper"><span class="caps">ORM</span></abbr> classes; and Litestar also ships with <a href="https://docs.litestar.dev/latest/usage/databases/sqlalchemy/plugins/sqlalchemy_init_plugin.html">a plugin that manages a SQLAlchemy engine and per-request <abbr title="Object-Relational Mapper"><span class="caps">ORM</span></abbr> session for you</a>, as well as <a href="https://docs.litestar.dev/latest/usage/databases/sqlalchemy/plugins/sqlalchemy_plugin.html">a single SQLAlchemy mega-plugin</a> combining all the SQLAlchemy plugins’&nbsp;functionality.</p>
<p>So it’s already pretty convenient to use SQLAlchemy in Litestar applications. But there’s more! The Litestar team also maintains <a href="https://docs.advanced-alchemy.litestar.dev/latest/">the excellent Advanced Alchemy library</a> which provides a bunch of useful features on top of SQLAlchemy. While Advanced Alchemy is framework-agnostic, Litestar’s SQLAlchemy plugin makes use of it and re-exports much of its functionality, giving you access to it automatically, and it does include Litestar-specific helpers for registering certain utility classes with Litestar’s dependency&nbsp;injection.</p>
<p>Advanced Alchemy provides a lot of quality-of-life improvements for SQLAlchemy, including a variety of base classes and mixins and data types doing useful things like database-agnostic big-integer primary keys, automatic create/update timestamps, <abbr title="Universally Unique IDentifier"><span class="caps">UUID</span></abbr>-keyed models, a proper <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time"><span class="caps">UTC</span></abbr> timestamp type, and a <abbr title="JavaScript Object Notation"><span class="caps">JSON</span></abbr> type which chooses the best column type for your database. There are also command-line helpers for database management (including creating and working with <a href="https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/">Alembic migrations</a>), database dumping and seeding to/from <abbr title="JavaScript Object Notation"><span class="caps">JSON</span></abbr>, and a lot&nbsp;more.</p>
<p>But the place where Advanced Alchemy really shines is in providing <a href="https://docs.advanced-alchemy.litestar.dev/latest/usage/repositories.html">a generic repository implementation</a> (both sync and async flavors) on top of SQLAlchemy models, along with <a href="https://docs.advanced-alchemy.litestar.dev/latest/usage/services.html">a service-layer abstraction</a> and helpers to integrate them into Litestar’s dependency injection&nbsp;system.</p>
<p>Here’s a basic example using&nbsp;the <code>Widget</code> class from&nbsp;above:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kn">from</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nn">litestar.plugins.sqlalchemy</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">repository</span>

<span class="k">class</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nc">WidgetRepository</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">repository</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">SQLAlchemyAsyncRepository</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">Widget</span><span class="p">]):</span>
    <span class="n">model_type</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Widget</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p><code>WidgetRepository</code> will have all the methods you’d&nbsp;expect—<code>list()</code>, <code>get_one()</code>, <code>add()</code>, <code>delete()</code>, etc.—automatically derived from&nbsp;the <code>Widget</code> model. And let me just say that having repository implementations automatically derived from any SQLAlchemy model, with not just basic <abbr title="Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete"><span class="caps">CRUD</span></abbr> operations but also things like paginated fetches, is a <em>massive</em> productivity boost compared to just using vanilla SQLAlchemy. It’s maybe not quite on the level of Django’s generic views, but it’s a big step in that direction, and you probably could produce something like Django’s generic views with Litestar and Advanced Alchemy if you wanted to (perhaps one day, in my copious free time, I’ll even make an attempt at&nbsp;it).</p>
<p>I know it may seem strange to hear me saying this, since a few years ago I went on record as being strongly <em>against</em> these sorts of abstractions—specifically service layers—in Django. And I still think you absolutely should not try to retrofit repository or service-layer abstractions onto Django! They’re not the native patterns of Django’s architecture, and instead I think you should stick to <a href="/weblog/2020/mar/16/no-service/">what I recommended back then</a>, which is to leverage Django’s own architecture, especially its “manager” abstraction, rather than trying to force abstractions onto it that don’t&nbsp;fit.</p>
<p>I also still think there are a lot of bad use cases for repositories and service layers that people should avoid, but that’s a digression which should probably become its own post, so I’ll just say for now that I think it’s fine to use repositories and service layers <em>as an organizing principle</em> when you’re using a less-structured framework which doesn’t express strong opinions about how you should lay out your code. And that’s exactly what I do when working with&nbsp;Litestar.</p>
<h2>A lightweight star of&nbsp;Python</h2>
<p>There are plenty of other features and conveniences in Litestar, many of which I use daily. Its auth system, supporting both <a href="https://docs.litestar.dev/latest/usage/security/guards.html">simple guard functions</a> and <a href="https://docs.litestar.dev/latest/usage/security/abstract-authentication-middleware.html">middlewares</a> for attaching identity and complex authn/authz logic to requests. Its <a href="https://docs.litestar.dev/latest/usage/stores.html">“stores” framework</a>, which makes caching and similar tasks convenient. Its <a href="https://docs.litestar.dev/latest/usage/logging.html">logging integrations</a> which support both the Python standard&nbsp;library’s <code>logging</code> module and popular third-party tools&nbsp;like <code>structlog</code>. Its built-in support for <a href="https://docs.litestar.dev/latest/usage/plugins/problem_details.html">transforming errors to standard &#8220;problem details&#8221; structures</a>. Its built-in support for <a href="https://docs.litestar.dev/latest/usage/metrics/index.html">recording and exporting metrics in standard Prometheus or OpenTelemetry formats</a>. Its <a href="https://docs.litestar.dev/latest/usage/htmx.html">htmx support</a>.</p>
<p>You can do this stuff in other microframeworks, but it typically involves a lot of tracking down of third-party add-ons and/or writing your own glue code to integrate things. Litestar manages to keep the “microframework” feel when starting a new project while also having all these nice bits optionally available with the framework itself when and if you decide you want them, and that’s nothing to sneeze at. That’s what I was getting at earlier when I said it reminds me of the things I like in certain frameworks from other languages. Litestar doesn’t feel, to me, like it’s trying to be a replacement for any pre-existing Python web framework. It’s not trying to be the next Django or the next Flask or whatever; instead, it feels to me like a Pythonic take on the good parts of something like Spring Boot (and the way I like to set it up, doing things like using <a href="https://svcs.hynek.me/en/stable/">svcs</a> behind the scenes as a service locator to feed things to both Litestar’s and <a href="https://docs.pytest.org/">pytest’s</a> dependency injection, makes it feel even more that&nbsp;way).</p>
<p>I could go on for a lot longer listing things I like about Litestar, and probably wind up way too far into my own subjective preferences, but hopefully I’ve given you enough of a realistic taste of what it offers that, next time you’re about to build a Python web app, you might decide to reach for 💡⭐ to carry you to the moon&nbsp;🚀🚀🚀.</p>

          <p class="text-base-content">
            <p>أهلاً وسهلاً بكم. من أكثر الأمور في نظام التشغيل ويندوز التي تستهلك الكثير من موارد الجهاز هي كثرة عمل الخدمات في الخلفية. كلما زاد عدد العمليات لنظام التشغيل والبرامج في الخلفية، زادت نسبة استهلاك موارد الجهاز مثل الرامات، المعالج، كارت الشاشة، والإنترنت، وهو ما يتسبب في بطء أداء ويندوز.</p>

<p>في المقابل، كلما قل عدد العمليات التي تعمل في الخلفية على نظام التشغيل، تحسن أداء النظام بنسبة كبيرة جداً. تقليل عدد العمليات في الخلفية يعني تقليل استهلاك موارد الجهاز. لذلك، يوجد إعداد بسيط جداً ومخفي في ويندوز بإمكانه تقليل نسبة كبيرة من عدد العمليات التي تعمل في الخلفية، وبالتالي ستشعر بتحسن كبير وملحوظ في أداء نظام التشغيل.</p>

<h3 id="ملاحظة-عدد-العمليات-الحالية">ملاحظة عدد العمليات الحالية</h3>
<p>للبداية، يمكننا إلقاء نظرة على عدد العمليات الحالية عبر مدير المهام في ويندوز 10 أو 11:</p>
<ol>
  <li>انقر بزر الماوس الأيمن على قائمة “ابدأ” (Start).</li>
  <li>اختر <strong>مدير المهام (Task Manager)</strong>.</li>
  <li>انتقل إلى تبويب <strong>الأداء (Performance)</strong>.</li>
  <li>اضغط على <strong>وحدة المعالجة المركزية (CPU)</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>ستجد عدد العمليات (Processes) الحالية. في هذا المثال، كان العدد <strong>176 عملية</strong>. قد يكون هذا الرقم أكبر لديك، مما يسبب استهلاكاً عالياً لموارد جهازك.</p>

<h2 id="الحل-تعديل-سجلات-ويندوز-registry">الحل: تعديل سجلات ويندوز (Registry)</h2>
<p>يوجد إعداد مخفي في النظام يمكن تعديله لتقليل عدد العمليات بشكل ملحوظ. هذا التعديل سيجعل كل خدمة تعمل بشكل منفصل بدلاً من تجميعها معاً، مما يقلل من استهلاك الموارد.</p>

<h3 id="خطوات-التعديل">خطوات التعديل</h3>
<ol>
  <li>من مربع البحث، اكتب <code class="highlighter-rouge">regedit</code> وافتح <strong>محرر السجلات (Registry Editor)</strong>.</li>
  <li>وافق على منح الأذونات بالضغط على “نعم” (Yes).</li>
  <li>في محرر السجلات، انتقل إلى المسار التالي:
    <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>ابحث عن قيمة باسم <strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">SvcHostSplitThresholdInKB</code></strong>. هذه هي القيمة المسؤولة عن تجميع الخدمات.</li>
  <li>انقر نقراً مزدوجاً عليها لتعديلها.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="تحديد-القيمة-الصحيحة-بناءً-على-حجم-الذاكرة-ram">تحديد القيمة الصحيحة بناءً على حجم الذاكرة (RAM)</h3>
<p>يجب إدخال قيمة محددة بناءً على حجم الذاكرة العشوائية (RAM) المثبتة على جهازك. لمعرفة حجم الذاكرة:</p>
<ul>
  <li>افتح <strong>مدير المهام (Task Manager)</strong> مرة أخرى.</li>
  <li>اذهب إلى <strong>الأداء (Performance)</strong> ثم <strong>الذاكرة (Memory)</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>بناءً على حجم الذاكرة لديك، استخدم القيمة المقابلة من القائمة التالية:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>8 جيجابايت رام:</strong> <code class="highlighter-rouge">800000</code></li>
  <li><strong>12 جيجابايت رام:</strong> <code class="highlighter-rouge">1200000</code></li>
  <li><strong>16 جيجابايت رام:</strong> <code class="highlighter-rouge">1600000</code></li>
  <li><strong>وأكثر:</strong> استمر بنفس النمط (مثلاً، 32 جيجابايت تكون <code class="highlighter-rouge">3200000</code>).</li>
</ul>

<p>في هذا المثال، الجهاز يحتوي على 8 جيجابايت، لذا تم حذف القيمة الافتراضية (التي قد تكون <code class="highlighter-rouge">380000</code>) وكتابة <code class="highlighter-rouge">800000</code>.</p>

<ol>
  <li>بعد إدخال الرقم الصحيح، اضغط على <strong>OK</strong> وأغلق محرر السجلات.</li>
  <li><strong>مهم:</strong> قم بإعادة تشغيل جهاز الكمبيوتر لتطبيق التغييرات.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="النتيجة-بعد-إعادة-التشغيل">النتيجة بعد إعادة التشغيل</h3>
<p>بعد إعادة تشغيل الجهاز، عند فتح مدير المهام مرة أخرى والتوجه إلى <strong>Performance &gt; CPU</strong>، ستلاحظ انخفاضاً كبيراً في عدد العمليات. في حالتنا، انخفض العدد من <strong>177</strong> إلى <strong>118</strong> عملية.</p>

<p>هذا الانخفاض في عدد العمليات سيحسن من أداء جهاز الكمبيوتر ويقلل من استهلاك موارد الجهاز مثل وحدة المعالجة المركزية، الذاكرة، الإنترنت، وبطاقة الرسوميات.</p>

<h2 id="خلاصة">خلاصة</h2>
<p>كما رأينا في هذا المقال، هذا إعداد مهم جداً يجب عليك تغييره لتحسين أداء ويندوز بشكل ملحوظ.</p>

            <p>مرحباً بكم. في هذا المقال، نستعرض لكم أفضل طريقة يمكنكم استخدامها لتثبيت أي إصدار من ويندوز بدون الحاجة إلى ذاكرة فلاش (USB) أو أي برامج خارجية. يمكنكم تثبيت أي إصدار من ويندوز مباشرة من جهاز الكمبيوتر نفسه.</p>

<p>على سبيل المثال، إذا كنتم تريدون تثبيت ويندوز 10، ويندوز 7، ويندوز 8، أو ويندوز 11، سواء كان جهازكم مدعوماً أم غير مدعوم، يمكنكم استخدام هذه الطريقة.</p>

<p>كل ما تحتاجونه هو ملف ISO الخاص بنسخة الويندوز التي تريدون تثبيتها. سنطبق هذا الشرح على تثبيت ويندوز 11، ولكن يمكنكم تطبيق نفس الخطوات على أي إصدار ويندوز آخر ترغبون في تثبيته.</p>

<h3 id="الخطوة-الأولى-إنشاء-قسم-جديد-على-القرص-الصلب">الخطوة الأولى: إنشاء قسم جديد على القرص الصلب</h3>

<p>المطلوب هو إنشاء قسم (Partition) جديد بحجم 10 جيجابايت لوضع ملفات نسخة الويندوز التي سنبدأ في تثبيتها.</p>

<ol>
  <li>انقر بزر الماوس الأيمن على قائمة ابدأ (Start)، ثم اختر <strong>إدارة الأقراص (Disk Management)</strong>.</li>
  <li>من القرص (C) أو أي قرص آخر متوفر لديكم، انقر بزر الماوس الأيمن عليه ثم اضغط على <strong>تقليص وحدة التخزين (Shrink Volume)</strong>.</li>
  <li>في الحقل المحدد، اكتب <code class="highlighter-rouge">9000</code> ميجابايت، وهو ما يعادل حوالي 8.5 جيجابايت، وهذا كافٍ.</li>
  <li>اضغط على <strong>تقليص (Shrink)</strong>. سيبدأ في إنشاء قسم جديد غير مستخدم كمساحة غير مخصصة (Unallocated Space).</li>
  <li>انقر بزر الماوس الأيمن على المساحة غير المخصصة، ثم اختر <strong>وحدة تخزين بسيطة جديدة (New Simple Volume)</strong>.</li>
  <li>اتبع المعالج بالضغط على <strong>التالي (Next)</strong> ثم <strong>التالي (Next)</strong>، وأخيراً <strong>إنهاء (Finish)</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>بهذا تم إنشاء قسم جديد بمساحة 8 جيجابايت تقريباً.</p>

<h3 id="الخطوة-الثانية-نسخ-ملفات-تثبيت-الويندوز">الخطوة الثانية: نسخ ملفات تثبيت الويندوز</h3>

<ol>
  <li>توجه إلى ملف ISO الخاص بنسخة الويندوز، انقر عليه بزر الماوس الأيمن واختر <strong>تحميل (Mount)</strong>، أو انقر عليه نقراً مزدوجاً.</li>
  <li>ستُفتح محتويات نسخة الويندوز. حدد جميع الملفات وانسخها (Copy).</li>
  <li>توجه إلى <strong>“هذا الكمبيوتر” (This PC)</strong>. ستجد القسم الجديد الذي أنشأناه بمساحة 8 جيجابايت.</li>
  <li>افتح القسم الجديد، وانقر بزر الماوس الأيمن ثم <strong>لصق (Paste)</strong> لوضع محتويات نسخة الويندوز.</li>
  <li>بعد انتهاء النقل، ارجع للخلف وقم بإعادة تسمية هذا القسم ليسهل التعرف عليه أثناء التثبيت. انقر عليه بزر الماوس الأيمن، اختر <strong>إعادة تسمية (Rename)</strong>، وسمّه على سبيل المثال: <code class="highlighter-rouge">install windows 11</code>.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="الخطوة-الثالثة-بدء-عملية-التثبيت">الخطوة الثالثة: بدء عملية التثبيت</h3>

<p>إذا كان لديكم مشاكل في جهاز الكمبيوتر ولا يعمل، ولا يوجد ذاكرة فلاش أو قرص صلب خارجي، يمكنكم تثبيت ويندوز جديد بهذه الطريقة.</p>

<ol>
  <li>اضغط على قائمة ابدأ (Start)، ثم على أيقونة الطاقة (Power).</li>
  <li>اضغط على مفتاح <strong>Shift</strong> باستمرار ثم انقر على <strong>إعادة التشغيل (Restart)</strong>.</li>
  <li>سيتم إعادة تشغيل الجهاز وتحويلكم إلى إعدادات بدء التشغيل المتقدمة.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="الدخول-إلى-موجه-الأوامر">الدخول إلى موجه الأوامر</h4>

<ol>
  <li>في شاشة الخيارات، اضغط على <strong>استكشاف الأخطاء وإصلاحها (Troubleshoot)</strong>.</li>
  <li>ثم اضغط على <strong>خيارات متقدمة (Advanced options)</strong>.</li>
  <li>ثم اختر <strong>موجه الأوامر (Command Prompt)</strong>.</li>
  <li>اختر اسم المستخدم الخاص بك. إذا كان جهازكم محمياً بكلمة مرور، فأدخلها ثم اضغط <strong>متابعة (Continue)</strong>. إذا لم يكن هناك كلمة مرور، اترك الحقل فارغاً واضغط <strong>متابعة (Continue)</strong>.</li>
  <li>سيفتح موجه الأوامر. اكتب الأمر التالي واضغط على Enter:
    <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>notepad
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>من قائمة <strong>ملف (File)</strong> في Notepad، اضغط على <strong>فتح (Open)</strong>.</li>
  <li>توجه إلى <strong>“هذا الكمبيوتر” (This PC)</strong>. ستظهر لكم الأقراص. كل ما نحتاجه هو معرفة حرف القرص الذي وضعنا فيه ملفات الويندوز. ستلاحظون أننا سمينا القسم <code class="highlighter-rouge">install windows 11</code>، والحرف المخصص له هو (D)، وهذا هو الحرف الذي نحتاجه.</li>
  <li>أغلق نافذة الفتح وعد إلى موجه الأوامر.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="تشغيل-ملف-التثبيت">تشغيل ملف التثبيت</h4>

<ol>
  <li>اكتب حرف القسم متبوعاً بنقطتين رأسيتين، ثم اضغط Enter. في حالتنا:
    <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>D:
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>اكتب الأمر التالي لعرض محتويات القسم:
    <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>dir
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>ستظهر الملفات، ومن بينها ملف <code class="highlighter-rouge">setup.exe</code>. لتشغيله، اكتب الأمر التالي واضغط Enter:
    <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>setup.exe
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>سيبدأ معالج تثبيت ويندوز مباشرة.</p>

<h4 id="تجاوز-متطلبات-التشغيل-لويندوز-11">تجاوز متطلبات التشغيل (لويندوز 11)</h4>

<p>إذا كنتم تثبتون ويندوز 11 على جهاز مدعوم، يمكنكم استكمال الخطوات بشكل طبيعي. أما إذا كان جهازكم غير مدعوم، فستظهر رسالة تفيد بأن الجهاز لا يلبي المتطلبات (مثلاً، لا يحتوي على TPM 2.0 أو ذاكرة RAM أقل من 4 جيجابايت).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>ملاحظة:</strong> دائماً ما يُنصح بعدم تثبيت ويندوز 11 على جهاز لا يحتوي على 8 جيجابايت من الذاكرة العشوائية (RAM) على الأقل للحصول على تجربة استخدام سلسة.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>لتجاوز هذه المشكلة:</p>
<ol>
  <li>أغلق نافذة التثبيت بالضغط على <strong>إغلاق (Close)</strong>.</li>
  <li>في موجه الأوامر، اكتب الأمر التالي بدقة. هذا الأمر يتجاوز فحص المتطلبات.
    <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>setup.exe /product server
</code></pre></div>    </div>
    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>تنبيه:</strong> تأكدوا من أن الأمر مكتوب بهذا الشكل تماماً، بما في ذلك المسافات والنقطة.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>اضغط على Enter. سيبدأ معالج التثبيت مرة أخرى، ولكن هذه المرة سيتجاوز فحص المتطلبات.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="تهيئة-القرص-ومتابعة-التثبيت">تهيئة القرص ومتابعة التثبيت</h4>

<ol>
  <li>اتبع خطوات التثبيت الأولية (اللغة، المنطقة، إلخ).</li>
  <li>اضغط على <code class="highlighter-rouge">I don't have a product key</code>.</li>
  <li>اختر إصدار الويندوز الذي تريد تثبيته (مثلاً، Pro) ثم <strong>التالي (Next)</strong>.</li>
  <li>وافق على شروط الترخيص.</li>
  <li>ستصل إلى مرحلة اختيار القرص.
    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>تنبيه هام:</strong> انتبهوا إلى أن القسم المسمى <code class="highlighter-rouge">install windows 11</code> (حجمه حوالي 8-9 جيجابايت) هو القسم الذي يحتوي على ملفات التثبيت، لذا <strong>لا تقم بتهيئته أو حذفه</strong>.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>حدد القرص الآخر الذي تريد تثبيت الويندوز عليه (عادة ما يكون القرص الأساسي (Primary) ويمكن التعرف عليه من مساحته).</li>
  <li>حدد ذلك القرص ثم اضغط على <strong>تهيئة (Format)</strong>. انتظر حتى تكتمل العملية.</li>
  <li>تأكد من أن المساحة الإجمالية للقرص أصبحت نفس المساحة الحرة (Free Space).</li>
  <li>حدد القرص المهيأ مرة أخرى واضغط على <strong>التالي (Next)</strong>.</li>
  <li>ستظهر شاشة تأكيد. اضغط على <strong>تثبيت (Install)</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>سيبدأ الويندوز الآن في نسخ الملفات وإكمال عملية التثبيت.</p>

<h3 id="الخطوة-الرابعة-إعدادات-ما-بعد-التثبيت">الخطوة الرابعة: إعدادات ما بعد التثبيت</h3>

<p>بعد إعادة التشغيل، سيقوم الويندوز بإكمال الإعدادات.</p>

<h4 id="تجاوز-إنشاء-حساب-مايكروسوفت">تجاوز إنشاء حساب مايكروسوفت</h4>

<p>عندما تصل إلى مرحلة إضافة حساب مايكروسوفت، إذا كنتم لا ترغبون في استخدامه وتفضلون حساباً محلياً:</p>
<ol>
  <li>اضغط على مفتاحي <code class="highlighter-rouge">Shift + F10</code> لفتح موجه الأوامر.</li>
  <li>اكتب الأمر التالي ثم اضغط على Enter:
    <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>start ms-cxh:localonly
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>ستظهر نافذة لإنشاء حساب محلي. في الحقل الأول، اكتب اسم المستخدم.</li>
  <li>إذا أردت إضافة كلمة مرور، اكتبها في الحقلين التاليين. إذا لم ترد، اتركهما فارغين.</li>
  <li>اضغط على <strong>التالي (Next)</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>سيتم تجاوز خطوة حساب مايكروسوفت، وسيكمل الويندوز الإعدادات النهائية ثم يأخذك إلى سطح المكتب.</p>

<h3 id="الخطوة-الخامسة-استعادة-مساحة-القسم-اختياري">الخطوة الخامسة: استعادة مساحة القسم (اختياري)</h3>

<p>بعد العودة إلى سطح المكتب، القسم الذي أنشأناه في البداية لا يزال موجوداً. يمكنكم تركه كنسخة احتياطية لتثبيت الويندوز مستقبلاً بسهولة. إذا أردتم حذف القسم واستعادة مساحته:</p>

<ol>
  <li>توجه إلى <strong>إدارة الأقراص (Disk Management)</strong>.</li>
  <li>ابحث عن القسم المسمى <code class="highlighter-rouge">install windows 11</code>. انقر عليه بزر الماوس الأيمن واختر <strong>حذف وحدة التخزين (Delete Volume)</strong>.</li>
  <li>إذا كانت المساحة المحذوفة بجوار القرص (C) مباشرة، انقر بزر الماوس الأيمن على (C) واختر <strong>توسيع وحدة التخزين (Extend Volume)</strong> لدمج المساحة.</li>
  <li>إذا كان هناك قسم استرداد (Recovery) يفصل بينهما، فستحتاج إلى أداة خارجية مثل <strong>MiniTool Partition Wizard</strong>.
    <ul>
      <li>ابحث عن البرنامج وقم بتنزيل النسخة المجانية.</li>
      <li>بعد التثبيت، افتح البرنامج.</li>
      <li>انقر بزر الماوس الأيمن على القرص (C) واختر <strong>Extend</strong>.</li>
      <li>حدد المساحة غير المخصصة (Unallocated Space) واسحب شريط التمرير إلى النهاية.</li>
      <li>اضغط <strong>OK</strong> ثم <strong>Apply</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>سيتم دمج المساحة مرة أخرى في القرص الرئيسي.</p>

          <p class="text-base-content">
            <p>اليوم سأشارككم أدوات الذكاء الاصطناعي التي أستخدمها كل يوم، والتي أصبحت جزءًا لا يتجزأ مني ومن حياتي ولا أستطيع العيش بدونها. يأتي هذا بعد محاولات وتجارب عديدة مع أدوات كثيرة جدًا، بعضها كان مفيدًا بالفعل وبعضها استخدمته مرة واحدة ولم أكرر التجربة. لذلك، أتيتكم اليوم بالخلاصة. لا تقلقوا، فأغلب أو كل الأدوات التي أستخدمها مجانية، وستتمكنون من تجربة كل الأدوات التي أستخدمها اليوم مجانًا. إذا كنتم مهتمين بالذكاء الاصطناعي والمستقبل والأعمال، فكونوا متابعين أولاً بأول لأن الفترة القادمة سنتحدث كثيرًا عن هذه الأمور. بدون إطالة، لنبدأ.</p>

<h3 id="1-chatgpt">1. ChatGPT</h3>
<p>أول وأشهر وأقوى أداة ذكاء اصطناعي أستخدمها يوميًا. بالطبع، لقد خمنتم جميعكم الأداة الآن، وهي ChatGPT، أشهر أداة ذكاء اصطناعي في العالم حاليًا، وأنا أستخدمها تقريبًا في كل شيء.</p>

<p>على سبيل المثال:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>التعلم والمذاكرة:</strong> عندما أذاكر ويصادفني شيء لا أفهمه، ألجأ إليه لسؤاله على الفور. قد يقول قائل الآن: “أي مذاكرة هذه، ألم تتخرج بالفعل؟”. يا صديقي، الطبيب يذاكر طوال عمره. وبشكل عام، أي شيء جديد أريد أن أتعلمه الآن، فبدلاً من البحث عن دورات تدريبية، يساعدني ChatGPT في هذا الموضوع في ثوانٍ. وإذا لم أفهم الأمر، أجعله يشرح لي بأكثر من طريقة وأسلوب حتى أفهمه جيدًا. سأريكم مثالاً عملياً على ذلك في مقال قادم، حيث سننشئ فيه تطبيق جوال من الصفر حتى نصل إلى تطبيقًا كاملاً يعمل على الجوال ويمكنكم تجربته وتنزيله بأنفسكم، كل هذا دون كتابة سطر برمجي واحد ودون أن أكون على دراية بأي شيء عن برمجة تطبيقات الجوال. وبالمناسبة، أنا لم أنشئ تطبيق جوال كاملاً في حياتي من قبل، لذا ستكون تجربة قوية جدًا، آمل ذلك.</li>
  <li><strong>صناعة المحتوى:</strong> عندما أشرع في إعداد مقال جديد، يساعدني ChatGPT في إعداد المسودة، لأنه ينبهني إلى نقاط كثيرة ربما لم أكن منتبهًا لها أو قد نسيتها. هو لا يكتب لي المسودة بالكامل، ولكنه يساعدني كثيرًا ويلفت نظري لأمور لا أكون منتبهًا لها في أوقات كثيرة. وأحيانًا يقترح عليّ أفكار مقالات جيدة لأكتبها، لذلك هو يساعدني في صناعة المحتوى كثيرًا الآن وسهّل عليّ كل شيء.</li>
  <li><strong>تخطيط الأعمال:</strong> إذا قررت أن أبدأ عملاً تجاريًا جديدًا، مثل المشاريع التي جربناها من قبل أو التي أجهز لها في هذه الفترة، فألجأ إليه لأسأله وأفهم منه ما هي الأمور التي يجب أن أنتبه إليها، وماذا سأحتاج أن أتعلم بالضبط، وما هو الفريق الذي سأحتاجه، وما هو نموذج العمل الخاص بي، وهكذا. وهو بالفعل يفيدني كثيرًا في هذا الموضوع.</li>
</ul>

<p>باختصار، ChatGPT هو ذراعي الأيمن في كل شيء في حياتي الآن. أي شيء يتعطل معي، أي مشكلة، أي أمر أحتاج فيه إلى رأي شخص ما أو نصائح في الحياة بشكل عام، أيًا كان، ستجده عونًا لك حقًا.</p>

<p>حقًا، إذا لم تكن تستخدمه، يجب أن تبدأ في استخدامه الآن، لأنه عن تجربة سيغير حياتك 180 درجة وسيسهل عليك كل شيء، وستقول لنفسك: “كيف لم أكن أستخدمه طوال الفترة الماضية؟”. لدي صديق كل عمله متعلق بالمحاماة والقضاء وهذه الأمور، لم يكن يستخدم ChatGPT على الإطلاق من قبل، ولكن عندما عرفته عليه وكيفية استخدامه، عاد إليّ في اليوم التالي منبهرًا جدًا بالموضوع ويقول لي إنه أمضى الليلة بأكملها يتحدث معه في مواضيع مختلفة وجعله يحلل القضايا وما إلى ذلك، وظل يسأله في أمور كثيرة جدًا وغير مصدق كيف أنه طوال الفترة الماضية لم يكن يعلم بوجود أداة كهذه.</p>

<p>فحقًا، إذا لم تجربه حتى الآن، فقد فاتك الكثير. وسيكون هناك مقال قريب جدًا أجهزه الآن، سنشرح فيه ChatGPT كما لم تعرفه من قبل، بكل استخداماته الممكنة في مختلف مجالات الحياة، وسأريك كمية الميزات والإمكانيات الموجودة فيه التي لن تصدق وجودها. ستنبهرون في النهاية.</p>

<p>مشكلته الوحيدة حاليًا هي أنه عند استخدامه مجانًا، يكون لك حد استخدام يومي، وعندما تنهي هذا الحد، يجعلك تستخدم نموذج ذكاء اصطناعي أقل ذكاءً، وأنا لا أحب ذلك بصراحة.</p>

<h3 id="2-grok">2. Grok</h3>
<p>عندما يحدث ذلك، ألجأ إلى ثاني أكثر أداة أحبها، وهي Grok من شركة xAI التابعة لإيلون ماسك. هذه من أجمل أدوات الذكاء الاصطناعي التي جربتها بصراحة وأحبها جدًا، وكانت مفاجأة بالنسبة لي. إنها أداة رائعة وتساعدك أيضًا في أغلب أو كل الأشياء التي قد تحتاجها من الذكاء الاصطناعي. وبصراحة، كلما مر الوقت أشعر أنني أميل إليه أكثر وأحبه أكثر. وقد صدر له اليوم تحديث جديد، وهو الإصدار الرابع منه، ووفقًا لما قيل، هو الآن أقوى وأذكى ذكاء اصطناعي على وجه الأرض. فحاول أن تجربه، لن تخسر شيئًا.</p>

<p>الأمر الذي يتفوق فيه Grok كثيرًا على ChatGPT، والذي لا يوجد أي ذكاء اصطناعي آخر على مستوى العالم يمكنه منافسته فيه، هو الأخبار والمعلومات الجديدة. لماذا؟ لأن Grok تابع لإيلون ماسك، وإيلون ماسك كان قد اشترى شركة تويتر، أو X حاليًا. ومنصة X معروف أن عليها كل أخبار العالم الجديدة لحظة بلحظة. الأمر غريب، فإيلون ماسك كان من أحد مؤسسي شركة OpenAI التي أنشأت ChatGPT، وهم الآن يتنافسون وقد رفعوا قضايا على بعضهم البعض. يبدو أن أي أمر كبير يحدث في العالم الآن يقف وراءه إيلون ماسك.</p>

<p>المهم، أنا عندما أرغب في معرفة آخر الأخبار في أي مجال، أو آخر الأخبار عمومًا، فإن Grok يساعدني جدًا في هذا الموضوع، ولا أعتقد بصراحة أن هناك أي أداة أخرى يمكنها منافسته في هذا الأمر مهما حدث.</p>

<p>هناك أيضًا ميزة خاصة جدًا، وهي أنه عندما أكون أتصفح منصة X وتصادفني تغريدة لا أفهمها، يمكنني بضغطة زر واحدة أن أنتقل تلقائيًا إلى Grok ليشرح لي هذه التغريدة، ويمكنني أن أكمل معه المحادثة وأجعله يفهمني أكثر وأكثر. بالنسبة لي هذه ميزة قوية جدًا وسهلت عليّ أمورًا كثيرة. أشعر أنني قريبًا سأنتقل بشكل كامل إلى Grok بدلاً من ChatGPT، لأنه قوي جدًا بصراحة.</p>

<h3 id="3-perplexity">3. Perplexity</h3>
<p>الأداة التالية هي Perplexity. حتى الآن، لم أرَ أداة تتفوق عليها في مجال البحث (Research)، أو في الإعداد لمقالات جديدة على سبيل المثال. هي أداة قوية في أمور كثيرة وتشبه ChatGPT، ولكنها تتميز بشدة في أنها تقدم أي معلومة مع مصدرها، لتكون متأكدًا من أن كل معلومة مكتوبة صحيحة، لأن الذكاء الاصطناعي أحيانًا يختلق أمورًا من عنده، وهو ما يسمى في عالم الذكاء الاصطناعي بـ “الهلوسة” (Hallucination). هذه الأداة تقدم لك كل شيء مع مصدره، ويمكنك الدخول إلى المصدر بنفسك لتتأكد من كل معلومة. بالنسبة لي، أستخدم هذه الأداة مع ChatGPT في التجهيز للمقالات، ولكن بصراحة لا أستخدمها في باقي الأمور. هي بالنسبة لي قوية ومميزة في هذه النقطة فقط.</p>

<h3 id="4-gemini">4. Gemini</h3>
<p>الأداة التالية هي Gemini من شركة جوجل. في الماضي، لم تكن هذه الأداة الأفضل على الإطلاق ولم يكن أحد يفضلها، ولكنهم الآن بدأوا في تطويرها بشكل هائل، ومع الوقت تصبح أفضل وأفضل. خصوصًا الآن، أصبحت جيدة جدًا في البرمجة، بل قوية جدًا. جربتها أيضًا في عدة أمور أخرى ووجدتها أصبحت ممتازة. لكن بصراحة، لا أستخدمها كثيرًا حاليًا لأن الأدوات الأخرى تفي بالغرض معي، كما أنني لا يعجبني تصميم Gemini كثيرًا، لذا أستخدمها بين الحين والآخر.</p>

<p>ولكن، أعتقد مما أراه الآن أن Gemini قريبًا جدًا ستصبح من أقوى نماذج الذكاء الاصطناعي، إن لم تكن الأقوى بالفعل، ومن الممكن جدًا أن تتفوق على الجميع. هذا مجرد توقع، ليس أكثر، لأن جوجل تستثمر بقوة في هذا المجال، فسنرى. نحن نعيش حقًا في أكثر العصور جنونًا في تاريخ البشرية، فكل شيء تعرفه يمكن أن يتغير بين يوم وليلة.</p>

<p>من النقاط القوية في Gemini أيضًا أنه يمكنك دمجه مع أدوات جوجل الأخرى واستخدامه معها، مثل Gmail، وGoogle Docs، وYouTube، وغيرها. هذه ستكون نقطة قوية جدًا لصالح جوجل في المستقبل. فقط لو اهتموا بها قليلاً، فستصل إلى مستوى آخر بالفعل.</p>

<h3 id="ملاحظة-هامة">ملاحظة هامة</h3>
<p>ما أريدك أن تعرفه حتى الآن هو أنه لا توجد أداة منهم كاملة؛ بالنسبة لي، إنهم يكملون بعضهم البعض، وكل أداة منهم مميزة في نقطة معينة أو في شيء معين. لذلك، كل فترة ستسمع أن الذكاء الاصطناعي الفلاني أصبح هو الأقوى، فمن الصعب أن تستقر على أداة واحدة. يجب أن تكون مرنًا في عصر الذكاء الاصطناعي، وأن تتابع المقالات التي ننشرها هنا أولاً بأول لتبقى على اطلاع بكل جديد وتحدد ما هو الأنسب لك.</p>

<h3 id="5-auphonic">5. Auphonic</h3>
<p>الأداة التالية هي Auphonic، والتي أستخدمها بكل اختصار لتحسين جودة الصوت بضغطة زر واحدة بمساعدة الذكاء الاصطناعي. هي أداة مجانية تمنحك ساعتين كل شهر مجانًا لاستخدامها، وهي بصراحة تكفيني ويزيدون عن حاجتي أيضًا كل شهر، ربما لأنني لا أنشئ محتوى باستمرار. ولكن حقًا، إذا كنت تنشئ محتوى، حاول تجربتها، صدقني ستحدث فرقًا كبيرًا معك.</p>

<h3 id="6-cursor">6. Cursor</h3>
<p>الأداة الأخيرة التي أستخدمها في يومي هي Cursor. للأسف، هي الأداة الوحيدة المدفوعة من بينها، ولكنها بصراحة تستحق كل مبلغ يُدفع فيها. كنت قد تحدثت معكم عنها من قبل في مقال سابق عن البرمجة. بشكل عام، فكرة الأداة هي أنها تمكنك من إنشاء أي برنامج، موقع ويب، تطبيق، أو أيًا كان ما تريد إنشاءه، دون كتابة سطر برمجي واحد ودون أن تكون على دراية بأي شيء عن البرمجة. هذه الأداة هي التي أستخدمها لأبدأ أي عمل تجاري أو مشروع جديد وأبرمجه في أقل وقت ممكن. لقد أنشأنا بها أشياء كثيرة، مثل منصتي التعليمية، منصة تنمية، وأشياء أخرى كثيرة تحدثت معكم عنها من قبل وسنعلن عنها قريبًا جدًا.</p>

<h3 id="خاتمة">خاتمة</h3>
<p>كانت هذه هي الأدوات التي أستخدمها بشكل شبه يومي. لا تزال هناك أدوات أخرى كثيرة جدًا، وسأجرب معكم أروع وأقوى هذه الأدوات في المقالات القادمة. هذه الأدوات قد لا تستخدمها كل يوم، ولكنك ستحتاج إلى استخدامها في أوقات وحالات معينة. فاستعدوا للقادم.</p>

<p>أراكم في مقال جديد، مع تحدٍ جديد وتجربة جديدة.</p>

We know how important this program is to many in our community and making this decision was difficult. This is a necessary step to protect both the future of the program and the short- and long-term sustainability of the PSF. (If this moves you immediately to donate to the PSF, we welcome your contributions via <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/donations/" target="_blank">our donations page</a>).</p><p></p><h3 style="text-align: left;">The PSF Grants Program is paused</h3><p>As <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/12/psf-grants-program-charter-updates-tldr.html" target="_blank">we shared in December 2024</a> (specifically, <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/12/12psf-grants-program-charter-updates-part-3.html" target="_blank">part 3</a>), the PSF implemented changes to the Grants Program in March 2025 in an effort to ensure the sustainability of the program and the foundation. PSF Staff have been checking in quarterly on our award expenditure, and at the end of Q1, we were on track. When PSF Staff reviewed approved grant awards at the end of Q2, however, we had granted close to 80% of the 2025 grant budget. The grant applications received so far through July exceed the budget ceiling.&nbsp;<br /><br />What does this mean? <b>The PSF Board has voted to implement a pause, effective August 1st, 2025, on the PSF Grants Program.</b> The PSF Board and Staff explored our options thoroughly before coming to this tough, and frankly painful, decision as we deeply understand how important the grants program is to the Python community.&nbsp;<br /><br />Everyone at the PSF is constantly amazed and impressed with the creativity, drive, and ingenuity of the Python community. Supporting the community’s success with our Grants Program is at the heart of our mission—and it brings so much joy to the PSF Board, our small but mighty team of staff, and the wonderful folks in our Work Groups. We are heartbroken to have to pause that work and we know this will be challenging and create more difficult decisions in turn for the many community groups that had planned to apply for the grants program.&nbsp;<br /><br />We will be distributing the small amount of remaining funds in the 2025 PSF Grants Program budget. To honor the time and energy spent on applications already submitted and in the spirit of equity, <b>any applications that were received before August 1st, 2025 will be granted a uniform percentage of the award amount for which they are eligible.</b> If you have a grant application in the system, you will receive an email from us soon with more information. Please send any urgent inquiries to grants@python.org.<br /><br />The PSF aims to be as transparent as possible, and we want to have two-way conversations with the community about this change. We are holding an additional <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/02/introducing-psf-grants-office-hours.html" target="_blank">PSF Grants Program Office Hour</a> in August on the <a href="https://discord.gg/7rthGF3BBe" target="_blank">PSF Discord</a>. We welcome folks to join both or either session:<br /></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>August 13th, 8-9 pm UTC</li><li>August 19th, 1-2 pm UTC</li></ul><p>We also welcome your feedback, particularly how we can support you during this pause, via email to grants@python.org or on the <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/the-psf-has-paused-our-grants-program/101288" target="_blank">thread we’ve started on discuss.python.org</a>.<br /></p><h3 style="text-align: left;">How we got here&nbsp;</h3><div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: left;">Since announcing Grants program changes in December 2024, grant requests
 have grown about 40% over last year. It’s wonderful to see long-time 
events continue to grow. It’s been equally inspiring to see events being
 revived as we move further from 2020 and the start of the COVID 
pandemic, alongside brand-new initiatives from new and seasoned 
organizers. The PSF <b>loves</b> seeing the growth, but the heart of the
 issue is that Python and its community continue to grow exponentially, 
while our funding has not kept pace, and in fact, has decreased.<br /><br />With Python being the <a href="https://github.blog/news-insights/octoverse/octoverse-2024/" target="_blank">number one language on GitHub</a> and <a href="https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/" target="_blank">rising steadily on the TIOBE index</a>,
 it’s no surprise that our community continues to build and grow as 
well. You can see the TIOBE 
index shows what the growth of Python looks like over the years, and how
 much it’s grown in just the past year:<br />&nbsp;</div><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEht7GZUmYfp6B2461-DVgvVlWa5wo2t7n-p5ZOhwU6JHpLM6Nvisw7UHelNjU2P408QYUPGT0amf_zxq9q6Z8b6n0DO7tK86RPkxUQbg7puBF1cWPV3cUMbLkQgESH27-IhezznZd3HAHx6twIQ8psDLoSNZZh0I9mcB0jriqZiadlo3QTaYQ/s2953/python_tiobe.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="244" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEht7GZUmYfp6B2461-DVgvVlWa5wo2t7n-p5ZOhwU6JHpLM6Nvisw7UHelNjU2P408QYUPGT0amf_zxq9q6Z8b6n0DO7tK86RPkxUQbg7puBF1cWPV3cUMbLkQgESH27-IhezznZd3HAHx6twIQ8psDLoSNZZh0I9mcB0jriqZiadlo3QTaYQ/w400-h244/python_tiobe.png" width="400" /></a></div><p>By contrast, the PSF’s available resources have decreased over the last three years and are projected to decrease again in 2025 due to increasing PyCon US and foundation costs. Much of the growth shown before 2022 in the chart below comes from grants we received that were restricted funds dedicated to specific staffing and other programs. The result is increasing global community activity against a decreasing pool of available funds.&nbsp;</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiiH_a89NPF5ydqQMcvx1HaZmdKCIeGc-OX4wf23Fwirp9wqD5QSxY414NJUJW3mH9UUP6CzgkU65mrVOhDHamy5aZXJp8_b1QW0m5OkHNVknnJAQ1OXnWA0i7soEK36os6920emjp5xPGcSHlTIxKSYC09fl_LDjxXQWC8-_yzQ7vH41Gw3w/s782/psf_asset_trends.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="640" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiiH_a89NPF5ydqQMcvx1HaZmdKCIeGc-OX4wf23Fwirp9wqD5QSxY414NJUJW3mH9UUP6CzgkU65mrVOhDHamy5aZXJp8_b1QW0m5OkHNVknnJAQ1OXnWA0i7soEK36os6920emjp5xPGcSHlTIxKSYC09fl_LDjxXQWC8-_yzQ7vH41Gw3w/w464-h640/psf_asset_trends.png" width="464" /></a></div><p></p>For example, 2023 year-end assets were $5.5M with total grants awarded 
at $677K. The following year, 2024 assets decreased slightly to $4.3M, 
but grants awarded jumped to $952K. You can see in the graph above how 
that negatively impacted our assets, a trend that is not sustainable 
even in the short term.

 <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/12/12psf-grants-program-charter-updates-part-3.html" target="_blank">PSF Grants Program adjustments implemented earlier this year</a> aimed to 
reduce total grant award spending while providing a more equitable 
approach, but the growth in new/revived grant applications outpaced the 
lowered caps and other limits. As we reviewed Q2 spending, it became 
clear that the unexpected influx of qualified grant proposals had 
already almost exhausted the total amount we had budgeted for the full 
year.&nbsp;<br /><br /></p><p></p><h3 style="text-align: left;">We’re in this together</h3><p>The
 PSF is in a similar position to the many other organizations and NGOs 
(and all of our volunteer conference and meetup organizers!) trying to 
support the Python community and foundation while faced with inflation, 
lower sponsorship, economic pressure in the tech sector, and 
global/local uncertainty and conflict.&nbsp;<br /><br />Last year, <a href="https://pycon.blogspot.com/2024/11/important-changes-ahead-commitment-to.html" target="_blank">the PyCon US blog explained</a> that PyCon US 2024 generated a significant loss; losses 
from PyCon US are paid for by PSF general funds that are also the 
financial source for the PSF Grants programs. For many years, PyCon US 
created a surplus used to fund Grants, PSF staff, and other programs. 
Based on the current numbers for PyCon US 2025, the PSF will need to 
fund another loss. Many factors including the lower-than-budgeted 
attendance, higher location costs, and the current economic and 
political situation contributed to the loss despite incredible efforts 
by staff and volunteers to control costs.&nbsp;<br /></p><h3 style="text-align: left;">What’s the solution?</h3><p>In
 an ideal world, we wouldn’t need to pause the Grants Program and would 
instead be granting even MORE awards to our inspiring community. And 
while that’s not currently the case, we do think you can help us unpause
 the grants program and fund the PSF’s other work. <b>The PSF needs more 
support and resources from the corporations that are built on and making
 revenue from Python. As a community, let’s ask corporations to step up 
and sustain the health of the community and programming language they 
rely on.</b> The AI sector, for example, relies heavily on Python and is 
mostly <a href="https://georgiker.com/blog/is-ai-leaving-python-community-behind/" target="_blank">untapped for the PSF, PyCon US, and our entire community</a>. If you 
have potential sponsorship connections (in AI or otherwise) we welcome 
you to send us leads or connect us via sponsors@python.org.&nbsp;<br /><br />The 
PSF is ever grateful for our sponsors, past and current, and we do 
everything we can to make their sponsorships beneficial and rewarding. 
PSF Staff also work hard to make those sponsorship dollars stretch as 
far as they can. Frankly, the PSF simply needs more sponsorship to 
continue to support the astonishing growth of Python and its community.<br /><br />The
 PSF is also incredibly grateful for our individual donors and PSF 
members. We truly couldn’t do this without you. If you’re inspired to 
help because of this post, we urge you to ask your employers to sponsor 
the PSF. Send them the <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/sponsorship/" target="_blank">PSF’s sponsorship page</a>! We know times are 
financially challenging for everyone, but if you’re feeling very 
inspired and in a position to donate, we welcome your contributions via 
the <a href="https://psfmember.org/civicrm/contribute/transact/?reset=1&amp;id=2" target="_blank">PSF’s donation page</a>. You can also join us as a <a href="https://psfmember.org/python-software-foundation-supporting-member-2/" target="_blank">PSF Supporting Member</a>
 (<a href="https://psfmember.org/civicrm/contribute/transact/?reset=1&amp;id=39" target="_blank">a sliding scale is also available!</a>), to invest in the future of Python
 and its community.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Some additional context</h3><p>As PSF Staff reviewed the Q2 numbers for the Grants Program, we found the following:<br /></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li><b>Revived events. </b>10
 out of the 75 (or about 13%) grants applications we’ve received in 2025
 are for “revived” grant applications for events that weren’t run in 
2024 (including one that hasn’t been run since 2015, whoa!).</li><li><b>Net new applications. </b>19
 out of the 75 (or about 25%) grant applications we’ve received in 2025 
are for totally new events and initiatives. While we did expect some 
growth, this is tremendous!</li><li><b>Earlier applications.</b> We 
encouraged folks to apply earlier—and you did, thank you! We weren’t 
expecting this level of awarding by mid-year. We also expect that to 
continue, so we can now plan better for that in the future.</li><li><b>Higher $$ requests.</b> Across all returning applications the amount being requested is about 13% higher than in years previous.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>While
 we expected more interest from the community in the PSF grants program,
 the amount of growth far exceeded our expectations.&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">What’s next?</h3><p>The
 PSF is working on our strategy to balance support for the worldwide 
Python community and funding constraints, now and in the future. The 
unknown and rapidly growing number of new Python events and 
initiatives—combined with the ongoing needs of existing events and 
organizations that have historically relied on the PSF Grants Program—is
 challenging to manage sustainably on a rolling application basis.<br /><br />So, here’s our plan:<br /></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>First, the PSF Board will continue to refine the grant program’s guiding principles and how they translate into program policy.&nbsp;</li><li>From
 there, PSF Staff will research, plan, and implement a quarterly review 
and awarding approach for the PSF Grants Program to provide an equitable
 and financially sustainable process.</li></ul><p>Moving to a quarterly 
review process from the rolling approval process the Grants Program 
currently uses will be a big change! We will do our best to implement 
processes that work well for the community, the Grants Workgroup, and 
PSF Staff.&nbsp;</p><p>Even with our best efforts, we acknowledge that there will be
 learning opportunities around moving to a quarterly review and most 
likely a series of adjustments ahead of us to get things working 
smoothly. Your feedback as grant applicants and recipients will be 
extremely helpful as we take on this journey. During this process, we 
will determine on what timeline we can re-open the Grants Program. You 
can expect updates from us on the future of the PSF Grants Program in 
early 2026.</p>

            <p><a href="https://nookipedia.com/wiki/Animal_Crossing">Animal Crossing</a> for the GameCube was a game far ahead of its
time and one of my personal favorites growing up. One of the
most beloved features was the addition of playable <a href="https://nookipedia.com/wiki/NES_game">NES games</a>
as rare collectible furniture items.</p>

<p>This feature was implemented by including NES and Famicom Disk System emulators
and the actual game ROMs on the Animal Crossing disk.
The NES emulator included
with Animal Crossing is frequently referenced as being one of the
most accurate NES emulators available, but comes with the requirement
of playing or emulating a GameCube to access the feature.</p>

<h2>Extracting the ROMs</h2>

<p>So if we've archived the Animal Crossing ROM from the physical disk using
CleanRip or the FlippyDrive backup tool,
what can we do to extract the NES and FDS ROM files?</p>

<p>When I went looking for answers, originally I tried tracking
down the exact offsets within the Animal Crossing ROM
using the <a href="https://github.com/ACreTeam/ac-decomp">Animal Crossing decompilation project</a>
as a reference. This turned out to be unnecessary, as I discovered
that the ROM data was likely compressed.</p>

<p>Knowing that the ROM data was compressed, on a hunch I checked
the ROM for all Yaz0-compressed blobs. Yaz0 is commonly used by
Nintendo for compressing assets. Sure enough, the ROMs were all
compressed using Yaz0 which uses a highly identifiable magic string
of "<code>Yaz0</code>".
This meant we could extract all ROM files by decompressing all
Yaz0 blobs and then look for NES and FDS ROM headers.</p>

<p>Below is the entire script I used to archive the NES ROMs from the
Animal Crossing ISO, including an implementation of the <a href="http://www.amnoid.de/gc/yaz0.txt">Yaz0</a>
compression scheme:</p>

Currently I've only tested using the North American copy of Animal Crossing.</p>

<p>These ROMs can now be used just like any other ROM with NES emulators. If you're
playing on desktop and want to try your ROMs out you can use <a href="https://koute.github.io/pinky-web/">Pinky</a>, a WASM-based
NES emulator. If you want to play on mobile I recommend using the <a href="https://delta-emu.com/">Delta emulator</a>.</p>

<p>It feels quite magical to be playing NES games from a childhood copy of Animal Crossing
on a modern iPhone. Wario's Woods was always my favorite, so I look forward to playing
the game more often and keeping that nostalgic connection alive.</p>

<p>If you're looking for more ways to find legal ROMs of games, WULFF DEN <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQNXmOidh1g">published
a video</a> recently linking to a
<a href="https://github.com/farmerbb/RED-Project/wiki#game-compilations">list of other "ROM extraction" methods</a> like this one.</p>

<h2>What if I only have a Game Boy Advance?</h2>

<p>You're in luck! Animal Crossing also had a feature called
"<a href="https://nookipedia.com/wiki/Game_Boy_Advance#Advance_Play">Advance Play</a>"
which meant most NES games could be saved to your GBA via a mode called
"Multiboot" or "Joyboot". Animal Crossing used separate
ROMs that were compiled for the GBA CPU instead of the NES CPU.</p>

<p>These ROMs are detected by looking for the string <code>AGBJ01\x96</code> at offset <code>0xAC</code>, corresponding
to the Game Boy Advance ROM header that was chosen for these ROMs.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> To run these on a GBA emulator or with a GBA flash cartridge you need to
  convert the <code>.mb</code> files into <code>.gba</code> files. <a href="https://gist.github.com/mid-kid/149e7415e5da89cca5e2dd36459eeac5">This script</a> worked for
  converting the files to <code>.gba</code>.</p>
