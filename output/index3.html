            <p>I&rsquo;m pretty much fully back to normal life after PyCon US 2025.</p>

<p>I started writing this post shortly after PyCon, got side-tracked, and now I&rsquo;m finally publishing it.</p>

<p><strong>My very quick recap</strong>: I spent a ton of time at PyCon chatting with folks and I <em>really</em> enjoyed it.
As Ned wrote, <a href="https://nedbatchelder.com/blog/202505/pycon_summer_camp.html">it&rsquo;s like summer camp</a>.</p>

<h2>My pre-conference (Monday and Tuesday)</h2>

<p>I flew in a couple days early (Monday May 12) because Breeze airlines had a non-stop flight from San Diego to Pittsburgh that only ran on Monday or Friday.
I listened to <a href="http://robertdputnam.com/the-upswing/">The Upswing</a> as I flew in and wondered <a href="https://mastodon.social/@treyhunner/114496799621377766">how we can make our community less individualistic</a>.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, I went on <a href="https://mastodon.social/@treyhunner/114495825740774796">a walking tour</a> of downtown Pittsburgh.
Then I ate Indian food for lunch at Sree&rsquo;s, which I chose because I saw they had great vegan lunch options and weren&rsquo;t open for dinner.
I was eating vegan during PyCon US (as I <em>mostly</em> do at home) and I remembered to do <a href="https://mastodon.social/@treyhunner/114506541091205849">some research on vegan dinner restaurants in the area</a> this year.</p>

<p>On Tuesday night, as CPython core devs started showing up in the Westin lobby, I went on a walk with Anthony Shaw.
Anthony asked whether I was up for &ldquo;an adventure&rdquo; and I said yes without asking questions.
We walked across the river to Randyland (a.k.a. &ldquo;the mattress factory&rdquo;).
It was fun, interesting, and quite odd.
We were the only ones there and had plenty of time to look around at all the interesting items and art pieces that Randy had collected.</p>

<p>Anthony and I did dinner at Condado&rsquo;s and ran into more conference friends at the bar (Kattni, Rose, and Kojo).</p>

<h2>My tutorial on decorators (Wednesday)</h2>

<p>Wednesday was my tutorial day.</p>

<p>Attendees used sticky notes during the exercise sections to note when they needed help.
I wrote about this system in my <a href="https://treyhunner.com/2025/05/how-to-give-a-great-pycon-tutorial/">blog post of tips for giving a good PyCon tutorial</a>.</p>

<p>The tutorial went well and the attendees seemed to enjoy it.</p>

<h2>The newcomer&rsquo;s orientation &amp; education summit (Thursday)</h2>

<p>Just before the opening reception on Thursday evening, Kojo, Sumana, and I ran the <a href="https://mastodon.social/@pycon@fosstodon.org/114512798321665686">newcomer&rsquo;s orientation</a>.
Figuring out what exactly we want to say to help orient folks to PyCon is always a bit challenging.
A first-time PyCon attendee gave me some ideas for how we could do it even better next year.
I&rsquo;ve taken notes and will revisit them later.</p>

<p>I also attended a few talks during education summit earlier in the day.
Reuven Lerner gave a talk on how he recommends his students use LLMs and I was pleased to hear many suggestions that are closely aligned with what I recommend as well as a few insights I hadn&rsquo;t heard before.</p>

<h2>My lightning talk (Friday)</h2>

<p>I gave a lightning talk on Friday evening (the first talk day).
I called it <a href="https://youtu.be/Uuhu-F05A7k?feature=shared&amp;t=3174">Systems, gates, and rage</a>.
It seemed to go over well.
Folks occasionally told me throughout the conference that they enjoyed it.
I won&rsquo;t spoil the topic of my lightning talk (you&rsquo;ll need to watch it) but it&rsquo;s a topic that I&rsquo;d been thinking about for a few months.</p>

<p>Rodrigo gave a <a href="https://mastodon.social/@treyhunner/114519939925398070">meta lightning talk</a> as the first talk of the first day.
I gave a meta lightning talk last year in the same slot.
I hope this becomes a tradition, where the first lightning talk is a talk about someone explaining how to give a lightning talk.</p>

<h2>The keynotes</h2>

<p>I really enjoyed the keynotes this year.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/ydVmzg_SJLw?feature=shared">Cory Doctorow&rsquo;s opening keynote</a> was <a href="https://mastodon.social/@treyhunner/114519939925398070"><em>really</em> thought-provoking</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/Bglsof9b23k?feature=shared">Lynn Root&rsquo;s keynote</a> was on the importance <a href="https://mastodon.social/@treyhunner/114519939925398070">of &ldquo;play&rdquo;</a>, which is a topic I&rsquo;ve written about before to my <a href="https://pym.dev/newsletter">mailing list</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/qog-dGVhSBI?feature=shared">The Marshall project</a> keynote and <a href="https://youtu.be/3UOLpTA7pRI?feature=shared">The Carpentries</a> keynote were also great, though I missed portions of each (beginning of one and end of another) and ended up watching the full videos online after the conference.</p>

<h2>The hallway track</h2>

<p>The &ldquo;hallway track&rdquo; is the way many PyCon attendees describe <strong>the discussions that happen organically in the hallway</strong>.</p>

<p>These discussions can happen at any time, including breaks, breakfast, lunch, and even during talks. I missed at least 3 talks this year because I was having a great discussion in the hallway and time got away from me.</p>

<p>PyCon&rsquo;s venue in Pittsburgh included a great <a href="https://mastodon.social/@treyhunner/114512971414412295">rooftop</a> so the <strong>rooftop track</strong> / <strong>garden track</strong> was a lovely spin in the hallway track this year.</p>

<h2>The open spaces</h2>

<p>The open spaces are a very important part of PyCon for me.</p>

<p>Like the hallway track, the open spaces are mostly (usually) about having a conversation.
Unlike the hallway track, the open spaces have a <strong>set topic</strong>.</p>

<p>I attended open spaces (and <a href="https://mastodon.social/@treyhunner/114526876252905533">ran my own</a>):</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Education and Outreach Working Group Open Space</strong>: I&rsquo;m part of this newly revived work group and we held this to hear topics that community members are interested in seeing the PSF focus on more deliberately</li>
<li><strong>t-strings: Let&rsquo;s build powerful templating together</strong>: I am interested in the new t-string feature in Python 3.14 and wanted to listen to this conversation (I contributed <em>a little bit</em> too)</li>
<li><strong>Computer Assisted Reporting and Investigative journalism</strong>: I was curious to hear this conversation, which included journalists, government employees who respond to information requests, and many others</li>
<li><strong>Python Skill-Building</strong>: I ran this open space on the roof during lunch time to chat about different Python skill-building services, including my own (<a href="https://pym.dev">Python Morsels</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Ask a Friendly Meat-Loving Vegan</strong>: I also ran this open space, inspired by a conversation I had the night before in a hotel lobby about animal farming, veganism, nutrition, and other related topics I&rsquo;ve thought/read a lot about</li>
</ul>


<p>I enjoyed meeting folks with similar interests and having fun and productive conversations (or at least listening to interesting conversations) in those open spaces.</p>

<h2>Dinners, games, and hotel lobby conversations</h2>

<p>I ate at Bae Bae&rsquo;s, Rosewater Grill, and APTEKA during the conference.
I also ate at Condado&rsquo;s at least 3 nights.</p>

<p>APTEKA was a fun trek for <a href="https://mastodon.social/@pythonbynight@fosstodon.org/114525581821316666">vegan PierogiCon</a> with mostly non-vegan folks.
I&rsquo;m sure the pierogis weren&rsquo;t authentic, but we all loved the food.</p>

<p>After dinner every night I went to the Westin lobby and either played <a href="https://treyhunner.com/2015/06/cabo-card-game/">the Cabo card game</a> or chatted with folks (<a href="https://mastodon.social/@treyhunner/114509076754402356">1</a>, <a href="https://mastodon.social/@treyhunner/114514682814457694">2</a>, <a href="https://mastodon.social/@treyhunner/114525878624139679">3</a>).</p>

<h2>On missing talks</h2>

<p>The keynotes and lightning talks are usually my favorite parts of PyCon.
I tried to watch as many live keynotes and lightning talk sessions as I could this year.
The morning lightning talks were hard to make it to because I kept sleeping in late enough that I missed most of them.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I watched <em>very few</em> live talks.
I missed talks due to sleeping in, attending open spaces, visiting booths in the exhibit hall, getting lost in conversations in the hallway, and mid-day taking naps (in my hotel room, not during talks!).</p>

<p>Hynek has <a href="https://hynek.me/articles/hallway-track/">written about the downside of the hallway track and the importance of attending talks</a>.
I sympathize with Hynek&rsquo;s argument that the hallway track is a trade off and there are downsides to missing talks, for both attendees and speakers.
I am grateful that folks give talks and I want to support folks who do give talks, and yet, I often find myself attending few talks.</p>

<p>Ironically, the one talk I ended up taking a nap through (again, in my hotel room, not <em>in the talk</em>) was Hynek&rsquo;s.
My brain was fried by the time of his talk and I&rsquo;m glad I was able to watch it online the week after PyCon.
He apparently had a completely packed room as it was!</p>

<p>I did make sure to show up to a talk by a conference friend who I wanted to support (Michael Dahlberg&rsquo;s <a href="https://youtu.be/LseCKvrp6og?feature=shared">talk on honeybee swarms</a>).
I have also binge-watched a dozen or so talks online that I had planned to attend but missed during PyCon.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@PyConUS/videos">watch all talks online now</a> (at least I <em>think</em> they&rsquo;re all up now?).</p>

<h2>Attend a Python event</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to PyCon coming to Long Beach next year.
I&rsquo;m in San Diego and it will be nice to <em>not fly</em> to a PyCon for once!</p>

<p>I highly recommend attending local Python meetups, attending regional Python conferences, and/or attending PyCon US.
Most in-person Python community events are <em>pretty lovely</em>.
The Python community generally goes out of its way to be more welcoming than most tech events.</p>

<p>See you in Long Beach!</p>

<p>Python 3.13 is the newest major release of the Python programming 
language, and it contains many new features and optimizations compared 
to Python 3.12. 3.13.5 is the fifth maintenance release of 3.13.</p>
<p>3.13.5 is an expedited release to fix a couple of significant issues with the 3.13.4 release:</p>
<ul><li><a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/135151">gh-135151</a>: Building extension modules on Windows for the regular (non-free-threaded) build failed.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/135171">gh-135171</a>: Generator expressions stopped raising <code>TypeError</code> (when iterating over non-iterable objects) at creation time, delaying it to first use.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/135326">gh-135326</a>: Passing int-like objects (like <code>numpy.int64</code>) to <code>random.getrandbits()</code> failed, when it worked before.</li></ul>
<p>Several other bug fixes (which would otherwise have waited until the 
next release) are also included. Special thanks to everyone who worked 
hard the last couple of days to fix these issues as quickly as possible.</p>

            If you're looking to leverage the insane power of modern GPUs for data science and ML, you might think you'll need to use some low-level programming language such as C++. But the folks over at NVIDIA have been hard at work building Python SDKs which provide nearly native level of performance when doing Pythonic GPU programming. Bryce Adelstein Lelbach is here to tell us about programming your GPU in pure Python.

            <p>Following the June 4, 2025 security release, the Django team is issuing
releases for
<a class="reference external" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/5.2.3/">Django 5.2.3</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/5.1.11/">Django 5.1.11</a>, and
<a class="reference external" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/4.2.23/">Django 4.2.23</a> to
complete mitigation for CVE-2025-48432: Potential log injection via unescaped
request path (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2025/jun/04/security-releases/">full description</a>).</p>
<p>These follow-up releases migrate remaining response logging paths to a safer
logging implementation, ensuring that all untrusted input is properly escaped
before being written to logs. This update does not introduce a new CVE but
strengthens the original fix.</p>
<p>We encourage all users of Django to upgrade as soon as possible.</p>

<p>تحديد الهدف ليس مجرد خطوة شكلية، بل هو البوصلة التي ستوجه رحلتك التعليمية بأكملها. المبرمجون الناجحون يبدأون برؤية واضحة لما يريدون تحقيقه، مما يساعدهم على:</p>

<ul>

            <p>I've received quite a bit of feedback on the last thing I wrote <a class="reference external" href="http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2025/6/4/changes/">about AI</a>, particularly around the idea that I'm too quick to
brush aside criticism.  Given that Glyph — who I respect a lot — <a class="reference external" href="https://blog.glyph.im/2025/06/i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now.html">wrote a
lengthy piece</a>
on why he's largely opting out of AI with some thoughtfully articulated
criticism, I thought is would be a good opportunity to respond.</p>
<div class="section" id="focusing-on-code">
<h2>Focusing on Code</h2>
<p>For this discussion, I'm focusing on AI as a tool for generating text and
code — not images, video, or music.  My perspective is that there’s a clear
difference between utilitarian outputs (code, simple text) and creative
outputs that are meant to evoke emotion (art, music, well articulated
writings, etc.).  For example, when I get an email from a real estate
broker, I expect clear information, not art.  Similarly, when I add
something to a virtual shopping cart, I don’t care how artistic the code
is that makes it work.  In fact, even today without AI, I better not know.</p>
<p>So, like Glyph, I want to focus on code.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="quality-of-output-and-adoption">
<h2>Quality of Output and Adoption</h2>
<p>If you read my earlier post, you probably picked up that I see a lot of
potential in AI.  That hasn't always been my stance, and I intend to
remain critical, but right now I'm quite positive about its
usefulness.  That is in a stark contrast to Glyph's experience.</p>
<p>He writes:</p>
<blockquote>
My experiences of genAI are all extremely bad, but that is barely even
anecdata. Their experiences are neutral-to-positive. Little scientific
data exists. How to resolve this?</blockquote>
<p>I can't judge Glyph's experiences, and I don't want to speculate about why
they differ from mine.  I've certainly had my own frustrations with AI tools.</p>
<p>The difference, I think, is that I've learned over time how to use these
tools more effectively, and that's led to better results.  For me, it's not
just “neutral-to-positive” — it's been astonishingly positive.  As I write
this, my agent is fixing code in another window for me.  I recorded <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQYXZCUvpIc">a
video of it fixing issues in a library</a> if you want to see what
this looks like.</p>
<p>Glyph also argues that adoption is being forced by management and that
people would not voluntarily use it:</p>
<blockquote>
Despite this plethora of negative experiences, executives are
aggressively mandating the use of AI6. It looks like without such
mandates, most people will not bother to use such tools, so the executives
will need muscular policies to enforce its use.7</blockquote>
<p>This doesn't match what I've seen. In my experience, people are adopting
AI on their own, often before their companies are even aware.</p>
<p>Even at Sentry the adoption of AI happened by employees before the company
even put money behind it.  In fact my memory is that if anything only at
the point where an exceeding number of AI invoices showed up from IC
expenses did we realize how widespread adoption has been.  This was
entirely grounds up.  For my non techy friends they sometimes need to hide
their AI usage from their employers because some companies try to prevent
the adoption of AI, but they are paying for it themselves to help them
with the work.  Some of them pay for the expensive ChatGPT subscription
even!</p>
<p>Yes, there are companies like Shopify that put AI on their banners and are
mandating this, but there are probably many more companies that leverage
AI via a secret grassroots adoption.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="enjoying-programming">
<h2>Enjoying Programming</h2>
<p>Glyph makes the point that LLMs reduce code review to a non enjoyable
part.  For me code review is a fact of life and part of the job.  That's
just what we do as programmers.  I don't do it because I want the person
that wrote the code to grow and become a better programmer, I do it
because I want code to be merged.  That does not mean I do not care about
the career opportunities or skills of the other person, I do!  But that's
an effort all on its own.  Sometimes it takes place in a code review, most
of the time however that's happening in a one-on-one setting.  The reality
is that we're often not in the mindset of wanting personal growth when
receiving review comments either.</p>
<p>Now I admit that I do a lot more code review than I do programming at the
moment, but I also find it quite enjoyable.  On the one hand because the
novelty of a machine programming hasn't worn off yet, on the other hand
because it's a very patient recipient of feedback and change requests.
You just tell it stuff, you don't spend too much time to think about how
the other person is going to respond, if it's a good idea to nitpick a
small thing and put extra load on them.  It's quite freeing really and it
does have a different feeling to me than a regular code review.</p>
<p>So is programming still enjoyable if I don't hit the keys?  For me, yes. I
still write code, just less of it, and it doesn't diminish the
satisfaction at all.  I'm still in control, and the quality still depends
on the effort I put into guiding the tool.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="energy-climate-and-stealing">
<h2>Energy, Climate and Stealing</h2>
<p>Glyph doesn't talk too much about the economics and the climate impact,
but he does mention it.  My stance on this is rather simple: margins will
erode, there will be a lot of competition and we all will pay for the
inference necessary and someone will make money.  Energy usage will go up
but we need more energy even without AI as we're electrifying our cars.
AI might change this trajectory slightly, but we had a climate problem
before all of this and we have give or take the same climate problem until
we shift towards more renewable energy.  In fact, this new increased
energy consumption might actually do us a great service here.  Solar is
already the cheapest energy solution <a class="footnote-reference" href="http://lucumr.pocoo.org/feed.atom#footnote-1" id="footnote-reference-1">[1]</a> on the market and if we need
more, that's quite likely the source that we will build more of.
Particularly now that cost of energy storage is also going down quickly.</p>
<p>As for copyright and “stealing”: I've always felt that copyright terms are
too long, scraping is beneficial, and sharing knowledge is a net positive
for humanity.  That's what drew me to Open Source in the first place.  Glyph
argues that scrapers are more aggressive now, but I'm not sure if that is
actually true.  I think there are just more of them.  We got so used that
it was mostly a handful of search engines scraping lowering the cost of it
to all.  I tend to think that more competition is good here and we might
just have to accept it for a little while.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="educational-impact">
<h2>Educational Impact</h2>
<p>I addressed this in my previous article, but I believe LLMs have
significant potential to improve learning.  Glyph disagrees, partly because
of concerns about cheating and that it will make it worse:</p>
<blockquote>
LLMs are making academic cheating incredibly rampant. […] For learning,
genAI is a forklift at the gym. […] But it was within those
inefficiencies and the inconveniences of the academic experience that real
learning <em>was</em>, against all odds, still happening in schools.</blockquote>
<p>I disagree strongly here.  This is where I have the most first-hand
experience, considering time spent with AI.  Since the early days of
ChatGPT, I've used LLMs extensively for learning.  That's because I'm not
great at learning from books, and I have found LLMs to make the process
much more enjoyable and helpful to me.</p>
<p>To give you some ideas of how useful this can be, here is an excellent
prompt that <a class="reference external" href="https://x.com/darin_gordon/status/1931281773490557021">Darin Gordon shared</a> for getting a
GPT to act as a teacher of algorithms that uses the Socratic method:
<a class="reference external" href="https://gist.github.com/Dowwie/5a66cd8df639e4c98043fc7f507dab9e">socratic_fp_learning.md</a>.  It
works even super well if you dumb it down.  I had this explain to my son
how hash tables work and I did a modification to the prompt to help him
understand entropy.  It's surprisingly effective.</p>
<p>Now, that does not do much about the cheating part.  But surely in a
situation where students cheat, it wasn't about learning in the first
case, it was about passing a test.  That has not much to do with learning,
but with performance assessment.  When you feel the need to cheat, you
probably did not learn something properly in the first place.  AI might
just make these pre-existing problems more visible, and even Glyph
acknowledged that.</p>
<p>AI may complicate things for educators in the near team, but it can also
offer real improvements.  Either way, education needs reform to adapt to
present realities.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="fatigue-and-surrender">
<h2>Fatigue and Surrender</h2>
<p>Glyph concludes by sharing that the pace of change is overwhelming him and
opting out feels like the only sane response.   I understand that.  The
pace of AI advancement can make anyone feel like they're falling behind
and I too feel like that sometimes.</p>
<p>I offer a different view: just assume AI will win out and we will see
agents!  Then the path that takes us to that future is less relevant.
Many of the things that are currently asking for people's attention are
going to look different in a few years — or might not even exist any
longer.  I initially used GitHub Copilot just to move to Cursor, now to
mostly move to Claude Code, maybe I will be back with Cursor's background
agents in a month.  First there was v0, then there was lovable, who knows
what there be in a year.  But the path for me is pretty clear: it's going
towards <em>me working together with the machine</em>.  I find that thought very
calming and it takes out the stress.  Taking a positive view gives you a
form of an excited acceptance of the future.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="in-closing">
<h2>In Closing</h2>
<p>I really don't want to dismiss anyone's concerns.  I just feel that, for
me, the utility of these tools has become obvious enough that I don't feel
the need to argue or justify my choices anymore.</p>

        </div>

        <!-- Content Section -->
        <div class="p-4 flex-grow overflow-hidden">
          <p class="text-base-content">
            <p>The Django Software Foundation is announcing a call for Django Fellow applications. A Django Fellow is a contractor, paid by the Django Software Foundation, who dedicates time to maintain the Django framework.</p>
<p>The Fellowship program was started in 2014 as a way to dedicate high-quality and consistent resources to the maintenance of Django. The Django Software Foundation currently supports two Fellows –Natalia Bidart and Sarah Boyce– and has approved funding for a new full-time Fellow. This position will be initially for a period of one year, but may be extended depending on fundraising levels.</p>
<p>Beyond keeping Django running, a fellow is a representative of Django itself. They embody the welcoming culture of Django and aid the community to progress the framework. Fellows are often called upon to speak at Django conferences and events.</p>
<p>They are also usually leading Django Sprints occurring in conferences or other setups. Hence a Django Fellow often engages in both informal and formal mentorship.</p>
<h4 id="s-responsibilities">Responsibilities</h4>
<p>Fellow duties include (but are not limited to):</p>
<ul>
<li>Monitoring security reports and ensuring security issues are acknowledged and responded to promptly</li>
<li>Fixing release blockers and helping to backport fixes to these and security issues</li>
<li>Ensure timely releases including being a release manager for a new version of Django</li>
<li>Triaging tickets on Trac</li>
<li>Reviewing and merging pull requests</li>
<li>Answering contributor questions on the Forum</li>
<li>Helping new Django contributors land patches and learn our philosophy</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="s-requirements">Requirements</h4>
<p>A Django fellow reviews a very large amount of Django contributions. This requires knowledge in every aspect of web development that the Django framework touches. This turns out to be an intimidatingly-large list of technical topics, many of which are listed below. <strong>It’s not our expectation that you come into the job knowing everything on this list! </strong>We hope you’ll have solid experience in a few of these topics, particularly some of the “core” technologies important to Django (Python, relational databases, HTTP). But <strong>we fully expect that you’ll learn most of this on the job</strong>. <strong>A willingness to learn, and a demonstrated history of doing so, is more important than comprehensive knowledge.</strong> </p>
<p>The technical topics you can expect to work on  includes (and is not limited to):</p>
<ul>
<li>SQL and Databases: SQLite, MySQL, Postgres, Oracle</li>
<li>Technical Documentation</li>
<li>Javascript</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>Semantic HTML</li>
<li>Accessibility</li>
<li>UI/UX design (Web and CLI)</li>
<li>Python async </li>
<li>Python features (and versions), compatibility matrix, etc.</li>
<li>Everything around HTTP</li>
<li>Security best practices</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also:</p>
<ul>
<li>Complex processes which need adhering to</li>
<li>Multiple discussions which need opinions and direction</li>
<li>Requirements for both formal and informal mentorship</li>
</ul>
<p>And required professional skills such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conflict resolution</li>
<li>Time management and prioritization expertise</li>
<li>Ability to focus in short periods of time and do substantial context switches</li>
<li>Self-awareness to recognize their own limits and reach out for help</li>
<li>Relationship-building and coordination with Django teams, working groups, and potentially external parties.</li>
<li>Tenacity, patience, compassion and empathy are essential</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore a Django Fellow requires the skills and knowledge of a senior generalist engineer with extensive experience in Python and Django. Open source experience, especially in contributing to Django, is a big plus.</p>
<p>Being a Django contributor isn't a prerequisite for this position — we can help get you up to speed. We'll consider applications from anyone with a proven history of working with either the Django community or another similar open-source community. While no geographical location is required, we have a slight preference for timezones between around -8 and +3 UTC to allow for better working hours to overlap the current fellows.</p>
<p>If you're interested in applying for the position, please email us at <a href="mailto:fellowship-committee@djangoproject.com">fellowship-committee@djangoproject.com</a> describing why you would be a good fit along with details of your relevant experience and community involvement. Lastly, please include at least one recommendation.</p>
<p>The current hourly rate for a fellow is $82.26 USD.</p>
<p>Applicants will be evaluated based on the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>Details of Django and/or other open-source contributions</li>
<li>Details of community support in general</li>
<li>Understanding of the position</li>
<li>Clarity, formality, and precision of communications</li>
<li>Strength of recommendation(s)</li>
</ul>
<p>Applications will be open until midnight AoE, 1 July, 2025, with the expectation that the successful candidate will start around August 1, 2025.</p>
          </p>

            <p>عندما يُذكر الربح من البرمجة، فإن أول ما يتبادر إلى الذهن هو العمل الحر أو التوظيف في شركة تقنية. لكن الحقيقة أن البرمجة تفتح أمامك آفاقًا أوسع بكثير من ذلك. في هذا المقال، سنستعرض مجموعة من الطرق العملية التي يمكن من خلالها <strong>تحويل مهاراتك البرمجية إلى مصادر دخل متعددة</strong>، بعضها غير معروف أو غير مستغل بشكل كافٍ.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="1--بيع-أدوات-برمجية-بسيطة-كمنتجات-رقمية">1. 🧾 بيع أدوات برمجية بسيطة كمنتجات رقمية</h2>

<p>ليست كل الأدوات البرمجية المعروضة للبيع تطبيقات معقدة. يمكن لسكريبت بسيط، أو أداة تحويل بيانات، أو نموذج جاهز لمشروع معين أن يكون مطلوبًا.</p>

<p><strong>أمثلة:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>سكريبت لتحويل ملفات CSV إلى JSON.</li>
  <li>قالب جاهز لإنشاء موقع شخصي بلغة HTML/CSS.</li>
  <li>أداة ويب بسيطة لحساب أسعار العملات أو الضرائب.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>منصات البيع:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://gumroad.com">Gumroad</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://ko-fi.com">Ko-fi</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://itch.io">Itch.io</a> – حتى لأدوات بسيطة.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="2--بيع-المعرفة-بصيغة-منظمة">2. 📚 بيع المعرفة بصيغة منظمة</h2>

<p>إن كنت تجيد الشرح أو تحب توثيق خطوات الحلول البرمجية، يمكنك جمعها في <strong>كتيّب PDF</strong> أو <strong>سلسلة شروحات</strong> وبيعها كمنتج رقمي.</p>

<p><strong>أفكار:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>“30 Snippet بلغة Python لكل مبرمج مبتدئ”.</li>
  <li>دليل شامل لتهيئة بيئة العمل في Node.js.</li>
  <li>شرح مفصل لمفاهيم Git للمبتدئين.</li>
</ul>

<p>لا تحتاج إلى تصوير فيديوهات أو إنشاء منصة كاملة. مجرد ملف PDF منظم قد يكون كافيًا.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="3--التخصص-في-النيتش-niche-البرمجي">3. 🎯 التخصص في النيتش (Niche) البرمجي</h2>

<p>اختر مجالًا فرعيًا ضيقًا داخل البرمجة – مثل إضافات المتصفحات، أو واجهات سطر الأوامر، أو الحوسبة السحابية للمبتدئين – وابدأ ببناء منتجات أو محتوى مدفوع يخدم هذا الجمهور المتخصص.</p>

<p><strong>الميزة:</strong>
سهولة بناء جمهور صغير لكنه وفيّ، مع فرص بيع عالية.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="4--تقديم-خدمات-دقيقة-microservices">4. 🎁 تقديم خدمات دقيقة (Microservices)</h2>

<p>بدلاً من تقديم خدمات عامة كـ”مطور ويب”، فكّر بتقديم خدمات دقيقة جدًا:</p>

<ul>
  <li>تركيب Google Analytics لموقع معين.</li>
  <li>تحسين سرعة تحميل موقع Shopify.</li>
  <li>إعداد سيرفر Nginx لموقع ووردبريس.</li>
</ul>

<p>يمكنك عرض هذه الخدمات على منصات مثل <a href="https://fiverr.com">Fiverr</a> أو حتى في ملفك الشخصي على GitHub مع نموذج طلب مباشر.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="5--إنشاء-موارد-تعليمية-مدفوعة">5. 💡 إنشاء موارد تعليمية مدفوعة</h2>

<p>تجربة شخصية أو مشروع صغير يمكن أن يتحول إلى <strong>مصدر تعليمي مدفوع</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>تسجيل شروحات مصغّرة وبيعها كدروس قصيرة.</li>
  <li>إنشاء دورة تفاعلية بلغة HTML + JS بدون فيديو.</li>
  <li>تصميم تمارين تفاعلية للمبتدئين في البرمجة.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="6--المشاركة-في-مسابقات-وتحديات-برمجية">6. 📊 المشاركة في مسابقات وتحديات برمجية</h2>

<p>بعض المنصات توفر جوائز مالية للمشاريع المفتوحة أو الحلول البرمجية:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://devpost.com">Devpost</a>: مسابقات مفتوحة في الذكاء الاصطناعي، الويب، وغيرها.</li>
  <li><a href="https://kaggle.com">Kaggle</a>: تحديات تحليل بيانات بمكافآت مالية.</li>
  <li><a href="https://topcoder.com">TopCoder</a>: مسابقات في الخوارزميات وتطوير البرمجيات.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="خاتمة-لا-تحصر-خياراتك-في-المسار-التقليدي">خاتمة: لا تحصر خياراتك في المسار التقليدي</h2>

<p>البرمجة ليست فقط أداة لتأدية مهام وظيفية، بل وسيلة لإنشاء قيمة يمكن تحويلها إلى دخل مباشر أو غير مباشر. من خلال التفكير بطريقة مختلفة واستهداف حاجات حقيقية، يمكنك تحويل حتى المهارات البسيطة إلى مصادر دخل مستمرة.</p>

<p>🚀 <em>ابدأ بمشروع صغير، اختبر السوق، وتعلّم مما تفعله… فقد يكون ذلك بداية لمصدر دخل جديد لم تتوقعه.</em></p>

            <p><strong>🌐 لماذا تحتاج إلى موقع إلكتروني شخصي اليوم؟</strong></p>

<p>في العصر الرقمي الحالي، أصبح امتلاك موقع إلكتروني شخصي ليس مجرد ترف، بل ضرورة لأي شخص يريد أن يثبت حضوره في العالم الرقمي، سواء كان:</p>

<ul>
  <li>مطورًا أو مصممًا</li>
  <li>كاتب محتوى أو صانع فيديوهات</li>
  <li>مستقلًا يبحث عن عملاء</li>
  <li>طالبًا أو باحثًا يريد عرض أعماله</li>
</ul>

<p>الموقع الإلكتروني هو سيرتك الذاتية الحية، وملفك المهني، ومحفظتك (Portfolio)، ومنصتك الخاصة التي لا يتحكم فيها خوارزميات شبكات التواصل.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>💡 فوائد امتلاك موقع شخصي:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>احترافية أعلى:</strong> بدلاً من مشاركة روابط LinkedIn أو Behance فقط، يمكنك مشاركة رابط موقعك الذي يحتوي على كل شيء.</li>
  <li><strong>تحسين ظهورك في محركات البحث (SEO):</strong> موقعك يعطيك فرصة للظهور عندما يبحث الناس عن اسمك أو تخصصك.</li>
  <li><strong>بناء علامة شخصية:</strong> يمكنك التحكم في تصميم وأسلوب موقعك ليعكس شخصيتك وأهدافك.</li>
  <li><strong>تجميع كل أعمالك:</strong> بدلًا من روابط متفرقة، كل أعمالك وسيرتك ومشاريعك ستكون في مكان واحد.</li>
  <li><strong>التحكم الكامل:</strong> لا قيود، لا إعلانات من طرف ثالث، ولا خطر من حذف المحتوى.</li>

<h3 id="-الخيار-الأول-موصى-به-الحصول-على-دومين-مدفوع-مجانًا-من-onamae">🎯 الخيار الأول (موصى به): الحصول على دومين مدفوع مجانًا من onamae</h3>

<p>موقع <a href="https://onamae.com">onamae.com</a> الياباني يقدم أحيانًا عروضًا للحصول على **دومينات .com و .net وغيرها مجانًا  **.</p>

<h4 id="خطوات-التسجيل">خطوات التسجيل:</h4>

<ol>
  <li>ادخل إلى <a href="https://onamae.com">https://onamae.com</a></li>
  <li>الموقع باليابانية، لكن متصفح <strong>Chrome يترجم الصفحات تلقائيًا</strong>. إن لم تظهر الترجمة:</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>اضغط بزر الفأرة الأيمن على الصفحة واختر <strong>“Translate to English”</strong> (أو العربية حسب اللغة).</li>
  <li>أو فعّل الترجمة من إعدادات Chrome &gt; اللغات &gt; “عرض الترجمة عند زيارة صفحات بلغة مختلفة”.
    <ol>
      <li>ابحث عن اسم نطاق متاح.</li>
      <li>أتم التسجيل.</li>
      <li>احصل على إعدادات DNS الخاصة بالنطاق، سنحتاجها لاحقًا لربط النطاق بـ GitHub Pages.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3 id="-البديل-استخدام-نطاق-فرعي-مجاني-واحترافي">🔄 البديل: استخدام نطاق فرعي مجاني واحترافي</h3>

<p>إذا لم ينجح تسجيل الدومين على onamae، لا تقلق! لا تزال هناك خيارات ممتازة للحصول على نطاق فرعي مجاني ذو جودة عالية:</p>

<h4 id="-vercel">🔹 Vercel:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>يعطيك نطاقًا مثل: <code class="highlighter-rouge">yourname.vercel.app</code></li>
  <li>مثالي لتطبيقات React, Next.js وغيرها</li>
  <li>يدعم الربط مع GitHub تلقائيًا</li>
</ul>

            If you've heard the phrase "Automate the boring things" for Python, this episode starts with that idea and takes it to another level. We have Glyph back on the podcast to talk about "Programming YOUR computer with Python." We dive into a bunch of tools and frameworks and especially spend some time on integrating with existing platform APIs (e.g. macOS's BrowserKit and Window's COM APIs) to build desktop apps in Python that make you happier and more productive. Let's dive in!
