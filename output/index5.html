            <p style="text-align: left;"><span><span style="font-family: inherit;">PyCon US is the largest and longest-running annual gathering for the community using and developing the open-source Python programming language. It is produced and underwritten by the <a href="https://www.python.org/psf-landing/">Python Software Foundation</a> (PSF), the 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing and promoting Python and its community.</span></span></p><p style="text-align: left;"><span><span style="font-family: inherit;">The PSF is a grant-giving non-profit and the revenue generated by PyCon US is essential to our continued community support and operations. Check out our <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/mission/">Mission</a> and our <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/annual-report/2023/">latest Annual Impact Report</a> to get an idea of the scope of work our foundation is responsible for. Many misunderstand or are unaware of this relationship, but the PSF relies on maintaining a strict budget for the operation of PyCon US in order to continue its grants programs and other financial responsibilities.</span></span></p><p style="text-align: left;"><span><span style="font-family: inherit;">With this in mind, PyCon US has taken on many expenses in the years following the pandemic, including the losses associated with canceling PyCon US 2020 and the move to PyCon US 2021 online. Additionally, inflation in event costs and lower projected sponsorships have combined to create a significant loss for PyCon US and the PSF in 2024.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p style="text-align: left;"><span><span style="font-family: inherit;">Because the PSF is a nonprofit, we keep PyCon US registration costs much lower than comparable technology conferences. Our goal is for PyCon US to remain accessible to the widest group possible. For us to continue to do so and ensure the sustainability of the event, we’ve had to make some changes to the structure of PyCon US. We know that an important piece of making changes to PyCon US is notice and awareness to our wonderful community– and we want to be transparent about the reasons behind them.&nbsp;</span></span></p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Ticket Prices</h3><p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">To continue providing the content, program, and opportunities of PyCon US this year and in the future and to offset these rising costs, we’ve decided to raise ticket prices this year by $50 USD for the Individual and Corporate rates and $25 USD for the Student rate.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span><span style="font-family: inherit;">New PyCon US 2025 registration prices:&nbsp;</span></span></p><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li><span><span style="font-family: inherit;">Corporate: $800 USD</span></span></li><li><span style="font-family: inherit;">Individual: $450 USD</span></li><li><span style="font-family: inherit;">Student: $125 USD</span></li></ul><p></p><p><span><span style="font-family: inherit;">By adjusting ticket prices, we hope to continue delivering a valuable and enriching conference experience while still being financially accessible to our community.&nbsp;</span></span></p><h3 style="text-align: left;">PyCon US Online</h3><p style="text-align: left;"><span><span style="font-family: inherit;">PyCon US moved to online for the first year in 2021 during the pandemic and we’ve been proud to offer the Online attendance option for the past three years since. While we recognize the value that PyCon US Online provides in terms of accessibility, the challenges of delivering a seamless and engaging experience for both in-person and virtual attendees have been significant. From a cost perspective alone, cutting the online event will free up resources that can be put back into the in person and after-conference experience.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p style="text-align: left;"><span><span style="font-family: inherit;">PyCon US will record all Talk tracks, Keynotes and Lightning Talks on the main days of the conference (Friday - Sunday) and we plan to publish these recordings very quickly after the sessions take place so those who can’t join us in person can access them while the topics are still current.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p style="text-align: left;"><span><span style="font-family: inherit;">We appreciate the enthusiasm and participation of everyone who was part of the PyCon US Online experience and encourage everyone who can to join us in person in Pittsburgh this year. If you are unable to join, we welcome you to subscribe to our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/pyconus">PyCon US YouTube channel</a> to receive notifications of new content.</span></span></p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Tutorial Recordings</h3><p><span><span style="font-family: inherit;">The pre-conference tutorials are a valuable part of the PyCon US conference and provide an opportunity for Pythonistas around the world to learn and grow their skills in hands-on sessions.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span><span style="font-family: inherit;">Tutorial ticket sales are a large source of revenue for PyCon US, but in the past few years, the margin on the tutorials has declined due to rising costs associated with recording these sessions.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span><span style="font-family: inherit;">Because tutorials are longer than talks and are in an interactive classroom-like setting, they require many resources such as power, better internet connectivity, and catering. Additionally, tutorial instructors are compensated due to the amount of work involved in preparing and providing these sessions.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span><span style="font-family: inherit;">Since tutorial registration is at an additional cost, we want to prioritize the experience for those attending in person and to do so, we will be removing tutorial recordings this year. The value of the face-to-face learning, discussions, and hands-on engagement that occurs during the tutorials outweighs the benefits of capturing the sessions for later viewing and can’t be replicated in a recorded format. We hope this change will encourage more attendees to participate in the tutorials onsite and engage with the content the instructors work very hard to provide.&nbsp;</span></span></p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Speaker Travel Grant Limit</h3><p><span><span style="font-family: inherit;">The support of our community has allowed us to offer generous Travel Grants based on individual needs including travel, accommodation, and conference tickets. The Travel Grant program helps us shape a conference that is diverse on a number of axes from technical to geographic.</span></span></p><p><span><span style="font-family: inherit;">However, <a href="https://pycon.blogspot.com/2024/03/TravelGrantsReport2024.html">with decreased Travel Grant funds</a>, PyCon US wants to ensure that we can still spread out our funding to support as many people as possible. Currently, a large part of the Travel Grant budget goes to speakers, and all speakers who are included on the proposal for an accepted talk are automatically eligible for a travel grant. For 2025, there will be a limit of two Travel Grant-funded speakers per accepted proposal across all tracks. We believe this will allow us to spread our funding capacity across our community and welcome as many Pythonistas to PyCon US as we can, while not impacting the quality and diversity of our programming.</span></span></p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Thank you!</h3><p><span><span style="font-family: inherit;">PyCon US has been around for over 20 years, and we want to ensure it sticks around for many more! We recognize that these changes will impact many folks in a variety of ways, and we hope that our transparency about why these decisions were made will help bring understanding.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span><span style="font-family: inherit;">By making these changes and being willing to adapt, PyCon US can continue to be a welcoming, community conference, where everyone can meet new people and learn new things, connect with old friends and tell people about their projects. We appreciate our community’s support and understanding regarding these changes. If you have any feedback or questions, please feel free to <a href="mailto:pycon-reg@python.org">reach out to the organizing team</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>

            <p>There has been a longstanding gap in the Python packaging ecosystem that has
somewhat annoyed me,
but not enough to do anything about it:
we haven't really had a good way to compose <em>multiple</em> layers of Python
virtual environments together,
allowing large dependencies (like AI and machine learning libraries)
to be shared across multiple different application environments without having
to install them directly into the base runtime environment.</p>
<p>Utilities for collecting up an entire Python runtime, an application, and all its
dependencies into a single deployable artifact have existed since before the turn
of the century.</p>
<p>We've had standardised <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html">virtual environments</a>
(allowing multiple applications to share a base Python runtime and its directly
installed third party packages) for almost as long.</p>
<p>We've had <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipapp.html">zip applications</a>
for a long time as well (and other utilities which build on that feature).</p>
<p>We've had tools like <a href="https://github.com/cloudify-cosmo/wagon"><code>wagon</code></a>
which allow us to ship a bundle of prebuilt Python wheel archives and
install them on a destination system without needing to download
anything else from the internet at installation time.</p>
<p>We've had tools like <a href="https://docs.conda.io/"><code>conda</code></a>
(and more recently <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/"><code>uv</code></a>),
which make intelligent use of hard links on local systems to avoid
making duplicate copies of completely identical versions of packages.</p>
<p>We've technically had platform specific mechanisms like Linux container images,
where the contents of an environment can be built up across multiple
container image layers, with the lower layers being shared across multiple
image definitions, but have lacked a convenient way to handle the dependency
management complications involved in using these tools to share large Python
libraries.</p>
<p>But we've never had something which specifically took full advantage of the way
Python's import system works to enable robust structural decomposition of Python
applications into independently updatable subcomponents (with a granularity
larger than single packages).</p>
<p>All of this history meant that I was thoroughly intrigued when a mutual
acquaintance introduced me to the creators of the <a href="https://lmstudio.ai/">LM Studio</a>
personal AI desktop application to discuss a Python packaging problem they
had looming on their technical road map: it was clear from user demand and the
rate of evolution in the Python AI/ML ecosystem that they needed a way to ship
Python AI/ML components directly to their users <em>without</em> having to wait for
those capabilities to be made available through native interfaces in other
languages (such as Swift, C++, or JavaScript), but it didn't seem obvious to them
<em>how</em> they could readily integrate that capability into LM Studio without
making the application installation process substantially more complicated
for their users.</p>
<p>What started as a consulting contract for a technical proof of concept,
and has since turned into a permanent position with the organisation,
proved fruitful,
and the result is the <a href="https://lmstudio.ai/blog/venvstacks">recently published</a>
open source <a href="https://pypi.org/project/venvstacks/"><code>venvstacks</code></a> utility,
which is specifically designed to enable the kind of portable deterministic
artifact publishing setup that LM Studio needed, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Base runtime layers
  (based on <a href="https://github.com/indygreg/python-build-standalone"><code>python-build-standalone</code></a>)</li>
<li>Framework layers (for shipping large dependencies, such as Apple MLX or PyTorch)</li>
<li>Application layers (including additional unpackaged "launch modules" for app execution)</li>
</ul>
<p>There are certainly still some technical limitations to be addressed (the
<a href="https://github.com/lmstudio-ai/venvstacks/issues/38">dynamic linking problem</a>
with layering virtual environments like this is notorious amongst Python packaging
experts for a reason), but even in its current form, <code>venvstacks</code> is already capable
enough to power the recent inclusion of
<a href="https://lmstudio.ai/blog/lmstudio-v0.3.4#mlx-in-lm-studio-using-python">Apple MLX support</a>
in LM Studio.</p>

            In this tutorial, you'll learn about Python closures. A closure is a function-like object with an extended scope. You can use closures to create decorators, factory functions, stateful functions, and more.

            <p><a href="https://woodruffw.github.io/zizmor/" rel="external noopener">Zizmor</a> is a new tool to
check your GitHub action workflows for security concerns.  I found it really
helpful to lock down actions.</p><p>Action workflows can be esoteric, and continuous integration is not
everyone&#8217;s top concern, so it&#8217;s easy for them to have subtle flaws.  A tool like
zizmor is great for drawing attention to them.</p><p>When I ran it, I had a few issues to fix:</p><ul>

<li>Some data available to actions is manipulable by unknown people, so you have
to avoid interpolating it directly into shell commands.  For example, you might
want to add the branch name to the action summary:

<blockquote class="code"><pre class="python"><div class="source"><span class="o">-</span>&#xa0;<span class="n">name</span><span class="p">:</span>&#xa0;<span class="s2">&quot;Summarize&quot;</span>
<br />&#xa0;&#xa0;<span class="n">run</span><span class="p">:</span>&#xa0;<span class="o">|</span>
<br />&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;<span class="n">echo</span>&#xa0;<span class="s2">&quot;###&#xa0;From&#xa0;branch&#xa0;${{&#xa0;github.ref&#xa0;}}&quot;</span>&#xa0;<span class="o">&gt;&gt;</span>&#xa0;<span class="err">$</span><span class="n">GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY</span>
<br /></div>
</pre></blockquote>

But <code>github.ref</code> is a branch name chosen by the author of the pull request.
It could have a shell injection which could let an attacker exfiltrate secrets.
Instead, put the value into an environment variable, then use it to interpolate:

<blockquote class="code"><pre class="python"><div class="source"><span class="o">-</span>&#xa0;<span class="n">name</span><span class="p">:</span>&#xa0;<span class="s2">&quot;Summarize&quot;</span>
<br />&#xa0;&#xa0;<span class="n">env</span><span class="p">:</span>
<br />&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;<span class="n">REF</span><span class="p">:</span>&#xa0;<span class="err">$</span><span class="p">{{</span>&#xa0;<span class="n">github</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">ref</span>&#xa0;<span class="p">}}</span>
<br />&#xa0;&#xa0;<span class="n">run</span><span class="p">:</span>&#xa0;<span class="o">|</span>
<br />&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;<span class="n">echo</span>&#xa0;<span class="s2">&quot;###&#xa0;From&#xa0;branch&#xa0;$</span><span class="si">{REF}</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span>&#xa0;<span class="o">&gt;&gt;</span>&#xa0;<span class="err">$</span><span class="n">GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY</span>
<br /></div>
</pre></blockquote>

</li>

<li>The actions/checkout step should avoid persisting credentials:

<blockquote class="code"><pre class="yaml"><div class="source"><span class="p p-Indicator">-</span><span class="w">&#xa0;</span><span class="nt">name</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w">&#xa0;</span><span class="s">&quot;Check</span><span class="nv">&#xa0;</span><span class="s">out</span><span class="nv">&#xa0;</span><span class="s">the</span><span class="nv">&#xa0;</span><span class="s">repo&quot;</span>
<br /><span class="w">&#xa0;&#xa0;</span><span class="nt">uses</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w">&#xa0;</span><span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">actions/checkout@11bd71901bbe5b1630ceea73d27597364c9af683</span><span class="w">&#xa0;</span><span class="c1">#&#xa0;v4.2.2</span>
<br /><span class="w">&#xa0;&#xa0;</span><span class="nt">with</span><span class="p">:</span>
<br /><span class="w">&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;</span><span class="nt">persist-credentials</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w">&#xa0;</span><span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">false</span>
<br /></div>
</pre></blockquote>

</li>

<li>In steps where I was pushing to GitHub, this meant I needed to explicitly
set a remote URL with credentials:

<blockquote class="code"><pre class="yaml"><div class="source"><span class="p p-Indicator">-</span><span class="w">&#xa0;</span><span class="nt">name</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w">&#xa0;</span><span class="s">&quot;Push</span><span class="nv">&#xa0;</span><span class="s">digests</span><span class="nv">&#xa0;</span><span class="s">to</span><span class="nv">&#xa0;</span><span class="s">pages&quot;</span>

<br /><span class="w">&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;</span><span class="nt">GITHUB_TOKEN</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w">&#xa0;</span><span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">${{&#xa0;secrets.token&#xa0;}}</span>
<br /><span class="w">&#xa0;&#xa0;</span><span class="nt">run</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w">&#xa0;</span><span class="p p-Indicator">|</span>
<br /><span class="w">&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;</span><span class="no">git&#xa0;config&#xa0;user.name&#xa0;nedbat</span>
<br /><span class="w">&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;</span><span class="no">git&#xa0;config&#xa0;user.email&#xa0;ned@nedbatchelder.com</span>
<br /><span class="w">&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;</span><span class="no">git&#xa0;remote&#xa0;set-url&#xa0;origin&#xa0;https://x-access-token:${GITHUB_TOKEN}@github.com/${GITHUB_REPOSITORY}.git</span>
<br /></div>
</pre></blockquote>

</li>

</ul><p>There were some other things that were easy to fix, and of course, you might
have other issues.  One improvement to zizmor: it could link to explanations of
how to fix the problems it finds, but it wasn&#8217;t hard to find resources, like
<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/security-hardening-for-github-actions" rel="external noopener">GitHub&#8217;s Security hardening for GitHub Actions</a>.</p><p>William Woodruff is zizmor&#8217;s author.  He was incredibly responsive when I had
problems or questions about using zizmor.  If you hit a snag, write an
<a href="https://github.com/woodruffw/zizmor/issues" rel="external noopener">issue</a>.  It will be a
good experience.</p><p>If you are like me, you have repos lying around that you don&#8217;t think about
much.  These are a special concern, because their actions could be years old,
and not well maintained.  These dusty corners could be a good vector for an
attack.  So I wanted to check all of my repos.</p><p>With <a href="https://claude.ai" rel="external noopener">Claude&#8217;s help</a> I wrote a shell script
to find all git repos I own and run zizmor on them. It checks the owner of the
repo because my drive is littered with git repos I have no control over:</p><blockquote class="code"><pre class="bash"><div class="source"><span class="ch">#!/bin/bash</span>

        <div class="p-4 flex-grow overflow-hidden">
          <p class="text-base-content">
            <p>Most software that exists today does not forget.  Creating software that
remembers is easy, but designing software that deliberately “forgets” is
a bit more complex.  By “forgetting,” I don't mean losing data because it
wasn’t saved or losing it randomly due to bugs.  I'm referring to making a
deliberate design decision to discard data at a later time.  This ability
to forget can be an incredibly benefitial property for many applications.
Most importantly software that forgets enables different user experiences.</p>
<p>I'm willing to bet that your cloud storage or SaaS applications likely
serve as dumping grounds for outdated, forgotten files and artifacts.
This doesn’t have to be the case.</p>
<p>Older computer software often aimed to replicate physical objects and
experiences.  This approach (skeuomorphism) was about making digital
interfaces feel familiar to older physical objects.  They resembled the
appearance and behavior even though they didn't need to.  Ironically
though skeuomorphism despite focusing on look and feel, rarely considers
some of the hidden affordances of the physical world.  Critically, rarely
does digial software feature degradation.  Yes, the trash bin was created
as an appoximation of this, but the bin seemingly did not make it farther
than file or email management software.  It also does not go far enough.</p>
<p>In the physical world, much of what we create has a natural tendency to
decay and that is really useful information.  A sticky note on a monitor
gathers dust and fades.  A notebook fills with notes and random scribbles,
becomes worn, and eventually ends up in a cabinet to finally end its
life discarded in a bin.  We probably all clear out our desk every couple
of months, tossing outdated items to keep the space manageable.  When I do
that, a key part of this is quickly judging how “old” some paper looks.
But even without regular cleaning, things are naturally lost or discarded
over time on my desk.  Yet software rarely behaves this way.  I think
that’s a problem.</p>
<p>When data is kept indefinitely by default, it changes our relationship
with that software.  People sometimes may hesitate to create anything in
shared spaces for fear of cluttering them, while others might
indiscriminately litter them.  In file-based systems, this may be
manageable, but in shared SaaS applications, everything created
(dashboards, notebooks, diagrams) lingers indefinitely and remains
searchable and discoverable.  This persistence seems advantageous but can
quickly lead to more and more clutter.</p>
<p>Adding new data to software is easy.  Scheduling it for automatic deletion
is a bit harder.  Simulating any kind of “visual decay” to hint at age or
relevance is rarely seen in today's software though it wouldn't be all
that hard to add.  I'm not convinced that the work required to implement
any of those things is why it does not exist, I think it's more likely
that there is a belief that keeping stuff around forever is a benefit over
the limitations of the real world.</p>
<p>The reality is that even though the entities we create are sticking around
forever, the information contained within them ages badly.  Of the 30 odd
&quot;test&quot; dashboards that are in our Datadog installation, most of them don't
show data any more.  The same is true for hundreds of notebooks.  We have
a few thousand notebooks and quite a few of them at this point are
anchored to data that is past the retention period or are referencing
metrics that are gone.</p>
<p>In shared spaces with lots of users, few things are intended to last
forever.  I hope that it will become more popular for software to take age
more intentional into account.  For instance one can start fading out old
documents that are rarely maintained or refreshed.  I want software to hide
old documents, dashboards etc. and that includes most critically not
showing up in search.  I don't want to accidentally navigate to old and
unused dashboards in the mids of an incident.</p>
<p>Sorting by frequency of use is insufficient to me.  Ideally software
embraced an “ephemeral by default” approach.  While there’s some risk of
data loss, you can make the deletion purely virtual (at least for a
while).  Imagine dashboard software with built-in “garbage collection”:
everything created starts with a short time-to-live (say, 30 days), after
which it moves to a “to sort” folder.  If it’s not actively sorted and
saved within six months, it's moved to a trash and eventually deleted.</p>
<p>This idea extends far beyond dashboards!  Wiki and innformation management
software like Notion could benefit from decaying notes, as the information
they hold often becomes outdated quickly.  I routinely encounter more
outdated pages than current ones.  While outright deletion may not be the
solution, irrelevant notes and documents showing up in searches add to the
clutter and make finding useful information harder.  “But I need my data
sometimes years later” I hear you say.  What about making it intentional?
Archive them in year books.  Make me intentionally “dig into the archives”
if I really have to.  There are many very intentional ways of dealing with
this problem.</p>
<p>And even if software does not want to go down that path I would at least
wish for scheduled deletion.  I will forget to delete, and I'm lazy and
given the tools available I rarely clean up.  Yet many of the things I
create I already know I really only need for a week or to.  So give me a
button I can press to schedule deletion.  Then I don't have to remember to
clean up after myself a few months later, but I can make that call already
today when I create my thing.</p>

            I was on a french speaking IRC chan bragging a tad about how I was doing a guitar tuner and paying attention to not fall into the pit of confusing precise and exact figures as a random computer engineer.<br /><br />
Science he was a patented CS engineer he wanted to prove me that my new guitar tuner was useless since <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/671f601f-0054-8008-b846-2fe368e63315"> AI could come with a better less convoluted exact example in less lines of code than mine</a> (mine is adapted from a <a href="https://makersportal.com/blog/2018/9/13/audio-processing-in-python-part-i-sampling-and-the-fast-fourier-transform">blog on audio processing and fast fourier transform because it was commented and was refreshing me the basics of signal processing</a>).
  
<br /><br />And I asked him, have you ever heard of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist_frequency">the Nyquist frequency </a>? or the tradeoff an oscilloscope have to do between time locality and accuracy ?<br /><br />
Of course he didn't. And was proud that a wannabee coder would be proven useless thanks to the dumbest AI. <br /><br />
<br /><br />
So I actually made this guitar tuner because this time I wanted to have an exact figure around the Hertz. <br />
The problem stated by FFT/Nyquist formula is that if I want an exact number around 1Hz (1 period per second) I should sample at least half a period (hence .5 second), and should not expect a good resolution.<br /><br />
The quoted chatgpt code takes 1024 samples out of 44100/sec, giving it a nice reactivity of 1/44th of a second with an accuracy of 44100/1024/2 => 21Hz.<br /><br />
I know chatgpt does not tune a guitar, but shouldn't the chatgpt user bragging about the superiority of pro as him remember that when we tune we may tune not only at A = 440Hz but maybe A = 432Hz or other ? <br /><br />
A note is defined as a racine 12th of 2 compared to an arbitrary reference (remember an octave is doubling => 12 half tones = 2) ; what makes a temperate scale is not the reference but the relationship between notes and this enable bands of instrument to tune themselves according to the most unreliable but also nice instrument which is the human voice.<br /><br />
Giving the user 3 decimal after the comma is called being precise : it makes you look like a genius in the eye of the crowd. Giving the user 0 decimal but accurate frequency is what makes you look dumb in the eyes of the computer science engineer, but it way more useful in real life.<br /><br />
Here I took the liberty with <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pysine">pysine</a> to generate A on 6 octaves (ref A=440)  and use the recommanded chatgpt buffer size acknowledged by a pro CS engineer for tuning your guitar and my default choices. 
<pre>
for i in 55.0 110.0 220.0 440.0 880.0 1760.0 ; do python -m pysine $i 3; done

Here is the result with a chunk size of 1024 :

I may not be a computer engineer, I am dumb, but checking with easy to use tools that your final result is in sync with your goal is for me more important than diplomas and professional formations.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The code is yet another basic animation in matplotlib with a nice arrow pointing the frequency best fitting item. It is not the best algorithm, but it does the job.<br /><br />
Showing the harmonics as well as the tonal has another benefit it answers the questions : why would I tune my string on the note of the upper string ?<br />
Like tuning E on A ?<br /><br />
Well because -<i>at least for my half broken guitar</i>- it ensures to me that I will tune on the tonal note.<br /><br />
Here is a sample of tuning E on the empty string : 
<div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiiWmJducNEAOrUN3olmF7NjIzaufxDIxOtK1CNxPO3URsY1OY796p6a106xtHgxSbLCRx9Qu3vpv-UT9HVHBdMaYA8mIW9KXj8iI-xHBj0Sb_64XG4_CPw69JaeRkGr074YN-KOUwhoAfvCsaLWxerQPbDL9p4by67ZnX3MimPrQcW5kUluvmCu1ThHbo/s1600/mi.gif" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center;"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiiWmJducNEAOrUN3olmF7NjIzaufxDIxOtK1CNxPO3URsY1OY796p6a106xtHgxSbLCRx9Qu3vpv-UT9HVHBdMaYA8mIW9KXj8iI-xHBj0Sb_64XG4_CPw69JaeRkGr074YN-KOUwhoAfvCsaLWxerQPbDL9p4by67ZnX3MimPrQcW5kUluvmCu1ThHbo/s1600/mi.gif" /></a></div>

            Let's say you want to create a web app and you know Python really well. Your first thought might be Flask or Django or even FastAPI? All good choices but there is a lot to get a full web app into production. The framework we'll talk about today, Reflex, allows you to just write Python code and it turns it into a full web app running FastAPI, NextJS, React and more plus it handles the deployment for you. It's a cool idea. Let's talk to Elvis Kahoro and Nikhil Rao from Reflex.dev.

    <p>I am Abigail(Afi), a DSF member who has contributed to the Django Ecosystem for about four years. I have held the following positions in the community:</p>
    
    <ul>
    <li>Leadership council member for Black Python Devs (current)</li>
    <li>Open Source Program Manager for Black Python Devs - I am managing 39 of our community members make their first steps in open source (current)</li>
    <li>Programs Team member for DjangoCon US 2024</li>
    <li>Contributed in organizing Django Girls Zanzibar (2023) ahead of the first DjangoCon Africa, co-organiser of Django Girls in Kwahu-Ghana (2019), and coach at Django Girls Ho-Ghana; 2018, 2024 and Zanzibar (2023)</li>
    <li>DjangoCon US Speaker 2023, you can watch my talk here: <a href="https://youtu.be/YrlSlOZOkNQ?si=1kyvMAy4PUgZMxhw" rel="ugc">Strategies for Handling Conflicts and Rollbacks with Django</a></li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>I have extensive experiences with the community, which have contributed to my growth, and I believe serving on the board is a good way to give back. As such, I am positive that I would bring a refreshing perspective to the board and be a good match for community integration with Django.</p>
    
    <p>As a board member, I plan to increase interactions between the DSF and its user base by providing an official mailing list highlighting non-technical and technical updates that will keep Django users up-to-date with current developments and build a relationship with our user base. Through this, I aim to gather djangonauts from everywhere to support creating the next leaders of the Django community.</p>
    
    <p>In addition, I would like to use my experience in fostering Strategic Partnerships and Fundraising in the nonprofit space to help the DSF Fundraising WG find more sponsors for the DSF. While working with a community, I fostered vital partnerships with about 10 organisations, which contributed to reaching our Fundraising and Partnerships goal despite most organisations slashing nonprofit donations.</p>
    
    <p>As such, I believe those skills, coupled with my community experience, will contribute to the growth of the Django Community, especially when we attract sponsors and increase their efforts and visibility on our social media.</p></blockquote></details></section>
    <section><h2 id="alex-gomez"><strong>Alex Gómez</strong> <i>Barcelona, Spain</i> <a class="plink" href="#alex-gomez">¶</a></h2><details>View personal statement<blockquote><p>I began developing with Django at version 1.11 and have been an avid user since. I am a member of <a href="https://djangonaut.space" rel="ugc">Djangonaut Space</a> and was previously a Djangonaut in the program. I’m also an active member of Python Spain and Python Barcelona and have coached at multiple DjangoGirls workshops.</p>
    
    <p>I believe the next few years will be crucial for Django's future. It’s important for us to remain relevant and ensure that Django continues to be a choice for new projects, not just for maintaining existing ones.</p>
    
    <p>The DSF needs an executive director, we’ve reached the limit of what a volunteer board can do or be asked to do. This is my first and main priority for 2025 and I believe without such a change we will struggle to meaningfully advance.</p>
    
    <p>An obstacle to enacting an executive director is the need to expand the foundation's funding and pool of sponsors, and I propose that one of our most effective ways to achieve this is by expanding our communications. Too little of the Django user base is reached by the DSF and other non-official Django communications, leaving a wide userbase who may be very willing to support the project but do not know they can.</p>
    
    <p>In support of these goals, I will also make the website a priority. We’re years into attempting to revamp it, the last successful attempt being a decade ago. The website working group is not yet finalized, an executive director will help us push this forward.</p>
    
    <p>The DSF needs fresh perspectives, and with your support I believe I will bring positive changes to the Django community.</p></blockquote></details></section>

    <p>As a young Black African woman in STEM from the francophone region of Africa and an active DSF member, I’ve dedicated my career to fostering inclusivity and representation in the tech community and I am confident that I bring a unique perspective to the table. My extensive experience organizing major events like:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>DjangoCon US 2024, </li>
    <li>DjangoCon Africa 2023, and </li>
    <li>PyCon Africa 2020 (as a volunteer) | 2024 (as an IOC member ) has equipped me with the skills and insights needed to drive inclusivity and community engagement.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>My journey has been fueled by a passion for diversity and representation. I have seen firsthand the incredible impact that inclusive environments can have on underrepresented communities, especially in Africa, and I am dedicated to amplifying these voices within the Django ecosystem. As a mentor in the both the Python and the Django Community, as well as a mentor and community manager at BEL'S AI Initiative in Cameroon, I have empowered many young technologists, fostering a supportive and inclusive community.</p>
    
    <p>I aim to bridge the gap between the DSF Board and our vibrant African community, ensuring that our unique perspectives and needs are heard and addressed. I am committed to being the voice of Africa within the board and representing the board within my community. By voting for me, you are supporting a vision of inclusivity, innovation, and growth for the Django community.</p>
    <p>To achieve this, I plan to:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Launch official DSF multilingual mentoring programs, targeted at underrepresented groups from Africa, with plans to expand globally.</li>
    <li>Introduce the Django Diversity Incubator, offering resources, workshops, scholarships, and global hackathons to underrepresented groups around the world.</li>
    <li>Create a Django Open Source Fellows interns role, to welcome new people into code and non-code contributions.</li>

    <section><h2 id="bhuvnesh-sharma"><strong>Bhuvnesh Sharma</strong> <i>India</i> <a class="plink" href="#bhuvnesh-sharma">¶</a></h2><details>View personal statement<blockquote><p>Hi everyone!  I'm excited to throw my hat in the ring for the DSF Board of Directors.</p>
    
    <p>To me, there appears to be a critical component that could benefit from increased attention: social media and marketing. And I believe It's time we start giving Django the social media attention it deserves.</p>
    <p>Let's be real: If we master this social media game, Django's reach will explode, and the entire ecosystem will thrive.</p>
    <p>The more we boost Django’s presence online, the more up-and-coming developers will flock to it. And with that surge in usage comes the rise of Django-focused communities—stronger, more engaged, and constantly growing.</p>
    
    <p>Now, here’s where it gets exciting: more visibility leads to a snowball effect.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Visibility drives growth: More eyes on Django → more users → more contributors</li>
    <li>Quality fuels adoption: More contributors → better Django → increased commercial usage</li>
    <li>Success attracts support: Increased usage → more sponsors → resources for further expansion</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Then guess what? We loop back to the start: Django gets bigger, stronger, and better.</p>
    
    <p>Here are few-of-many pointers that I am aiming to start with during my tenure as a board member:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Boost Django's presence in Asia through targeted outreach and events.</li>
    <li>Launch Django Ambassadors program to recognize influential community members.</li>
    <li>Facilitate non-coding contributions to Django (design, content, event organizing).</li>
    <li>Create a volunteer layer between the DSF and interested individuals who are eager to contribute to specific working groups (WGs).</li>
    <li>Produce engaging social media content similar to Feature Fridays.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>I am highly motivated to lead Django’s social media and marketing as a Board member. I have more high-level plans and ideas in mind, and I’m focused on finding the right time and people for their execution. Additionally, I would represent the Asia region and bring valuable diversity in the DSF board. You can read more about my plans in the blog here: <a href="https://devilsautumn.hashnode.dev/making-django-unstoppable-my-plan-to-boost-visibility-and-drive-growth" rel="ugc">Making Django Unstoppable: My Plan to Boost Visibility and Drive Growth</a></p>
    
    <p>Now talking about myself, I am a django core contributor and have been involved with DSF for around past 1.5 years as a DSF member. I also did Google Summer of Code with Django in 2023 and mentored in Google Summer of Code 2024 with Django. Apart from code contributions I have contributed to Django in various others ways:</p>
    
    <ul>

From the outset, participating in developer meetups and events, particularly DjangoCon Africa, has not only strengthened my technical skills but also reshaped my understanding of growth—both personal and professional. </p>
    
    <p>Driven by a desire to make a meaningful difference, I am pursuing a position on the Django Software Foundation Board. I bring a commitment to promoting diversity, inclusivity, and accessibility within the Django ecosystem. As a vocal advocate for African and minority communities, I believe my presence on the Board would add a valuable perspective to the DSF’s mission, ensuring that emerging developers from underrepresented backgrounds find opportunities, resources, and community support in Django.</p>
    
    <p>My experience with the Swahilipot Hub Foundation, a Kenyan NGO supporting youth along the coast, has equipped me with essential skills in community engagement and in applying technology for social good. Through this role, I have developed Django-based solutions that empower community self-management—an experience that has reinforced my belief in Django’s potential to uplift communities around the globe. On the DSF Board, I aim to serve not only as a representative for these communities but also as a mentor and technical guide.</p></blockquote></details></section>

    <p>My background is as a Django user and educator. I’ve built several successful products on Django, spoken at multiple DjangoCons and PyCons and have published many popular articles and videos about using Django. I currently run a Django boilerplate product that helps people build apps and start businesses on top of Django. I’m also a member of the DSF and the social media working group.</p>
    
    <p>My platform is relatively simple. I don’t want Django to get left behind. I’ve seen old frameworks like Rails and Laravel continually reinvent themselves, bringing new cohorts of web developers into the fold, while Django has largely stayed the same.</p>
    
    <p>Part of the issue is Django’s reluctance to adopt modern technologies— with better front end being at the top of my list. But I don’t have unrealistic aspirations of adding HTMX, Tailwind, or React to Django, so much as starting the conversation about how the Django ecosystem can have a better story for people who want to use those things.</p>
    
    <p>The other part—and the part I hope to help with more—is cultural. Specifically, getting Django to do a better job at selling itself. This means working harder to pitch and position Django as a great, modern framework for building apps. As well as creating more opportunities and incentives for funding Django.</p>
    
    <p>If elected, I’ll try to be a voice on the board that pushes Django forwards, while understanding that I will often get pushed back. Let’s keep Django great for another 20 years!</p></blockquote></details></section>

Over the years, I have not only built my career around Django and Python, but I have also actively contributed to expanding the Django community. My journey has led me to found a consultancy firm focused on these technologies, and I’ve dedicated my efforts to bringing new developers into the community and fostering its growth.</p>
    
    <p>In 2019, during DjangoCon Europe in Copenhagen, I strongly desired to take my community involvement to the next level. I proposed to organize DjangoCon Europe 2020 in Portugal. Though the pandemic reshaped those plans, I co-organized the first virtual-only DjangoCon Europe in 2020, another virtual edition in 2021, and the first hybrid event in 2022. Our 2022 edition set a new record, with over 500 in-person attendees and 200+ online participants. The experience has been gratifying, and I continue to be actively involved in the community by co-organizing DjangoCon Europe 2024 in Vigo, Spain, and preparing for DjangoCon Europe 2025 in Dublin, Ireland.</p>
    
    <p>In addition to my work with Django, I am deeply committed to the growth of the Python community in Portugal. In 2022, I co-founded PyCon Portugal, intending to host the conference in a different city each year to maximize its reach and impact. The first edition in Porto succeeded, followed by Coimbra in 2023, which attracted participants from over 25 countries. By the time of this election, PyCon Portugal 2024 in Braga will have concluded, furthering our goal of uniting and strengthening the Portuguese Python community.</p>
    
    <p>I am enthusiastic, committed, and pragmatic. In every initiative I’ve taken, I strive to make a positive and meaningful impact, influencing and empowering those around me. My experience organizing large-scale events, building communities, and fostering collaboration can be valuable to the Django Software Foundation.</p>
    
    <p>I look forward to contributing my skills and dedication to help guide the DSF’s efforts in the years ahead.</p></blockquote></details></section>

    <p>The key to making the DSF more sustainable is the stability that hiring an Executive Director brings. From day-to-day communications to supporting the Django Fellows to improving our ability to fundraise, everything revolves around having someone whose job is to run and support the foundation. I believe an ED will help Django get a seat to more conversations involving open source and web standards that we get passed over today. </p>
    
    <p>I bring over two decades of non-profit experience, including co-founding DEFNA (the other Django non-profit) and serving on the Python Software Foundation, including leadership roles (Treasurer and Vice Chair). I have also helped organize DjangoCon US for over a decade, and we have seen many community members and leaders grow through that community-building experience. I'm an advisor for Black Python Devs and have been a mentor through the Djangonaut Space project. </p>
    
    <p>I want to revise and revisit our sponsorship plans and fundraising goals. They have not changed much over the years despite companies' needs changing significantly. We did this with the PSF, and it increased the number of developers in resident roles (the PSF's version of Fellows) we could fund. It's time for the DSF to revise our plans. </p>
    
    <p>I want to revise our approach to DjangoCons and other "why aren't they called DjangoCon" community events. Why aren't more of these promoted or listed through the Django website? </p>
    
    <p>I firmly believe in the Campsite Rule: "Always leave the campground cleaner than you found it."

    <p>Before assisting to DjangoCon US, I saw Django as just part of the larger Python community. But seeing how this community goes above and beyond to support both longtime members and newcomers changed that for me. When others suggested I run for the board, it felt like a way I could give back and share what makes Django special on a global scale.</p>
    
    <h3>A Bit About Me</h3>
    <p>I co-founded and organized the Python Paraguay community, starting with our first PyDay in 2015, which was a huge success and sparked a lasting momentum. Since then, I’ve organized meetups, events, workshops, and grown our community to almost two thousand members—the most active tech group in Paraguay! I also used Django for projects that make a difference: <a href="https://ayudapy.org/" rel="ugc">AyudaPy.org</a>, a mutual aid platform during COVID-19 (which I presented at DjangoCon US 2022), and <a href="https://listahu.org/" rel="ugc">Lista Hũ</a>, a tool to protect against scammers, both of which highlight Django’s potential for social good.</p>
    
    <h3>Ideas for Django</h3>
    
    <ul>
    <li>Learning Curve: Improving the Django tutorial and expanding learning resources can make Django more accessible and less intimidating for newcomers. Creating more comprehensive, step-by-step guides will empower new developers and ease their journey into Django.</li>
    <li>Supporting Global Accessibility: Expanding Django’s reach by focusing on language accessibility and gathering regional feedback is key. Adding questions to the Django Developers Survey on preferred languages and translation quality could help the community prioritize localization efforts, ensuring developers worldwide feel supported in their native languages.</li>

    <p>I think that the Django Software Foundation has the potential to facilitate and promote these initiatives. It also has the authority to relate to other Open Source communities, to seek synergies, and with big corporations, to grow from an economic point of view, being able to pay more people (e.g., Django Fellows, Directors, UI/UX experts, …)</p>

    <p>If you are one of the regulars on the official Django Discord server, my passion and dedication to both the Django community and framework should be no secret. As a helper, I have helped countless other developers use Django successfully. As a moderator, I do my best to ensure that we have a community that we can all be proud to consider our own, regardless of our background. An environment that is inclusive, diverse, and welcoming. To me, it feels like home, and I hope you all feel the same way.</p>
    
    <p>For those I haven't yet had the pleasure to meet on Discord or elsewhere, I hope we do soon.</p>
    
    <p>About me:</p>
    
    <ul>
    <li>I have been building on the web since the Geocities days, and have over 17 years of professional experience, meaning I know how to get things done.</li>
    <li>I have experience building and managing communities, including forums and subreddits, meaning I can readily help with the technical and human aspects.</li>
    <li>I am proactive, and lucky enough to have a lot of flexibility in how I spend my time, meaning I can help turn decisions into action.</li>
    <li>I am open-minded, and eager to learn, meaning I am looking forward to working for the community, with the board, rather than wanting to impose my own ideas.</li>
    <li>I am a polyglot speaking more than four languages fluently, meaning I feel connections to others, regardless of geographical borders.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>If elected, my goals will be:</p>
    
    <ul>
    <li>Collaborating with the other board members. Django's popularity and stability is a testament to the fantastic work current and past board members and developers have done, and while I may have my own ideas, I would first want to know more about any backlog, plans, or other issues that need to be resolved rather than bring about drastic changes.</li>
    <li>Efficiently implementing board decisions. While plans may sometimes forcibly change, they at least need someone to take charge of them. I am happy to lend my technical expertise when required, and deal with other roadblocks.</li>
    <li>Community representation. As a fairly visible member of the Django community, I am looking forward to ensuring the community feels represented and heard, and seeing what more we can do to help the community grow.</li>
    <li>Increase representation of non-English speakers. While English is the de facto business language, there are other large markets that would benefit from better support.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>As Django nears twenty years of existence, becoming a board member certainly gives us some big shoes to fill, but between my passion, this amazing community's support, and the time I can dedicate to the position, I am confident that I can help the community continue to thrive, make a tangible difference, and better serve the community we all know and love.</p>

For those that don't know me, I've also been actively contributing features for most of the last decade. I help run the Discord, the accessibility team, and I'm on the fundraising working group. If that sounds like a lot of time commitment already, you're right. If you vote for me I might have to become dormant in some other roles.</p>
    
    <p>But I don't really want to talk about my perspective as a contributor, I want to talk about my experience as a user. I've been using Django since around 2008. We have great batteries for 2008. For 2024? I am not so sure. I feel like we are missing things like:</p>
    
    <ul>
    <li>Built in 2FA with WebAuthn / passkeys.</li>
    <li>Better serialization to make APIs without needing a second framework.</li>
    <li>A better frontend story, whether that's tutorials on integrating frameworks or how to use simpler solutions like HTMX, template components (or all of the above).</li>
    <li>A more modern, accessible admin interface with better UX.</li>
    <li>Simpler project setup for small projects, including deployment and static files (integrating white noise?).</li>
    <li>(type hints maybe?)</li>
    <li>I could increase the size of this Wishlist by several factors and still not be done.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The reason I believe we're missing these things is simple (and possibly wrong). Django is getting bigger, more mature, and prioritises stability. These are all great things, but they do slow down development when almost all new features are contributed by people volunteering their time.</p>
    
    <p>To fix this, Django needs money, which is why I joined the fundraising group, and then there is the question of spending that money. And for the me the priorities are clear:</p>
    
    <ol>
    <li>Spend money to make more money.</li>
    <li>Hire more fellows and widen their remit to contributing new features.</li>
    </ol>

            <p>I talked about the new Python 3.13 REPL <a href="https://treyhunner.com/2024/05/my-favorite-python-3-dot-13-feature/">a few months ago</a> and <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/python-313-whats-new/">after 3.13 was released</a>.
I think it&rsquo;s <strong>awesome</strong>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to share a secret feature within the Python 3.13 REPL which I&rsquo;ve been finding useful recently: <strong>adding custom keyboard shortcuts</strong>.</p>

<p>This feature involves a <code>PYTHONSTARTUP</code> file, use of an unsupported Python module, and dynamically evaluating code.</p>

<p>In short, we may be getting ourselves into trouble.
But the result is <em>very</em> neat!</p>

<p>Thanks to Łukasz Llanga for inspiring this post via his excellent <a href="https://youtu.be/dK6HGcSb60Y?si=jWPEa8BcdYGnW9l6">EuroPython keynote talk</a>.</p>

<h2>The goal: keyboard shortcuts in the REPL</h2>

<p>First, I&rsquo;d like to explain the end result.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say I&rsquo;m in the Python REPL on my machine and I&rsquo;ve typed <code>numbers =</code>:</p>

<figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="pycon"><span class="line"><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">numbers</span> <span class="o">=</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I can now hit <code>Ctrl-N</code> to enter a list of numbers I often use while teaching (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas_number">Lucas numbers</a>):</p>

<figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="pycon"><span class="line"><span class="go">numbers = [2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, 29]</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>That saved me some typing!</p>

<h2>Getting a prototype working</h2>

<p>First, let&rsquo;s try out an example command.</p>

<p>Copy-paste this into your Python 3.13 REPL:</p>

<figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now hit <code>Ctrl-N</code>.</p>

<p>If all worked as planned, you should see that list of numbers entered into the REPL.</p>

<p>Cool!
Now let&rsquo;s generalize this trick and make Python run our code whenever it starts.</p>

<p>But first&hellip; a disclaimer.</p>

<h2>Here be dragons 🐉</h2>

<p>Notice that <code>_</code> prefix in the <code>_pyrepl</code> module that we&rsquo;re importing from?
That means this module is officially unsupported.</p>

<p>The <code>_pyrepl</code> module is an implementation detail and its implementation may change at any time in future Python versions.</p>

<p>In other words: <code>_pyrepl</code> is designed to be used by <em>Python&rsquo;s standard library modules</em> and not anyone else.
That means that we should assume this code will break in a future Python version.</p>

<p>Will that stop us from playing with this module for the fun of it?</p>

<p>It won&rsquo;t.</p>

<h2>Creating a <code>PYTHONSTARTUP</code> file</h2>

<p>So we&rsquo;ve made <em>one</em> custom key combination for ourselves.
How can we setup this command automatically whenever the Python REPL starts?</p>

<p>We need a <code>PYTHONSTARTUP</code> file.</p>

<p>When Python launches, if it sees a <code>PYTHONSTARTUP</code> environment variable it will treat that environment variable as a Python file to run on startup.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve made a <code>/home/trey/.python_startup.py</code> file and I&rsquo;ve set this environment variable in my shell&rsquo;s configuration file (<code>~/.zshrc</code>):</p>

<figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="bash"><span class="line"><span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">PYTHONSTARTUP</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nv">$HOME</span>/.python_startup.py
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>To start, we could put our single custom command in this file:</p>

<figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Note that I&rsquo;ve stuck our code in a <code>try</code>-<code>except</code> block.
Our code <em>only</em> runs if those <code>_pyrepl</code> imports succeed.</p>

<p>Note that this <em>might</em> still raise an exception when Python starts <em>if</em> the reader object&rsquo;s <code>command</code> attribute or <code>bind</code> method change in a way that breaks our code.</p>

<p>Personally, I&rsquo;d like to see those breaking changes occur print out a traceback the next time I upgrade Python.
So I&rsquo;m going to leave those last few lines <em>without</em> their own catch-all exception handler.</p>

<h2>Generalizing the code</h2>

<p>This version uses a dictionary to map keyboard shortcuts to the text they should insert.</p>

<p>Note that we&rsquo;re repeatedly building up a string of <code>Command</code> subclasses for each shortcut, using <code>exec</code> to execute the code for that custom <code>Command</code> subclass, and then binding the keyboard shortcut to that new command class.</p>

<p>At the end we then delete all the variables we&rsquo;ve made so our REPL will start the clean global environment we normally expect it to have:</p>

<figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Is this messy?</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>Is that a needless use of a dictionary that could have been a list of 2-item tuples instead?</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>Does this work?</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<h2>Doing more interesting and risky stuff</h2>

<p>Note that there are many keyboard shortcuts that may cause weird behaviors if you bind them.</p>

<p>For example, if you bind <code>Ctrl-i</code>, your binding may trigger every time you try to indent.
And if you try to bind <code>Ctrl-m</code>, your binding may be ignored because this is equivalent to hitting the <code>Enter</code> key.</p>

<p>So be sure to test your REPL carefully after each new binding you try to invent.</p>

<p>If you want to do something more interesting, you could poke around in the <code>_pyrepl</code> package to see what existing code you can use/abuse.</p>

<p>For example, here&rsquo;s a very hacky way of making a binding to <code>Ctrl-x</code> followed by <code>Ctrl-r</code> to make this import <code>subprocess</code>, type in a <code>subprocess.run</code> line, and move your cursor between the empty string within the <code>run</code> call:</p>

<h2>What keyboard shortcuts are available?</h2>

<p>As you play with customizing keyboard shortcuts, you&rsquo;ll likely notice that many key combinations result in strange and undesirable behavior when overridden.</p>

<p>For example, overriding <code>Ctrl-J</code> will also override the <code>Enter</code> key&hellip; at least it does in my terminal.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll list the key combinations that seem unproblematic on my setup with Gnome Terminal in Ubuntu Linux.</p>

<p>Here are <code>Control</code> key shortcuts that seem to be complete unused in the Python REPL:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Ctrl-N</code></li>
<li><code>Ctrl-O</code></li>
<li><code>Ctrl-P</code></li>
<li><code>Ctrl-Q</code></li>
<li><code>Ctrl-S</code></li>
<li><code>Ctrl-V</code></li>
</ul>


<p>Note that overriding <code>Ctrl-H</code> is often an alternative to the backspace key</p>

<p>Here are <code>Alt</code>/<code>Meta</code> key shortcuts that appear unused on my machine:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Alt-A</code></li>
<li><code>Alt-E</code></li>
<li><code>Alt-G</code></li>
<li><code>Alt-H</code></li>
<li><code>Alt-I</code></li>
<li><code>Alt-J</code></li>
<li><code>Alt-K</code></li>
<li><code>Alt-M</code></li>
<li><code>Alt-N</code></li>
<li><code>Alt-O</code></li>
<li><code>Alt-P</code></li>
<li><code>Alt-Q</code></li>
<li><code>Alt-S</code></li>
<li><code>Alt-V</code></li>
<li><code>Alt-W</code></li>
<li><code>Alt-X</code></li>
<li><code>Alt-Z</code></li>
</ul>


<p>You can add an <code>Alt</code> shortcut by using <code>\M</code> (for &ldquo;meta&rdquo;).
So <code>r"\M-a"</code> would capture <code>Alt-A</code> just as <code>r"\C-a"</code> would capture <code>Ctrl-A</code>.</p>

<p>Here are keyboard shortcuts that <em>can</em> be customized but you might want to consider whether the current default behavior is worth losing:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Alt-B</code>: backward word (same as <code>Ctrl-Left</code>)</li>
<li><code>Alt-C</code>: capitalize word (does nothing on my machine&hellip;)</li>
<li><code>Alt-D</code>: kill word (delete to end of word)</li>
<li><code>Alt-F</code>: forward word (same as <code>Ctrl-Right</code>)</li>
<li><code>Alt-L</code>: downcase word (does nothing on my machine&hellip;)</li>
<li><code>Alt-U</code>: upcase word (does nothing on my machine&hellip;)</li>
<li><code>Alt-Y</code>: yank pop</li>
<li><code>Ctrl-A</code>: beginning of line (like the <code>Home</code> key)</li>
<li><code>Ctrl-B</code>: left (like the <code>Left</code> key)</li>
<li><code>Ctrl-E</code>: end of line (like the <code>End</code> key)</li>
<li><code>Ctrl-F</code>: right (like the <code>Right</code> key)</li>
<li><code>Ctrl-G</code>: cancel</li>
<li><code>Ctrl-H</code>: backspace (same as the <code>Backspace</code> key)</li>
<li><code>Ctrl-K</code>: kill line (delete to end of line)</li>
<li><code>Ctrl-T</code>: transpose characters</li>
<li><code>Ctrl-U</code>: line discard (delete to beginning of line)</li>
<li><code>Ctrl-W</code>: word discard (delete to beginning of word)</li>
<li><code>Ctrl-Y</code>: yank</li>
<li><code>Alt-R</code>: restore history (within history mode)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>This instalment in a series of articles about API integrations with Salesforce
covers connected apps - how to create them
and how to obtain their credentials needed to exchange REST messages with Salesforce.</p>
<p>In Salesforce's terminology, a connected app is, essentially, an API client. It has credentials, a set of permissions,
and it works on behalf of a user in an automated manner.</p>
<p>In particular, the kind of a connected app that I am going to create below is one that can be used in backend, server-side
integrations that operate without any direct input from end users or administrators, i.e. the app is created once, its permissions
and credentials are set once, and then it is able to work uninterrupted in the background, on server side.</p>
<p>Server-side systems are quite unlike other kinds of apps, such as mobile ones, that assume there is a human operator involved -
they have their own work characteristics, related yet different, and I am not going to cover them here.</p>
<p>Note that permission types and their scopes are a separate, broad subject and they will described in a separate how-to article.</p>
<p>Finally, I assume that you are either an administrator in a Salesforce organization or that you are preparing information
for another person with similar grants in Salesforce.</p>
<p>Conceptually, there is nothing particularly unusual about Salesforce connected apps, it is just its own mini-world
of jargon and, at the end of the day, it simply enables you to invoke APIs that Salesforce is built on. It is just that knowing
where to click, what to choose and how to navigate the user interface can be a daunting challenge that this article hopes
to make easier to overcome.</p>
<h2 id="the-steps">The steps</h2>
<p>For an automated, server-side connected app to make use of Salesforce APIs, the requirements are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Having access to username/password credentials</li>
<li>Creating a connected app</li>
<li>Granting permissions to the app (not covered in this article)</li>
<li>Obtaining a customer key and customer secret for the app</li>
</ul>
<p>You will note that there are four credentials in total:</p>
<ul>
<li>Username</li>
<li>Password</li>
<li>Customer key</li>
<li>Customer secret</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, depending on what chapter of the Salesforce documentation you are reading, you will note that the customer key
can be also known as "client_id" whereas another name for the customer secret is "client_secret". These two pairs
mean the same.</p>
<h2 id="access-to-usernamepassword-credentials">Access to username/password credentials</h2>
<p>For starters, you need to have an account in Salesforce, a combination of username + password that you can log in with
and on whose behalf the connected app will be created:</p>
<p><img src="https://upcdn.io/kW15bqq/raw/root/static/blog/images/3.2-salesforce/app-login.png" /></p>
<h2 id="creating-a-connected-app">Creating a connected app</h2>
<p>Once you are logged in, go to Setup in the top right-hand corner:</p>
<p><img src="https://upcdn.io/kW15bqq/raw/root/static/blog/images/3.2-salesforce/app-setup.png" /></p>
<p>In the search box, look up "app manager":</p>
<p><img src="https://upcdn.io/kW15bqq/raw/root/static/blog/images/3.2-salesforce/app-search-manager.png" /></p>
<p>Next, click the "New Connected App" button to the right:</p>
<p><img src="https://upcdn.io/kW15bqq/raw/root/static/blog/images/3.2-salesforce/app-new-connected-button.png" /></p>
<p>Fill out the basic details such as "Connect App Name" and make sure that you select "Enable OAuth Settings". Then,
given that in this document we are not dealing with the subject of permissions at all, grant full access to the connected
app and finally click "Save" at the bottom of the page.</p>
<p><img src="https://upcdn.io/kW15bqq/raw/root/static/blog/images/3.2-salesforce/app-full-access.png" /></p>
<h2 id="obtaining-a-customer-key-and-customer-secret">Obtaining a customer key and customer secret</h2>
<p>We have a connected app but we still do not know what its customer key and secret are. To reveal it, go to the "App Manager"
once more, either via the search box or using the menu on the left hand side.</p>
<p><img src="https://upcdn.io/kW15bqq/raw/root/static/blog/images/3.2-salesforce/app-manager-menu.png" /></p>
<p>Find your app in the list and click "View" in the list of actions. Observe that it is "View", not "Edit" or "Manage", where
you can check what the credentials are:</p>
<p><img src="https://upcdn.io/kW15bqq/raw/root/static/blog/images/3.2-salesforce/app-view.png" /></p>
<p>The customer key and secret van be now revealed in the "API (Enable OAuth Settings)" section:</p>
<p><img src="https://upcdn.io/kW15bqq/raw/root/static/blog/images/3.2-salesforce/app-view-secrets.png" /></p>
<p>This concludes the process - you have a connected app and all the credentials needed now.</p>
<h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>
<p>Seeing as this document is part of a series of how-tos in the context of Zato, if you would like to integrate with Salesforce in
Python, at this point you will be able to follow the steps in
<a href="https://zato.io/en/blog/salesforce-python.html">another</a>
where everything is detailed separately.</p>
<p>Just as a quick teaser, it would look akin to the below.</p>

<p>On a much lower level, however, if you would just like to quickly test out whether you configured the connected app correctly,
you can invoke from command line a Salesforce REST endpoint that will return an OAuth token, as below.</p>
<p>Note that, as I mentioned it previously, client_id is the same as customer key and client_secret is the same as customer secret.</p>
