            <h3 style="text-align: left;"><b>TL;DR:</b></h3><p>Effective August 1st, 2025, the PSF is temporarily pausing our Grants Program after reaching our 2025 grant budget cap earlier than expected. We know how important this program is to many in our community and making this decision was difficult. This is a necessary step to protect both the future of the program and the short- and long-term sustainability of the PSF. (If this moves you immediately to donate to the PSF, we welcome your contributions via <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/donations/" target="_blank">our donations page</a>).</p><p></p><h3 style="text-align: left;">The PSF Grants Program is paused</h3><p>As <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/12/psf-grants-program-charter-updates-tldr.html" target="_blank">we shared in December 2024</a> (specifically, <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/12/12psf-grants-program-charter-updates-part-3.html" target="_blank">part 3</a>), the PSF implemented changes to the Grants Program in March 2025 in an effort to ensure the sustainability of the program and the foundation. PSF Staff have been checking in quarterly on our award expenditure, and at the end of Q1, we were on track. When PSF Staff reviewed approved grant awards at the end of Q2, however, we had granted close to 80% of the 2025 grant budget. The grant applications received so far through July exceed the budget ceiling.&nbsp;<br /><br />What does this mean? <b>The PSF Board has voted to implement a pause, effective August 1st, 2025, on the PSF Grants Program.</b> The PSF Board and Staff explored our options thoroughly before coming to this tough, and frankly painful, decision as we deeply understand how important the grants program is to the Python community.&nbsp;<br /><br />Everyone at the PSF is constantly amazed and impressed with the creativity, drive, and ingenuity of the Python community. Supporting the community’s success with our Grants Program is at the heart of our mission—and it brings so much joy to the PSF Board, our small but mighty team of staff, and the wonderful folks in our Work Groups. We are heartbroken to have to pause that work and we know this will be challenging and create more difficult decisions in turn for the many community groups that had planned to apply for the grants program.&nbsp;<br /><br />We will be distributing the small amount of remaining funds in the 2025 PSF Grants Program budget. To honor the time and energy spent on applications already submitted and in the spirit of equity, <b>any applications that were received before August 1st, 2025 will be granted a uniform percentage of the award amount for which they are eligible.</b> If you have a grant application in the system, you will receive an email from us soon with more information. Please send any urgent inquiries to grants@python.org.<br /><br />The PSF aims to be as transparent as possible, and we want to have two-way conversations with the community about this change. We are holding an additional <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/02/introducing-psf-grants-office-hours.html" target="_blank">PSF Grants Program Office Hour</a> in August on the <a href="https://discord.gg/7rthGF3BBe" target="_blank">PSF Discord</a>. We welcome folks to join both or either session:<br /></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>August 13th, 8-9 pm UTC</li><li>August 19th, 1-2 pm UTC</li></ul><p>We also welcome your feedback, particularly how we can support you during this pause, via email to grants@python.org or on the <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/the-psf-has-paused-our-grants-program/101288" target="_blank">thread we’ve started on discuss.python.org</a>.<br /></p><h3 style="text-align: left;">How we got here&nbsp;</h3><div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: left;">Since announcing Grants program changes in December 2024, grant requests
 have grown about 40% over last year. It’s wonderful to see long-time 
events continue to grow. It’s been equally inspiring to see events being
 revived as we move further from 2020 and the start of the COVID 
pandemic, alongside brand-new initiatives from new and seasoned 
organizers. The PSF <b>loves</b> seeing the growth, but the heart of the
 issue is that Python and its community continue to grow exponentially, 
while our funding has not kept pace, and in fact, has decreased.<br /><br />With Python being the <a href="https://github.blog/news-insights/octoverse/octoverse-2024/" target="_blank">number one language on GitHub</a> and <a href="https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/" target="_blank">rising steadily on the TIOBE index</a>,
 it’s no surprise that our community continues to build and grow as 
well. You can see the TIOBE 
index shows what the growth of Python looks like over the years, and how
 much it’s grown in just the past year:<br />&nbsp;</div><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEht7GZUmYfp6B2461-DVgvVlWa5wo2t7n-p5ZOhwU6JHpLM6Nvisw7UHelNjU2P408QYUPGT0amf_zxq9q6Z8b6n0DO7tK86RPkxUQbg7puBF1cWPV3cUMbLkQgESH27-IhezznZd3HAHx6twIQ8psDLoSNZZh0I9mcB0jriqZiadlo3QTaYQ/s2953/python_tiobe.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="244" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEht7GZUmYfp6B2461-DVgvVlWa5wo2t7n-p5ZOhwU6JHpLM6Nvisw7UHelNjU2P408QYUPGT0amf_zxq9q6Z8b6n0DO7tK86RPkxUQbg7puBF1cWPV3cUMbLkQgESH27-IhezznZd3HAHx6twIQ8psDLoSNZZh0I9mcB0jriqZiadlo3QTaYQ/w400-h244/python_tiobe.png" width="400" /></a></div><p>By contrast, the PSF’s available resources have decreased over the last three years and are projected to decrease again in 2025 due to increasing PyCon US and foundation costs. Much of the growth shown before 2022 in the chart below comes from grants we received that were restricted funds dedicated to specific staffing and other programs. The result is increasing global community activity against a decreasing pool of available funds.&nbsp;</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiiH_a89NPF5ydqQMcvx1HaZmdKCIeGc-OX4wf23Fwirp9wqD5QSxY414NJUJW3mH9UUP6CzgkU65mrVOhDHamy5aZXJp8_b1QW0m5OkHNVknnJAQ1OXnWA0i7soEK36os6920emjp5xPGcSHlTIxKSYC09fl_LDjxXQWC8-_yzQ7vH41Gw3w/s782/psf_asset_trends.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="640" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiiH_a89NPF5ydqQMcvx1HaZmdKCIeGc-OX4wf23Fwirp9wqD5QSxY414NJUJW3mH9UUP6CzgkU65mrVOhDHamy5aZXJp8_b1QW0m5OkHNVknnJAQ1OXnWA0i7soEK36os6920emjp5xPGcSHlTIxKSYC09fl_LDjxXQWC8-_yzQ7vH41Gw3w/w464-h640/psf_asset_trends.png" width="464" /></a></div><p></p>For example, 2023 year-end assets were $5.5M with total grants awarded 
at $677K. The following year, 2024 assets decreased slightly to $4.3M, 
but grants awarded jumped to $952K. You can see in the graph above how 
that negatively impacted our assets, a trend that is not sustainable 
even in the short term.

 <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/12/12psf-grants-program-charter-updates-part-3.html" target="_blank">PSF Grants Program adjustments implemented earlier this year</a> aimed to 
reduce total grant award spending while providing a more equitable 
approach, but the growth in new/revived grant applications outpaced the 
lowered caps and other limits. As we reviewed Q2 spending, it became 
clear that the unexpected influx of qualified grant proposals had 
already almost exhausted the total amount we had budgeted for the full 
year.&nbsp;<br /><br /></p><p></p><h3 style="text-align: left;">We’re in this together</h3><p>The
 PSF is in a similar position to the many other organizations and NGOs 
(and all of our volunteer conference and meetup organizers!) trying to 
support the Python community and foundation while faced with inflation, 
lower sponsorship, economic pressure in the tech sector, and 
global/local uncertainty and conflict.&nbsp;<br /><br />Last year, <a href="https://pycon.blogspot.com/2024/11/important-changes-ahead-commitment-to.html" target="_blank">the PyCon US blog explained</a> that PyCon US 2024 generated a significant loss; losses 
from PyCon US are paid for by PSF general funds that are also the 
financial source for the PSF Grants programs. For many years, PyCon US 
created a surplus used to fund Grants, PSF staff, and other programs. 
Based on the current numbers for PyCon US 2025, the PSF will need to 
fund another loss. Many factors including the lower-than-budgeted 
attendance, higher location costs, and the current economic and 
political situation contributed to the loss despite incredible efforts 
by staff and volunteers to control costs.&nbsp;<br /></p><h3 style="text-align: left;">What’s the solution?</h3><p>In
 an ideal world, we wouldn’t need to pause the Grants Program and would 
instead be granting even MORE awards to our inspiring community. And 
while that’s not currently the case, we do think you can help us unpause
 the grants program and fund the PSF’s other work. <b>The PSF needs more 
support and resources from the corporations that are built on and making
 revenue from Python. As a community, let’s ask corporations to step up 
and sustain the health of the community and programming language they 
rely on.</b> The AI sector, for example, relies heavily on Python and is 
mostly <a href="https://georgiker.com/blog/is-ai-leaving-python-community-behind/" target="_blank">untapped for the PSF, PyCon US, and our entire community</a>. If you 
have potential sponsorship connections (in AI or otherwise) we welcome 
you to send us leads or connect us via sponsors@python.org.&nbsp;<br /><br />The 
PSF is ever grateful for our sponsors, past and current, and we do 
everything we can to make their sponsorships beneficial and rewarding. 
PSF Staff also work hard to make those sponsorship dollars stretch as 
far as they can. Frankly, the PSF simply needs more sponsorship to 
continue to support the astonishing growth of Python and its community.<br /><br />The
 PSF is also incredibly grateful for our individual donors and PSF 
members. We truly couldn’t do this without you. If you’re inspired to 
help because of this post, we urge you to ask your employers to sponsor 
the PSF. Send them the <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/sponsorship/" target="_blank">PSF’s sponsorship page</a>! We know times are 
financially challenging for everyone, but if you’re feeling very 
inspired and in a position to donate, we welcome your contributions via 
the <a href="https://psfmember.org/civicrm/contribute/transact/?reset=1&amp;id=2" target="_blank">PSF’s donation page</a>. You can also join us as a <a href="https://psfmember.org/python-software-foundation-supporting-member-2/" target="_blank">PSF Supporting Member</a>
 (<a href="https://psfmember.org/civicrm/contribute/transact/?reset=1&amp;id=39" target="_blank">a sliding scale is also available!</a>), to invest in the future of Python
 and its community.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Some additional context</h3><p>As PSF Staff reviewed the Q2 numbers for the Grants Program, we found the following:<br /></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li><b>Revived events. </b>10
 out of the 75 (or about 13%) grants applications we’ve received in 2025
 are for “revived” grant applications for events that weren’t run in 
2024 (including one that hasn’t been run since 2015, whoa!).</li><li><b>Net new applications. </b>19
 out of the 75 (or about 25%) grant applications we’ve received in 2025 
are for totally new events and initiatives. While we did expect some 
growth, this is tremendous!</li><li><b>Earlier applications.</b> We 
encouraged folks to apply earlier—and you did, thank you! We weren’t 
expecting this level of awarding by mid-year. We also expect that to 
continue, so we can now plan better for that in the future.</li><li><b>Higher $$ requests.</b> Across all returning applications the amount being requested is about 13% higher than in years previous.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>While
 we expected more interest from the community in the PSF grants program,
 the amount of growth far exceeded our expectations.&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">What’s next?</h3><p>The
 PSF is working on our strategy to balance support for the worldwide 
Python community and funding constraints, now and in the future. The 
unknown and rapidly growing number of new Python events and 
initiatives—combined with the ongoing needs of existing events and 
organizations that have historically relied on the PSF Grants Program—is
 challenging to manage sustainably on a rolling application basis.<br /><br />So, here’s our plan:<br /></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>First, the PSF Board will continue to refine the grant program’s guiding principles and how they translate into program policy.&nbsp;</li><li>From
 there, PSF Staff will research, plan, and implement a quarterly review 
and awarding approach for the PSF Grants Program to provide an equitable
 and financially sustainable process.</li></ul><p>Moving to a quarterly 
review process from the rolling approval process the Grants Program 
currently uses will be a big change! We will do our best to implement 
processes that work well for the community, the Grants Workgroup, and 
PSF Staff.&nbsp;</p><p>Even with our best efforts, we acknowledge that there will be
 learning opportunities around moving to a quarterly review and most 
likely a series of adjustments ahead of us to get things working 
smoothly. Your feedback as grant applicants and recipients will be 
extremely helpful as we take on this journey. During this process, we 
will determine on what timeline we can re-open the Grants Program. You 
can expect updates from us on the future of the PSF Grants Program in 
early 2026.</p>

          <p class="text-base-content">
            <p>You probably know that I love Rust and TypeScript, and I&#8217;m a big proponent of
good typing systems.  One of the reasons I find them useful is that they enable
autocomplete, which is generally a good feature.  Having a well-integrated type
system that makes sense and gives you optimization potential for memory layouts
is generally a good idea.</p>
<p>From that, you&#8217;d naturally think this would also be great for agentic coding
tools.  There&#8217;s clearly some benefit to it.  If you have an agent write
TypeScript and the agent adds types, it performs well.  I don&#8217;t know if it
outperforms raw JavaScript, but at the very least it doesn&#8217;t seem to do any
harm.</p>
<p>But most agentic tools don&#8217;t have access to an LSP (language server protocol).
My experiments with agentic coding tools that do have LSP access (with type
information available) haven&#8217;t meaningfully benefited from it.  The LSP
protocol slows things down and pollutes the context significantly.  Also, the
models haven&#8217;t been trained sufficiently to understand how to work with this
information.  Just getting a type check failure from the compiler in text
form yields better results.</p>
<p>What you end up with is an agent coding loop that, without type checks enabled,
results in the agent making forward progress by writing code and putting types
somewhere.  As long as this compiles to some version of JavaScript (if you use
Bun, much of it ends up type-erased), it creates working code.  And from there
it continues.  But that&#8217;s bad progress—it&#8217;s the type of progress where it
needs to come back after and clean up the types.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s curious because types are obviously being written but they&#8217;re largely
being ignored.  If you do put the type check into the loop, my tests actually
showed worse performance.  That&#8217;s because the agent manages to get the code
running, and only after it&#8217;s done does it run the type check.  Only then, maybe
at a much later point, does it realize it made type errors.  Then it starts
fixing them, maybe goes in a loop, and wastes a ton of context.  If you make it
do the type checks after every single edit, you end up eating even more into the
context.</p>
<p>This gets really bad when the types themselves are incredibly complicated and
non-obvious.  TypeScript has arcane expression functionality, and some
libraries go overboard with complex constructs (e.g., <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/conditional-types.html">conditional
types</a>).
LLMs have little clue how to read any of this.  For instance, if you give it
access to the .d.ts files from TanStack Router and the forward declaration
stuff it uses for the router system to work properly, it doesn&#8217;t understand any
of it.  It guesses, and sometimes guesses badly.  It&#8217;s utterly confused.  When
it runs into type errors, it performs all kinds of manipulations, none of which
are helpful.</p>
<p>Python typing has an even worse problem, because there we have to work with a
very complicated ecosystem where different type checkers cannot even agree on
how type checking should work.  That means that the LLM, at least from my
testing, is not even fully capable of understanding how to resolve type check
errors from tools which are not from mypy.  It&#8217;s not universally bad, but if
you actually end up with a complex type checking error that you cannot resolve
yourself, it is shocking how the LLM is also often not able to fully figure out
what&#8217;s going on, or at least needs multiple attempts.</p>
<p>As a shining example of types adding a lot of value we have Go.  Go&#8217;s types are
much less expressive and very structural.  Things conform to interfaces purely
by having certain methods.  The LLM does not need to understand much to
comprehend that.  Also, the types that Go has are rather strictly enforced.  If
they are wrong, it won&#8217;t compile.  Because Go has a much simpler type system
that doesn&#8217;t support complicated constructs, it works much better—both for LLMs
to understand the code they produce and for the LLM to understand real-world
libraries you might give to an LLM. </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t really know what to do with this, but these behaviors suggest there&#8217;s
a lot more value in best-effort type systems or type hints like JSDoc.  Because
at least as far as the LLM is concerned, it doesn&#8217;t need to fully understand
the types, it just needs to have a rough understanding of what type some object
probably is.  For the LLM it&#8217;s more important that the type name in the error
message aligns with the type name in source.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s an interesting question whether this behavior of LLMs today will
influence future language design.  I don&#8217;t know if it will, but I think it
gives a lot of credence to some of the decisions that led to languages like Go
and Java.  As critical as I have been in the past about their rather simple
approaches to problems and having a design that maybe doesn&#8217;t hold developers
in a particularly high regard, I now think that they actually are measurably in
a very good spot.  There is more elegance to their design than I gave it
credit for.</p>

<h4 id="s-can-you-tell-us-a-little-about-yourself-hobbies-education-etc">Can you tell us a little about yourself (hobbies, education, etc)</h4>
<p>I’m Jake. I’m a Senior Systems Engineer at <a href="https://torchbox.com/">Torchbox</a>, where I’ve been for a little over 4 years. “Systems Engineer” is a fairly loaded title, and means different things to different people. I like to describe it as doing everything technical to do with Software Engineering which isn’t Programming (Sysadmin, Devops, IT support, Security, Networking), but also doing a fair bit of Programming.</p>
<p>Most of my hobbies revolve around technology. I’m an avid self-hoster, running applications on servers both in “the cloud” and in my house. There’s been a server of some kind in my house for the last 10 years. I’m generally quite a private person, so I like to know what’s happening to my data. Since I started working remotely at the start of the 2020 pandemic, I’ve channeled some of this passion into <a href="https://theorangeone.net/posts/">posts on my website</a>, with posts about all manner of things I’ve done from self-hosting to general software engineering.</p>
<p>Away from my desk (sort of), I’m a volunteer for <a href="https://studentrobotics.org/">Student Robotics</a>, inspiring college students into STEM through competitive robotics (no, not quite like Robot Wars). In school, I was always the quiet one, but now I seem completely at home with public speaking, commentary and otherwise being in front of large crowds of people. I wish I knew the secret - I’d make millions!</p>
<p>My <a href="https://github.com/RealOrangeOne/">GitHub</a> is also pretty active, with contributions all over the place (OpenZFS, Nebula VPN, Gitea, Plausible Analytics, OpenCV, Ansible…).</p>
<h4 id="s-im-curious-where-your-nickname-realorangeone-comes-from">I’m curious, where your nickname “RealOrangeOne” comes from?</h4>
<p>Because a lot of life happens online (especially in the last 5 years), many people haven’t even seen pictures of me, let alone met me in person. I am not in fact a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@AnnoyingOrange">talking piece of fruit</a>. For a while, I tried to stay anonymous, avoiding photos or videos of me on the internet. But since I discovered I enjoy public speaking, I’ve sort of given up on that (for the most part).</p>
<p>By now, I’m sure many people have speak. But, for those who don’t know: I, like my father before me, am ginger 🔥 (the hair colour, not the plant).</p>
<p>The exact specifics of how being ginger lead to “TheOrangeOne” are sadly lost to time. I’ve owned <code>theorangeone.net</code> for well over a decade at this point. Unfortunately, it’s not a particularly original nickname, and I have to be fast to claim it when signing up to new services. In some places (where I wasn’t fast enough) I’m forced to sub out “The” for “Real”, which has lead to some confusions, but not too many. Canonically, I prefer “TheOrangeOne”, but as we all know, naming things is hard.</p>
<h4 id="s-how-did-you-start-using-django">How did you start using Django?</h4>
<p>I’ve been using Django since around the 1.8 release. My job at the time was at a Django development agency, so it was the first real Python framework I’d used. The first few weeks there was my first exposure to Django, pip, package management and collaborative software engineering - it was quite a lot to learn at once. I didn’t realise it at the time, but I was working working as a junior alongside a couple fairly well-known names in the Django community like Tom Christie (DRF, Starlette, HTTPX) and Jamie Matthews (django-readers, django-zen-queries). We mostly built single-page apps with React, so I learned Django and Django Rest Framework at the same time, which means I now often have to look back at the docs to remember how forms and templates work.</p>
<p>As for contributing to Django, that came much later. My first commit to Django was in May 2024. Having used Django for a while, and written plenty of packages, I’d never stopped to look at how upstream was developed. Around the time of DEP 14 kicking off, I needed to look a bit more at the inner workings of the Django project, to learn what was in store for me. When scrolling through Trac tickets, I found <a href="https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/35467">an interesting looking ticket</a>, and got to work. At the time of writing, I’ve now closed <a href="https://code.djangoproject.com/query?owner=RealOrangeOne&amp;status=closed">9 Trac tickets</a> across <a href="https://github.com/django/django/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3ARealOrangeOne+is%3Aclosed">12 PRs</a>, and some pretty cool features (simple block tags, better Accept header parsing, performance improvements to the URL router) now have my name on them (metaphorically speaking).</p>
<p>I wouldn’t call myself an “active” contributor, but I try and keep an eye on the tickets and forum threads which interest me the most, and chime in when I can.</p>
<h4 id="s-what-other-framework-do-you-know-and-if-there-is-anything-you-would-like-to-have-in-django-if-you-had-magical-powers">What other framework do you know and if there is anything you would like to have in Django if you had magical powers?</h4>
<p>Since it’s the first framework I learned, and so far has done everything I need, I’ve mostly used Django. For a few smaller services, I’ve leaned more towards <a href="https://www.starlette.io/">Starlette</a> and <a href="https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/index.html">AIOHTTP</a>, but for anything even slightly large I’ve just used Django - since I’d end up recreating much of Django using the smaller frameworks anyway. A better (likely official) path for single-file Django (ie without some of the magic module handling) might help draw a few more people in and fill a few more of these “micro-service” style use-cases.</p>
<p>I’m a <a href="https://ccbv.co.uk/">class-based views</a> person - I like the encapsulation and easy extension of base views. As with any opinion on the internet, I’m sure many people disagree with me, but to me it’s just personal preference. I’m still surprised it’s a pattern not seen by many other Python frameworks.</p>
<p>Following in the footsteps of Python, I often wonder if Django could also do with some <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0594/">dead battery removal</a> (or at least extracting into separate packages). Django is a pretty big framework, and whilst the contrib apps are intended to be separate, they also require hooks and assumptions in other areas of the codebase. I might be wrong (it happens quite a lot), but I suspect some of those packages would be better suited externally, perhaps improving some developer momentum - and lightening the load for the Fellows. Django’s sitemap and syndication (RSS) frameworks are 2 places I wish would get some more love.</p>
<p>Outside of Python, I’m a big fan of Rust (as cliche as it may be). Whilst Rust is a popular language, there isn’t really a “Django” like (batteries included) framework - it’s all composing the pieces you need yourself. However, that doesn’t stop people being very productive with it. As a result, most of the frameworks have very generic interfaces, letting developers pass state around as needed, rather than trying to do everything themselves. Outside of the obvious static typing debate (which I’m in favour of), I’d love to see Django embrace some dependencies, especially if they bring some performance improvements. It may end up being a bad idea, but it might also help those who want to use Django’s modules outside of Django.</p>
<p>Many years ago, I tried to be a polyglot - switching between different programming languages (and frameworks) to find new ways of working and match the problem to the correct solution. Now, I’ve settled mostly on Python and Rust. They fit my needs well, I’m very productive in them, and between the 2 there’s not much they can’t handle. Given my background, and the fact most sysadmin-y tools are written in it, I’m really not a fan of Go.</p>
<h4 id="s-what-projects-are-you-working-on-now">What projects are you working on now?</h4>
<p>Over time, I’ve slowly stepped back from having big side projects - being a new dad sure takes up time and energy. Large projects ended up feeling too much like work outside of work, and I end up either getting distracted or bored. After work, I want to do something fun, not that seems like yet another job. I’m the kind of person who gets the sudden urge to research something interesting for an evening, dive in, then not think about it again for several weeks. It’s not the most productive way of doing things, which is why my posts are all over the place, but it doesn’t feel much like work for me - I lean heavily on what interests me at any time to drive what I want to do.</p>
<p>With that said, I’m currently in the process of rebuilding <a href="https://theorangeone.net/">my website</a>. Of course, both the current and new versions are built on Django, but the new build should be easier to maintain, faster, and hopefully won’t need rewriting again in just a couple years. Most of my other projects have been small tools to make my home server that bit nicer.</p>
<p>Professionally, I’m not really a developer anymore. As a sysadmin (ish), much of my day-to-day doesn’t involve much programming. I spend much more of my time deploying, monitoring and administering Django applications than I do writing them. My main project at the moment is helping port a large Java / JS deployment over to Django and Wagtail, running on Kubernetes with some very high and interesting stability and scaling requirements. Since most of my professional live has been at software agencies, I’ve tended to bounce between different projects, rather than sitting on a single one. So I’m also supporting on a few other smaller projects as and when I’m needed.</p>
<h4 id="s-which-django-libraries-are-your-favorite-core-or-3rd-party">Which Django libraries are your favorite (core or 3rd party)?</h4>
<p><a href="https://github.com/RealOrangeOne/django-tasks">django-tasks</a>, of course!</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Oh right, a serious answer…</p>
<p>I have to say, one of the most underrated modules in Django is <code>django.utils</code>. It’s not as glamourous as the ORM, forms or cache, but it’s a treasure trove of useful methods. I personally always like looking at the internal helper functions large frameworks use - see the problems they’ve had to solve time and time again. Whilst there’s not the same stability guarantees, I’ve definitely been helped out on a few occasions by some undocumented functions.</p>
<p>In that theme, I’m a fan of libraries which do one thing and do it well. I quite like small libraries which aim to solve a problem. There’s definitely a line before that becomes a problem (anyone remember <code>left-pad</code>?), but libraries which scope creep are often harder to work with than the more narrow-scoped ones, whilst the smaller ones just keep on working and making my life easier. For example, <a href="https://django-environ.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">django-environ</a> makes reading and parsing environment variables into settings really easy and clean, and <a href="https://pypi.org/project/django-decorator-include/">django-decorator-include</a> helps including other <code>urlpatterns</code> whilst wrapping them in a decorator - particularly helpful for 3rd-party package’s URLs.</p>
<p>Finally, I’ve got a real soft-spot for <a href="https://whitenoise.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">whitenoise</a> (and ServeStatic for <a href="https://archmonger.github.io/ServeStatic/latest/">ASGI</a> users). Django’s documentation deters people pretty hard from serving media and static files using Django - and rightly so in performance-critical environments. However, for most people, having to additionally maintain (and secure) <code>nginx</code> is more maintenance than necessary. <code>whitenoise</code> serves static files using Django directly, without any extra configuration, whilst also pre-compressing files for a nice performance boost. To me, it’s such a universally-useful library, I’d love to see it it included in Django itself someday.</p>
<p>I’ll throw a bonus shout out for <a href="https://github.com/emmett-framework/granian">granian</a>, a new (ish) WSGI / ASGI server written in Rust. <a href="https://docs.gunicorn.org/en/stable/">gunicorn</a> has a near monopoly on running Python apps in production, especially in the WSGI space, so it’s nice to see a newcomer. granian isn’t always faster, but doing the HTTP handling in Rust (and using popular libraries to do it) can improve stability and throughput, without holding the GIL. I’ve not run anything in production with it yet, but I’ve been using it on personal projects for almost a year without issue.</p>
<h4 id="s-what-are-the-top-three-things-in-django-that-you-like">What are the top three things in Django that you like?</h4>
<p>Contrary to what I’ve already said, I actually like Django’s batteries. Sure, there’s quite a few “dead” ones in need of some cleaning up and TLC, but having most of what I need already installed makes me far more productive. I don’t need to think about how to render my form on the page, save the results as a model, or properly handle errors - everything “just works”, and works together. Sure, batteries have their downsides - it makes swapping them out rather difficult, but I’d rather ship my feature sooner than compare the trade-offs of different ORMs. The auto-reloading in <code>django-tasks</code> is only around <a href="https://github.com/RealOrangeOne/django-tasks/pull/152/files#diff-014cdd86e0b6702bf4fc2bc785082586d7546e29405f465026ac9eb51cb341e9R260-R268">8 lines of code</a> thanks to <code>django.utils.autoreload</code> being so easy to hook in to.</p>
<p>Secondly: Forms, but not for the reasons you might think. Most forms are created to take submissions from the user, validate them, then probably save them to a model. However, they’re great as general data validation. I’ve written plenty of views with complex querystring requirements, and leaning on forms to validate them saves a lot of boilerplate code. Sure, <code>pydantic</code> might be a bit faster and have more features, but given I’m already productive with <code>django.forms</code>, and it’s already installed and well understood by other developers in my team, I don’t feel the need to reach for something else.</p>
<p>Finally, I wouldn’t say it’s quite a “favourite”, and it’s well-known as being far-from-perfect, but I’ve got a real soft-spot for the Django Admin. It lets me focus on building the core of an application, rather than the internal interface - particularly when there are no strong requirements for it, or it’s only going to be used by me and a few others. Since it’s a fair raw view of the database by default, I’ve definitely been bitten by some less-than-restrictive permissions, but there’s generally all the hooks I need. I don’t like building frontends, so only needing to build 1 rather than 2 makes me a lot happier, especially if it comes with authentication, permissions, read-only views and a dark mode 😎!</p>
<h4 id="s-how-did-you-join-the-security-team">How did you join the security team?</h4>
<p>I’d love to say it’s an interesting story, stroking my ego that I saved the day. But the reality is, as usual, far less glamorous.</p>
<p>As an engineer, I’ve tended towards 2 specialties: Security and Performance, which usually go hand-in-hand. In early 2023, I was invited to join the <a href="https://wagtail.org/">Wagtail CMS</a> Security team after reporting and subsequently helping fix a <a href="https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/security/advisories/GHSA-33pv-vcgh-jfg9">memory exhaustion issue</a>. I was already involved in all things security at Torchbox, especially our ISO-27001 certification, so I was already known when I submitted a vulnerability report.</p>
<p>Thibaud mentioned to me late last year that the project potentially looking for new members of the security team, to help with resourcing and some potential process improvements within the foundation. I naturally jumped at the opportunity - since the team is generally closed to new members and “fully-staffed”. After a few gentle reminders (he’s a busy guy), I received a message from Sarah formally inviting me in March.</p>
<p>Since then, I’ve tried to review every report which came through, and helped author a few patches. A few reports even had to be raised upstream with Python’s <a href="https://devguide.python.org/developer-workflow/psrt/">Security Response Team</a> (PSRT). It’s been an interesting experience, and I’m looking forward to seeing how the team developers over the coming years.</p>
<h4 id="s-im-aware-that-you-have-created-dep-14-on-the-background-workers-how-the-work-is-going-so-far-do-you-need-support-from-the-community-on-anything">I’m aware that you have created DEP 14 on the Background Workers, how the work is going so far? Do you need support from the community on anything?</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2024/may/29/django-enhancement-proposal-14-background-workers/">DEP 14</a> (the proposal to add a native background workers API to Django) has been a really interesting journey. I’m beyond humbled to see the community interest behind it. When I started down this road, I’d only intended to start the conversations and help rally the community interest. Since then, and 6000 lines of code later, I’m mostly single-handedly writing a database-backed production-grade task system.</p>
<p>Right now, we’re at a bit of a cross-roads. Many of the foundational parts work, relatively well. The difficulty comes with the more complex features: Retries, dependencies, robust execution. Building a task system is easy - building a reliable one people want to actually use is incredibly difficult. If anyone out there is interested in getting involved, please do! <a href="https://github.com/realOrangeOne/django-tasks">Report issues</a>, fix bugs, <a href="https://github.com/RealOrangeOne/django-tasks/discussions">contribute to design discussions</a>. Most of the APIs are based on what I think looks sensible. Software this large, pivotal and complex can’t be built in isolation - so it needs a diverse audience to ensure we (I) make the right decisions, and design an API people actually want to use that will last and scale for years to come.</p>
<p>The next challenge on my list to tackle is timeouts - a highly requested feature. It sounds simple, but the reality is far from it. Many of those challenges sparked the topic of my upcoming <a href="https://2025.pyconuk.org/">PyCon UK</a> talk later this year.</p>
<h4 id="s-django-is-celebrating-its-20th-anniversary-this-month-any-nice-story-to-share">Django is celebrating its 20th anniversary this month. Any nice story to share?</h4>
<p>My personal highlight was <a href="https://2024.djangocon.eu/">DjangoCon Europe 2024</a> - my first DjangoCon. I ended up bringing the stereotypically grey British weather with me, but I had a great week chatting Django with some interesting people, and putting faces to the names and handles I’d seen online. After the <a href="https://theorangeone.net/talks/empowering-django-with-background-workers/">talk</a> announcing DEP 14 and background tasks, I was inundated with people voicing their support - many wondering how it’d taken this long.</p>
<p>But personally, I’m more interested in what’s to come. Of course, there’s <code>django-tasks</code>, but the next sets of releases are shaping up to be pretty interesting. Over the last 3-4 years or so, I’ve personally noticed a bit of a resurgence in people’s <a href="https://github.com/django/new-features/issues">appetites for change</a> in Django. The 6.x Steering Council have a lot of interesting ideas, and clearly the community agree. People are happy with what Django can do now, but want to bring it a little more up-to-date - and are happy to put in the work to do it. Only a few weeks ago, <a href="https://github.com/django/django/pull/19393">django-csp was included in core</a>, making it easier to make more secure applications. I’m sure that’s just the start. The fact people are still keen on working on a framework which just celebrated 20 years shows it must be doing something right!</p>
<h4 id="s-is-there-anything-else-youd-like-to-say">Is there anything else you’d like to say?</h4>
<p>I’d like to thank whoever nominated me to be a DSF member in the first place. To this date, I have no idea who you are.</p>
<p>Beyond that, I’m just looking forward to seeing what comes of Django, and Python in general over the next few years.</p>

<h2><img src="https://wingware.com/images/wing18.png" /> New in Wing 11</h2><h3>Improved AI Assisted Development</h3><p>Wing 11 improves the user interface for AI assisted development by introducing two separate
tools <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span> <span class="pre">Coder</span></tt> and <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span> <span class="pre">Chat</span></tt>. <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span> <span class="pre">Coder</span></tt> can be used to write, redesign, or extend code
in the current editor. <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span> <span class="pre">Chat</span></tt> can be used to ask about code or iterate in creating a
design or new code without directly modifying the code in an editor.</p>
<p>Wing 11's AI assisted development features now support not just OpenAI but also Claude, Grok,
Gemini, Perplexity, Mistral, Deepseek, and any other OpenAI completions API compatible AI provider.</p>
<p>This release also improves setting up AI request context, so that both automatically and
manually selected and described context items may be paired with an AI request. AI request
contexts can now be stored, optionally so they are shared by all projects, and may be used
independently with different AI features.</p>
<p>AI requests can now also be stored in the current project or shared with all projects, and Wing
comes preconfigured with a set of commonly used requests. In addition to changing code in the
current editor, stored requests may create a new untitled file or run instead in AI Chat. Wing
11 also introduces options for changing code within an editor, including replacing code,
commenting out code, or starting a diff/merge session to either accept or reject changes.</p>
<p>Wing 11 also supports using AI to generate commit messages based on the changes being committed
to a revision control system.</p>
<p>You can now also configure multiple AI providers for easier access to different models.</p>
<p>For details see <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span> <span class="pre">Assisted</span> <span class="pre">Development</span></tt> under <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Wing</span> <span class="pre">Manual</span></tt> in Wing 11's <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Help</span></tt> menu.</p>
<h3>Package Management with uv </h3><p>Wing Pro 11 adds support for the <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">uv</span></tt> package manager in the New Project dialog and the
Packages tool.</p>
<p>For details see <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Project</span> <span class="pre">Manager</span> <span class="pre">&gt;</span> <span class="pre">Creating</span> <span class="pre">Projects</span> <span class="pre">&gt;</span> <span class="pre">Creating</span> <span class="pre">Python</span> <span class="pre">Environments</span></tt> and <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Package</span>

<h3>Improved Python Code Analysis</h3><p>Wing 11 makes substantial improvements to Python code analysis, with better support for
literals such as dicts and sets, parametrized type aliases, <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">typing.Self</span></tt>, type of
variables on the <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">def</span></tt> or <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">class</span></tt> line that declares them, generic classes with
<tt class="literal"><span class="pre">[...]</span></tt>, <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">__all__</span></tt> in <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">*.pyi</span></tt> files, subscripts in <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">typing.Type</span></tt> and similar, type
aliases, type hints in strings, <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">type[...]</span></tt> and <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">tuple[...]</span></tt>,
<tt class="literal"><span class="pre">&#64;functools.cached_property</span></tt>, base classes found also in <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">.pyi</span></tt> files, and
<tt class="literal"><span class="pre">typing.Literal[...]</span></tt>.</p>
<h3>Updated Localizations</h3><p>Wing 11 updates the German, French, and Russian localizations, and introduces a new experimental
AI-generated Spanish localization. The Spanish localization and the new AI-generated strings in the
French and Russian localizations may be accessed with the new <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">User</span> <span class="pre">Interface</span> <span class="pre">&gt;</span> <span class="pre">Include</span> <span class="pre">AI</span>
<span class="pre">Translated</span> <span class="pre">Strings</span></tt> preference.</p>
<h3>Improved diff/merge</h3><p>Wing Pro 11 adds floating buttons directly between the editors to make navigating differences
and merging easier, allows undoing previously merged changes, and does a better job managing
scratch buffers, scroll locking, and sizing of merged ranges.</p>
<p>For details see <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Difference</span> <span class="pre">and</span> <span class="pre">Merge</span></tt> under <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Wing</span> <span class="pre">Manual</span></tt> in Wing 11's <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Help</span></tt> menu.</p>
<h3>Other Minor Features and Improvements</h3><p>Wing 11 also improves the custom key binding assignment user interface, adds a <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Files</span> <span class="pre">&gt;</span>
<span class="pre">Auto-Save</span> <span class="pre">Files</span> <span class="pre">When</span> <span class="pre">Wing</span> <span class="pre">Loses</span> <span class="pre">Focus</span></tt> preference, warns immediately when opening a project with
an invalid Python Executable configuration, allows clearing recent menus, expands the set of
available special environment variables for project configuration, and makes a number of other
bug fixes and usability improvements.</p>
<h3>Changes and Incompatibilities</h3><p>Since Wing 11 replaced the <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span></tt> tool with <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span> <span class="pre">Coder</span></tt> and <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span> <span class="pre">Chat</span></tt>, and AI
configuration is completely different than in Wing 10, you will need to reconfigure your
AI integration manually in Wing 11. This is done with <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Manage</span> <span class="pre">AI</span> <span class="pre">Providers</span></tt> in the
<tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span></tt> menu. After adding the first provider configuration, Wing will set that provider as
the default. You can switch between providers with <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Switch</span> <span class="pre">to</span> <span class="pre">Provider</span></tt> in the <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span></tt> menu.</p>

    <h2>A function defined within a function</h2>
    
      
        <p>Python's functions can be defined <em>pretty much anywhere</em>.</p>

      
        <p>You can even define a function inside a function:</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">greet_me</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"friend"</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">greet</span><span class="p">():</span>
        <span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"Hello"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">name</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">greet</span><span class="p">()</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>When we call this <code>greet_me</code> function, it defines a <code>greet</code> a function and then calls that function:</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">greet_me</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="go">Hello friend</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>Note that the inner function is allowed to use the <code>name</code> from the outer function.</p>

      
    
  
    <h2>A function returned from another function</h2>
    
      <p>Instead of calling our inner …</p>

            >
          </h2>
          
        </div>

        <!-- Content Section -->
        <div class="p-4 flex-grow overflow-hidden">
          <p class="text-base-content">
            <p>Using Claude Code and other agentic coding tools has become all the rage.  Not
only is it getting <a href="https://npmtrends.com/@anthropic-ai/claude-code-vs-@sentry/react">millions of
downloads</a>,
but these tools are also gaining features that help streamline workflows.  As
you know, <a href="/2025/6/4/changes/">I got very excited</a> about agentic coding in May,
and I&#8217;ve tried many of the new features that have been added.  I&#8217;ve spent
considerable time exploring everything on my plate.</p>
<p>But oddly enough, very little of what I attempted I ended up sticking with.
Most of my attempts didn&#8217;t last, and I thought it might be interesting to share
what didn&#8217;t work.  This doesn&#8217;t mean these approaches won&#8217;t work or are bad
ideas; it just means I didn&#8217;t manage to make them work.  Maybe there&#8217;s
something to learn from these failures for others.</p>
<h2>Rules of Automation</h2>
<p>The best way to think about the approach that I use is:</p>
<ol>
<li>I only automate things that I do regularly.</li>
<li>If I create an automation for something that I do regularly, but then I stop
using the automation, I consider it a failed automation and I delete it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Non-working automations turn out to be quite common.  Either I can&#8217;t get myself
to use them, I forget about them, or I end up fine-tuning them endlessly.  For
me, deleting a failed workflow helper is crucial.  You don&#8217;t want unused Claude
commands cluttering your workspace and confusing others.</p>
<p>So I end up doing the simplest thing possible most of the time: just talk to
the machine more, give it more context, keep the audio input going, and dump my
train of thought into the prompt.  And that is 95% of my workflow.  The rest might
be good use of copy/paste.</p>
<h2>Slash Commands</h2>
<p>Slash commands allow you to preload prompts to have them readily available in a
session.  I expected these to be more useful than they ended up being.  I do
use them, but many of the ones that I added I ended up never using.</p>
<p>There are some limitations with slash commands that make them less useful than
they could be.  One limitation is that there&#8217;s only one way to pass arguments,
and it&#8217;s unstructured.  This proves suboptimal in practice for my uses.
Another issue I keep running into with Claude Code is that if you do use a
slash command, the argument to the slash command for some reason <a href="https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/818">does not
support file-based
autocomplete</a>.</p>
<p>To make them work better, I often ask Claude to use the current Git state to
determine which files to operate on.  For instance, I have a command in this
blog that fixes grammar mistakes.  It operates almost entirely from the current
git status context because providing filenames explicitly is tedious without
autocomplete.</p>
<p>Here is one of the few slash commands I actually do use:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gu">## Context</span>

<span class="k">-</span><span class="w"> </span>git status: !<span class="sb">`git status`</span>
<span class="k">-</span><span class="w"> </span>Explicitly mentioned file to fix: &quot;$ARGUMENTS&quot;

<span class="gu">## Your task</span>

Based on the above information, I want you to edit the mentioned file or files
for grammar mistakes.  Make a backup (eg: change file.md to file.md.bak) so I
can diff it later.  If the backup file already exists, delete it.

If a blog post was explicitly provided, edit that; otherwise, edit the ones
that have pending changes or are untracked.
</pre></div>
<p>My workflow now assumes that Claude can determine which files I mean from the
Git status virtually every time, making explicit arguments largely unnecessary.</p>
<p>Here are some of the many slash commands that I built at one point but ended
up not using:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>/fix-bug</code>: I had a command that instructed Claude to fix bugs by pulling
issues from GitHub and adding extra context. But I saw no meaningful
improvement over simply mentioning the GitHub issue URL and voicing my
thoughts about how to fix it.</li>
<li><code>/commit</code>: I tried getting Claude to write good commit messages, but
they never matched my style. I stopped using this command, though I haven&#8217;t
given up on the idea entirely.</li>
<li><code>/add-tests</code>: I really hoped this would work. My idea was to have Claude
skip tests during development, then use an elaborate reusable prompt to
generate them properly at the end. But this approach wasn&#8217;t consistently better
than automatic test generation, which I&#8217;m still not satisfied with overall.</li>
<li><code>/fix-nits</code>: I had a command to fix linting issues and run formatters.
I stopped using it because it never became muscle memory, and Claude
already knows how to do this. I can just tell it &#8220;fix lint&#8221; in the
CLAUDE.md file without needing a slash command.</li>
<li><code>/next-todo</code>: I track small items in a to-do.md file
and had a command to pull the next item and work on it. Even
here, workflow automation didn&#8217;t help much.
I use this command far less than expected.</li>
</ul>
<p>So if I&#8217;m using fewer slash commands, what am I doing instead?</p>
<ol>
<li>Speech-to-text.  Cannot stress this enough but talking to the machine means
you&#8217;re more likely to share more about what you want it to do.</li>
<li>I maintain some basic prompts and context for copy-pasting at the end or the
beginning of what I entered.</li>
</ol>
<p>Copy/paste is really, really useful because of how fuzzy LLMs are.  For
instance, I maintain link collections that I paste in when needed.  Sometimes I
fetch files proactively, drop them into a git-ignored folder, and mention them.
It&#8217;s simple, easy, and effective.  You still need to be somewhat selective to
avoid polluting your context too much, but compared to having it spelunk in the wrong
places, more text doesn&#8217;t harm as much.</p>
<h2>Hooks</h2>
<p>I tried hard to make hooks work, but I haven&#8217;t seen any efficiency gains from
them yet.  I think part of the problem is that I use yolo mode.  I wish hooks
could actually manipulate what gets executed.  The only way to guide Claude
today is through denies, which don&#8217;t work in yolo mode.  For instance, I tried
using hooks to make it use uv instead of regular Python, but I was unable to do
so.  Instead, I ended up preloading executables on the PATH that override the
default ones, steering Claude toward the right tools.</p>
<p>For instance, this is really my hack for making it use <code>uv run python</code> instead
of <code>python</code> more reliably:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="ch">#!/bin/sh</span>
<span class="nb">echo</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;This project uses uv, please use 'uv run python' instead.&quot;</span>
<span class="nb">exit</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="m">1</span>
</pre></div>
<p>I really just have a bunch of these in <code>.claude/interceptors</code> and preload that
folder onto <code>PATH</code> before launching Claude:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nv">CLAUDE_BASH_MAINTAIN_PROJECT_WORKING_DIR</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="m">1</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="se">\</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nv">PATH</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;`pwd`/.claude/interceptors:</span><span class="si">${</span><span class="nv">PATH</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="se">\</span>
<span class="w">    </span>claude<span class="w"> </span>--dangerously-skip-permissions
</pre></div>
<p>I also found it hard to hook into the right moment.  I wish I could run
formatters at the end of a long edit session.  Currently, you must run
formatters after each Edit tool operation, which often forces Claude to re-read
files, wasting context. Even with the Edit tool hook, I&#8217;m not sure if I&#8217;m
going to keep using it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m actually really curious whether people manage to get good use out of hooks.
I&#8217;ve seen some discussions on Twitter that suggest there are some really good
ways of making them work, but I just went with much simpler solutions instead.</p>
<h2>Claude Print Mode</h2>
<p>I was initially very bullish on Claude&#8217;s print mode.  I tried hard to have
Claude generate scripts that used print mode internally.  For instance, I had
it create a mock data loading script — mostly deterministic code with a
small inference component to generate test data using Claude Code. </p>
<p>The challenge is achieving reliability, which hasn&#8217;t worked well for me yet.
Print mode is slow and difficult to debug.  So I use it far less than I&#8217;d like,
despite loving the concept of mostly deterministic scripts with small inference
components.  Whether using the Claude SDK or the command-line print flag, I
haven&#8217;t achieved the results I hoped for. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m drawn to Print Mode because inference is too much like a slot machine.
Many programming tasks are actually quite rigid and deterministic.  We love
linters and formatters because they&#8217;re unambiguous.  Anything we can fully
automate, we should.  Using an LLM for tasks that don&#8217;t require inference is
the wrong approach in my book.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what makes print mode appealing.  If only it worked better.  Use
an LLM for the commit message, but regular scripts for the commit and gh pr
commands.  Make mock data loading 90% deterministic with only 10% inference.</p>
<p>I still use it, but I see more potential than I am currently leveraging.</p>
<h2>Sub Tasks and Sub Agents</h2>
<p>I use the task tool frequently for basic parallelization and context isolation.
Anthropic recently launched an agents feature meant to streamline this process,
but I haven&#8217;t found it easier to use.</p>
<p>Sub-tasks and sub-agents enable parallelism, but you must be careful.  Tasks
that don&#8217;t parallelize well — especially those mixing reads and writes — create
chaos.  Outside of investigative tasks, I don&#8217;t get good results.  While
sub-agents should preserve context better, I often get better results by
starting new sessions, writing thoughts to Markdown files, or even switching to
o3 in the chat interface.</p>
<h2>Does It Help?</h2>
<p>What&#8217;s interesting about workflow automation is that without rigorous rules
that you consistently follow as a developer, simply taking time to talk to the
machine and give clear instructions outperforms elaborate pre-written prompts.</p>
<p>For instance, I don&#8217;t use emojis or commit prefixes.  I don&#8217;t enforce templates
for pull requests either.  As a result, there&#8217;s less structure for me to teach
the machine.</p>
<p>I also lack the time and motivation to thoroughly evaluate all my created
workflows.  This prevents me from gaining confidence in their value.</p>
<p>Context engineering and management remain major challenges.  Despite my efforts
to help agents pull the right data from various files and commands, they don&#8217;t
yet succeed reliably.  They pull in too much or too little.  Long sessions lead
to forgotten context from the beginning.  Whether done manually or with slash
commands, the results feel too random.  It&#8217;s hard enough with ad-hoc
approaches, but static prompts and commands make it even harder.</p>
<p>The rule I have now is that if I do want to automate something, I must have done it a
few times already, and then I evaluate whether the agent gets any better results
through my automation.  There&#8217;s no exact science to it, but I mostly measure
that right now by letting it do the same task three times and looking at the variance
manually as measured by: would I accept the result.</p>
<h2>Keeping The Brain On</h2>
<p>Forcing myself to evaluate the automation has another benefit: I&#8217;m less likely to
just blindly assume it helps me.</p>
<p>Because there is a big hidden risk with automation through LLMs: it encourages
mental disengagement.  When you stop thinking like an engineer, quality drops,
time gets wasted and you don&#8217;t understand and learn.  LLMs are already bad
enough as they are, but whenever I lean in on automation I notice that it
becomes even easier to disengage.  I tend to overestimate the agent&#8217;s
capabilities with time.  There are real dragons there!</p>
<p>You can still review things as they land, but it becomes increasingly harder to
do so later.  While LLMs are reducing the cost of refactoring, the cost doesn&#8217;t
drop to zero, and regressions are common.</p>
