            <p>There is currently an effort underway to build a new universal lockfile
standard for Python, most of which is taking place on the Python
discussion forum.  This initiative has highlighted the difficulty of
creating a standard that satisfies everyone.  It has become clear that
different Python packaging tools are having slightly different ideas in
mind of what a lockfile is supposed to look like or even be used for.</p>
<p>In those discussions however also a small other aspect re-emerged: Python
has a metadata problem.  Python's metadata system is too complex and
suffers from what I would call “lack of constraints”.</p>
<div class="section" id="javascript-example-of-useful-constraints">
<h2>JavaScript: Example of Useful Constraints</h2>
<p>JavaScript provides an excellent example of how constraints can simplify
and improve a system.  In JavaScript, metadata is straightforward.
Whether you develop against a package locally or if you are using a
package from npm, metadata represents itself the same way.  There is a
single <cite>package.json</cite> file that contains the most important metadata of a
package such as <cite>name</cite>, <cite>version</cite> or <cite>dependencies</cite>.  This simplicity
imposes significant but beneficial constraints:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>There is a 1:1 relationship between an npm package and its metadata.
Every npm package has a single <cite>package.json</cite> file that is the source of
truth of metadata.  Metadata is trivially accessible, even
programmatically, via <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">require('packageName/package.json')</span></tt>.</li>
<li>Dependencies (and all other metadata) are consistent across platforms
and architectures.  Platform-specific binaries are handled via a filter
mechanism (<cite>os</cite> and <cite>cpu</cite>) paired with <cite>optionalDependencies</cite>. <a class="footnote-reference" href="http://lucumr.pocoo.org/feed.atom#footnote-1" id="footnote-reference-1">[1]</a></li>
<li>All metadata is static, and updates require explicit changes to
<cite>package.json</cite> prior to distribution or installation.  Tools are
provided to manipulate that metadata such as <tt class="docutils literal">npm version patch</tt>
which will edit the file in-place.</li>
</ul>
<p>These constraints offer several benefits:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Uniform behavior regardless of whether a dependency is installed locally
or from a remote source.  There is not even a filesystem layout difference
between what comes from git or npm.  This enables things like replacing
an installed dependency with a local development copy, without change in
functionality.</li>
<li>There is one singular source of truth for all metadata.  You can edit
<cite>package.json</cite> and any consumer of that metadata can just monitor that
file for changes.  No complex external information needs to be
consulted.</li>
<li>Resolvers can rely on a single API call to fetch dependency metadata for
a version, improving efficiency.  Practically this also means that the
resolver only needs to hit a single URL to retrieve all possible
dependencies of a dependency. <a class="footnote-reference" href="http://lucumr.pocoo.org/feed.atom#footnote-2" id="footnote-reference-2">[2]</a></li>
<li>It makes auditing much easier because there are fewer moving parts and
just one canonical location for metadata.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="python-the-cost-of-too-few-constraints">
<h2>Python: The Cost of Too Few Constraints</h2>
<p>In contrast, Python has historically placed very few constraints on
metadata.  For example, the old <cite>setup.py</cite> based build system essentially
allowed arbitrary code execution during the build process.  At one point
it was at least strongly suggested that the <cite>version</cite> produced by that
build step better match what is uploaded to PyPI.  However, in practice,
if you lie about the version that is okay too.  You could upload a source
distribution to PyPI that claims it's <cite>2.0</cite> but will in fact install
<cite>2.0+somethinghere</cite> or a completely different version entirely.</p>
<p>What happens is that both before a package is published to PyPI and when a
package is installed locally after downloading, the metadata is generated
from scratch.  Not only does that mean the metadata does not have to
match, it also means that it's allowed to be completely different.  It's
absolutely okay for a package to claim it depends on <cite>cool-dependency</cite> on
your machine, but on <cite>uncool-dependency</cite> on my machine.  Or to dependent
on different packages depending on the time of the day of the phase of the
moon.</p>
<p>Editable installs and caching are particularly problematic since metadata
could become invalid almost immediately after being written. <a class="footnote-reference" href="http://lucumr.pocoo.org/feed.atom#footnote-3" id="footnote-reference-3">[3]</a></p>
<p>Some of this has been somewhat improved because the new <cite>pyproject.toml</cite>
standard encourages static metadata.  However build systems are entirely
allowed to override that by falling back to what is called “dynamic
metadata” and this is something that is commonly done.</p>
<p>In practice this system incurs a tremendous tax to everybody that can be
easily missed.</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Disjointed and complex metadata access:</strong> there is no clear
relationship of PyPI package name and the installed Python modules.
If you know what the PyPI package name is, you can access metadata via
<tt class="docutils literal">importlib.metadata</tt>.  Metadata is not read from <cite>pyproject.toml</cite>,
even if it's static, instead it takes the package name and it accesses
the metadata from the <cite>.dist-info</cite> folder (most specifically the
<cite>METADATA</cite> file therein) installed into <cite>site-packages</cite>.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Mandatory metadata re-generation:</strong> As a consequence if you edit
<cite>pyproject.toml</cite> to edit a piece of metadata, you need to re-install the
package for that metadata to be updated in the <cite>.dist-info</cite>.  People
commonly forget doing that, so desynchronized metadata is very common.
This is true even for static metadata today!</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Unclear cache invalidation:</strong> Because metadata can be dynamic, it's not
clear when you should automatically re-install a package.  It's not
enough to just track <cite>pyproject.toml</cite> for changes when dynamic metadata
is used.  <cite>uv</cite> for instance has a really complex, explicit <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/cache/#dynamic-metadata">cache
management system</a> so one
can help uv detect outdated metadata.  This obviously is
non-standardized, requires uv to understand version control systems and
is also not shared with other tools.  For instance if you know that the
version information incorporates the git hash, you can tell uv to pay
attention to git commits.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Fragmented metadata storage:</strong> even where generated metadata is stored
is complex.  Different systems have slightly different behavior for
storing that metadata.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>When working locally (eg: editable installs) what happens depends
on the build system:<ul>
<li>If <cite>setuptools</cite> is used, metadata written into two locations.
The legacy
<cite>&lt;PACKAGE_NAME&gt;.egg-info/PKG-INFO</cite> file.  Additionally it's placed
in the new location for metadata inside <cite>site-packages</cite> in a
<cite>&lt;PACKAGE_NAME&gt;.dist-info/METADATA</cite> file.</li>
<li>If <cite>hatch</cite> and most other modern build systems are used, metadata is
only written into <cite>site-packages</cite>. (into
<cite>&lt;PACKAGE_NAME&gt;.dist-info/METADATA</cite>)</li>
<li>If no build system is configured it depends a bit on the
installer.  pip will even for an editable install build a
wheel with <cite>setuptools</cite>, <cite>uv</cite> will only build a wheel and make
the metadata available if one runs <cite>uv build</cite>.  Otherwise the
metadata is not available (in theory it could be found in
<cite>pyproject.toml</cite> for as long as it's not dynamic).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For source distributions (<cite>sdist</cite>) first the build step happens as
in the section before.  Afterwards the metadata is thrown into a
<cite>PKG-INFO</cite> file.  It's currently placed in two locations in the
<cite>sdist</cite>: <cite>PKG-INFO</cite> in the root and <cite>&lt;PACKAGE_NAME&gt;.egg-info/PKG-INFO</cite>.
That metadata however I believe is only used for PyPI, when
installing the <cite>sdist</cite> locally the metadata is regenerated from
<cite>pyproject.toml</cite> (or if setuptools is used <cite>setup.py</cite>).  That's
also why metadata can change from what's in the sdist to what's
there after installation.</li>
<li>For wheels the metadata is placed in
<cite>&lt;PACKAGE_NAME&gt;.dist-info/METADATA</cite> exclusively.  Wheels have
static metadata, so no build step is taking place.  What is in the
wheel is always used.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Dynamic metadata makes resolvers slow:</strong> Dynamic metadata makes the
job of resolvers and installers very hard and slows them down.  Today
for instance advanced resolvers like poetry or uv sometimes are not able
to install the right packages, because they assume that dependency
metadata is consistent across sdists and wheels.  However there are a
lot of sdists available on PyPI that publish incomplete dependency
metadata (just whatever the build step for the sdist created on the
developer's machine is what is cached on PyPI).</p>
<p>Not getting this right can be the difference of hitting one static URL
with all the metadata, and downloading a zip file, creating a
virtualenv, installing build dependencies, generating an entire sdist
and then reading the final generated metadata.  Many orders of magnitude
difference in time it takes to execute.</p>
<p>This also extends to caching.  If the metadata can constantly change,
how would a resolver cache it?  Is it required to build all possible
source distributions to determine the metadata as part of resolving?</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Cognitive complexity:</strong> The system introduces an enormous cognitive
overhead which makes it very hard to understand for users, particularly
when things to wrong.  Incorrectly cached metadata can be almost
impossible to debug for a user because they do not understand what is
going on.  Their <cite>pyproject.toml</cite> shows the right information, yet for
some reason it behaves incorrectly.  Most people don't know what &quot;egg
info&quot; or &quot;dist info&quot; is.  Or why an sdist has metadata in a different
location than a wheel or a local checkout.</p>
<p>Having support for dynamic metadata also means that developers continue
to maintain elaborate and confusing systems.  For instance there is a
plugin for hatch that dynamically creates a readme <a class="footnote-reference" href="http://lucumr.pocoo.org/feed.atom#footnote-4" id="footnote-reference-4">[4]</a>, requiring even
arbitrary Python code to run to display documentation.  There are
plugins to automatically change versions to incorporate git version
hashes.  As a result to figure out what version you actually have
installed it's not just enough to look into a single file, you might
have to rely on a tool to tell you what's going on.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="moving-the-cheese">
<h2>Moving The Cheese</h2>
<p>The challenge with dynamic metadata in Python is vast, but unless you are
writing a resolver or packaging tool, you're not going to experience the
pain as much.  You might in fact quite enjoy the power of dynamic
metadata.  Unsurprisingly bringing up the <a class="reference external" href="https://discuss.python.org/t/brainstorming-eliminating-dynamic-metadata/71405">idea to remove it</a>
is very badly received.  There are so many workflows seemingly relying on it.</p>
<p>At this point fixing this problem might be really hard because it's a
social problem more than a technical one.  If the constraint would have
been placed there in the first place, these weird use cases would never
have emerged.  But because the constraints were not there, people were
free to go to town with leveraging it with all the consequences it causes.</p>
<p>I think at this point it's worth moving the cheese, but it's unclear if
this can be done through a standard.  Maybe the solution will be for tools
like <cite>uv</cite> or <cite>poetry</cite> to warn if dynamic metadata is used and strongly
discourage it.  Then over time the users of packages that use dynamic
metadata will start to urge the package authors to stop using it.</p>
<p>The cost of dynamic metadata is real, but it's felt only in small ways all
the time.  You notice it a bit when your resolver is slower than it has
to, you notice it if your packaging tool installs the wrong dependency,
you notice it if you need to read the manual for the first time when you
need to reconfigure your cache-key or force a package to constantly
reinstall, you notice it if you need to re-install your local dependencies
over and over for them not to break.  There are many ways you notice it.
You don't notice it as a roadblock, just as a tiny, tiny tax.  Except that
is a tax we all pay and it makes the user experience significantly worse
compared to what it could be.</p>
<p>The deeper lesson here is that if you give developers too much
flexibility, they will inevitably push the boundaries and that can have
significant downsides as we can see.  Because Python's packaging ecosystem
lacked constraints from the start, imposing them now has become a daunting
challenge.  Meanwhile, other ecosystems, like JavaScript's, took a more
structured approach early on, avoiding many of these pitfalls entirely.</p>

            <p>I&rsquo;ve just recently launched a self-paced introduction to Python that is <strong>extremely hands-on</strong>.
It&rsquo;s called <strong><a href="https://pym.dev/courses/jumpstart/overview">Python Jumpstart</a></strong> and it&rsquo;s based on introductory Python curriculum that I have been iterating on for years.</p>

<h2>Learn Python by writing Python code ✍</h2>

<p>We <em>do not</em> learn by putting information into the brain.
Our brains simply don&rsquo;t retain knowledge that way.</p>

<p>Learning happens from repeatedly attempting to retrieve information <em>from</em> the brain.
When it comes to Python, that means <strong>writing Python code</strong>.</p>

<p>So unlike most Python courses, Python Jumpstart is <em>not</em> focused on watching videos and rewriting code seen within videos.
Instead, this new Python course is based around <strong>learning Python by writing Python code</strong>.</p>

<h2>How Python Jumpstart is structured 🔬</h2>

<p>Python Jumpstart includes learning Python by solving <strong>46 short Python exercises</strong>.</p>

<p>Before each exercise, you&rsquo;ll watch a 5 minute video explaining a new Python topic.
You&rsquo;ll then attempt the exercise to put one or more Python topics into practice.</p>

<p>You won&rsquo;t solve many of the exercises on your first try and <em>that&rsquo;s okay</em>.
These exercises are designed to be revisited a few times over the course of weeks, until you&rsquo;re satisfied with your solution.</p>

<h2>This is not a sprint 📆</h2>

<p>This structured path to Python proficiency, includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Carefully crafted exercises that build real understanding</li>
<li>Short, detailed explanations that <em>won&rsquo;t</em> waste your time</li>
<li>A proven teaching approach that focuses on active learning</li>
<li>Spaced repetition to help concepts stick</li>
</ul>


<p>This is not a course for impatient or passive learners.
Learning takes <strong>repetitive effort</strong> spaced over many days and this course is structured to embrace that fact.</p>

<p>If you spend <strong>30 minutes</strong> on Python Jumpstart each day, I estimate that you&rsquo;ll complete this course in <strong>about 7 weeks</strong>.
You&rsquo;ll spend the large majority of that time writing Python code.</p>

<p>This course <em>will</em> take time, but it will be time well-spent.</p>

<h2>Launch week special: 50% off until December 2 ⏰</h2>

<p>Through Monday December 2, 2024, you can get lifetime access to <a href="https://pym.dev/courses/jumpstart/overview">Python Jumpstart</a> for <strong>$99</strong>.
After this launch week, Python Jumpstart will be <strong>$199</strong>.</p>

            <p><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-size: 11pt;">The PSF Board came together September 12th-15th, 2024, for our annual board retreat. This year we met in Lisbon, Portugal. We used the opportunity to work together in person to discuss high-level strategic planning for the future of the PSF. This year, we moved the retreat from January to September. We aimed to meet as a new board in person as soon as possible to build our trust and communication earlier- which has been working well!</span></p><p><span id="docs-internal-guid-b4d1675c-7fff-6dba-26f7-6130cea53874"></span></p><h2 dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-top: 18pt;"><span id="docs-internal-guid-b4d1675c-7fff-6dba-26f7-6130cea53874"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16pt; font-weight: 400; vertical-align: baseline;">Our retreat</span></span></h2><span id="docs-internal-guid-b4d1675c-7fff-6dba-26f7-6130cea53874"><br /><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;">After traveling in on 12th September, we shared a meal together and it was a great chance for some board members to meet our newly elected board member Cristián Maureira-Fredes. There was no “ice-breaking” needed– the ice already melted immediately (maybe due to the heat in Lisbon) that evening! We were sure that it would be a productive weekend going ahead.</span></p><br /><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;">In the following two days, the board sat together (except for a “walk and talk” session which we will explain in a bit) to go through all the topics on our agenda and lay down some strategies that the board will follow up in the coming year. On the first day before we jumped into strategies, we agreed on our values and behavioral norms for the meetings. We adopted a “jazz hands” gesture to show agreement and it turned out to be a very effective communication method.</span></p><br /><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;">We identified our relationships with various parts of the community and documented some of our long-term goals. We also identified our relationships with other entities and our grant program strategies (more on that later!).</span></p><br /><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;">On the second day, as we had been sitting down for most of the time during our meeting (there was no time to waste as the discussion was very intense), we got to do a “walk and talk” session. We broke into two groups to discuss some of the strategies regarding supporting PSF&nbsp; workgroups and mentoring future board members.</span></p><br /><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;">The last day was a travel day home, and everyone left Lisbon safely.

<p>This is a quick guide on how to turn SSH commands into a REST API service. The use-case may be remote administration
of devices or equipment that does not offer a REST interface or making sure that access to SSH commands is restricted
to selected external REST-based API clients only.</p>
<h2 id="python">Python</h2>
<p>The first thing needed is code of the service that will connect to SSH servers. Below is a service doing just that -
it receives name of the command to execute and host to run in on, translating stdout and stderr of SSH commands
into response documents which Zato in turn serializes to JSON.</p>

<h2 id="dashboard">Dashboard</h2>
<p>In the Zato Dashboard, let's go ahead and create an HTTP Basic Auth definition that a remote API client will authenticate against:</p>
<p><center>
<img src="https://upcdn.io/kW15bqq/raw/root/static/blog/images/3.2-ssh/basic-auth-menu.png" />
</center></p>
<p><img src="https://upcdn.io/kW15bqq/raw/root/static/blog/images/3.2-ssh/basic-auth-form.png" /></p>
<p>Now, the SSH service can be mounted on a newly created REST channel - note the security definition used and that data format is set to JSON.
We can skip all the other details such as caching or rate limiting, for illustration purposes, this is not needed.</p>
<p><img src="https://upcdn.io/kW15bqq/raw/root/static/blog/images/3.2-ssh/rest-menu.png" /></p>
<p><img src="https://upcdn.io/kW15bqq/raw/root/static/blog/images/3.2-ssh/rest-form.png" /></p>
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>At this point, everything is ready to use. We could make it accessible to external API clients but, for testing purposes,
let's simply invoke our SSH API gateway service from the command line:</p>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="line-1-1" name="line-1-1"></a><a href="#line-1-1"><span class="linenos"></span></a>$<span class="w"> </span>curl<span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;api:password@localhost:11223/api/ssh&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span>-d<span class="w"> </span><span class="se">\</span>
<a id="line-1-2" name="line-1-2"></a><a href="#line-1-2"><span class="linenos"></span></a><span class="w">    </span><span class="s1">'{&quot;host&quot;:&quot;localhost&quot;, &quot;command&quot;:&quot;uptime&quot;}'</span>
<a id="line-1-3" name="line-1-3"></a><a href="#line-1-3"><span class="linenos"></span></a><span class="o">{</span>
<a id="line-1-4" name="line-1-4"></a><a href="#line-1-4"><span class="linenos"></span></a><span class="w">    </span><span class="s2">&quot;is_ok&quot;</span>:<span class="w"> </span>true,
<a id="line-1-5" name="line-1-5"></a><a href="#line-1-5"><span class="linenos"></span></a><span class="w">    </span><span class="s2">&quot;cid&quot;</span>:<span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;27406f29c66c2ab6296bc0c0&quot;</span>,
<a id="line-1-6" name="line-1-6"></a><a href="#line-1-6"><span class="linenos"></span></a><span class="w">    </span><span class="s2">&quot;stdout&quot;</span>:<span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot; 09:45:42 up 37 min,  1 user,  load average: 0.14, 0.27, 0.18\n&quot;</span><span class="o">}</span>
<a id="line-1-7" name="line-1-7"></a><a href="#line-1-7"><span class="linenos"></span></a>$
</code></pre></div>
Note that, at this stage, the service should be used in trusted environments only, e.g. it will run any command that it is given
on input which means that in the next iteration it could be changed to only allow commands from an allow-list, rejecting
anything that is not recognized.</p>
<p>And this completes it - the service is deployed and made accessible via a REST channel that can be invoked using JSON.
Any command can be sent to any host and their output will be returned to API callers in JSON responses.</p>

<br /><img alt="Wing 10 Screen Shot" class="doc-image" src="https://wingware.com/images/screenshots/wing10-screenshot.png" /><br /><div class="section">
<h3 class="title-3">AI Assisted Development</h3>
<p>Wing Pro 10 takes advantage of recent advances in the capabilities of generative AI to
provide powerful AI assisted development, including AI code suggestion, AI driven code
refactoring, description-driven development, and AI chat. You can ask Wing to use AI to
(1) implement missing code at the current input position, (2) refactor, enhance, or extend
existing code by describing the changes that you want to make, (3) write new code from a
description of its functionality and design, or (4) chat in order to work through
understanding and making changes to code.</p>
<p>Examples of requests you can make include:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&quot;Add a docstring to this method&quot;
&quot;Create unit tests for class SearchEngine&quot;
&quot;Add a phone number field to the Person class&quot;
&quot;Clean up this code&quot;
&quot;Convert this into a Python generator&quot;
&quot;Create an RPC server that exposes all the public methods in class BuildingManager&quot;
&quot;Change this method to wait asynchronously for data and return the result with a callback&quot;
&quot;Rewrite this threaded code to instead run asynchronously&quot;
</pre>
<p>Yes, really!</p>
<p>Your role changes to one of directing an intelligent assistant capable of completing a
wide range of programming tasks in relatively short periods of time. Instead of typing out
code by hand every step of the way, you are essentially directing someone else to work
through the details of manageable steps in the software development process.</p>

            <p>This year it was hard to decide, and we wanted to also show who else got nominated, because they also deserve recognition, so it took a bit longer than we expected.</p>
<hr />
<p>The Django Software Foundation Board is pleased to announce that the 2024 Malcolm Tredinnick Memorial Prize has been awarded to <a href="https://www.rachellcalhoun.com/">Rachell Calhoun</a>.</p>

<p>Rachell advocates for others constantly through sponsorship, inclusivity, and connection. She is extremely empathic and seeks to not only welcome others in, but to actively bring them into the group.</p>
<p>She has been one of the core members of Djangonaut Space which has done a lot for bringing new contributors into the Django community. This program has done a lot to excite and energize the Django community and Rachell is one of the major reasons why. --<br />Throughout her career she's been involved in Django Girls starting about a decade ago in South Korea. She was a major organizer of the Grand Rapids, MI branch, before moving into the trustee role she occupies now.</p>
<p>Rachell is one of my favorite people and she's been doing an excellent job at growing Django and helping others feel more welcome here. Rachell is an excellent choice for the Malcolm Tredinnick 2024 award!</p>
<p>— Tim Shilling</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Rachell is an extremely skillful leader who is always nurturing newcomers into leaders. She has been pivotal to my experience with the Djangonaut Space Program.<br />I started out as a nervous Djangonaut who didn’t schedule my 1:1s until Rachell checked in with me and made sure I knew the program was a safe space to discuss anything.</p>
<p>When I joined the program organizers as a Navigator Coordinator, I was initially much more of a follower. Rachell knew to step back while continuing to provide her support, so I could step into the leadership role and get my job done.</p>

<p>Rachell shows people that she believes in them. She does this in a friendly, gentle, and encouraging manner. She never forces anyone to make decisions that they don’t feel comfortable with. The community is really lucky to have Rachell.</p>
<p>— Lilian</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Rachell Calhoun, one of the organizers and founders of Djangonaut Space, has been an open, supportive, and educational help on my Django journey. Her contributions to the Djangonaut Space program are invaluable—a program I hold quite dearly as a cornerstone of my technical interactions and growth.</p>

<p>Rachell's ideals of nurturing and guiding have shone through the program, for which I am grateful. Encouraging wonderful conversations, organizing and fostering mentorship, and being a great person!</p>

<p>I believe Rachell is an embodiment of the Malcolm Tredinnick spirit and am confident that should she win the prize, she would go on to create more impact for the Django community and the world at large.</p>
<p>— Emmanuel Katchy</p>

<h1>How do I pay the publisher of a web page?</h1>

<p>Here's an unanswered question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have money and I have a URL, how do I send money to the publisher of that URL?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>URLs tell you where to get content on the web, but they don't tell you
anything about how to support the person who created the content.
This story might sound similar to paying open source maintainers,
where a user can almost abstract an entire project to a single download URL.</p>

<p>There are tons of people creating content for the web and plenty of ways to get
paid (Patreon, Kofi, GitHub Sponsors, YouTube Paid Membership),
but there's no <em>standardized</em> way to direct someone interested in paying for
the content of a page in the right direction.</p>

<p>We have HTML meta headers for many things, including where to find an RSS feed
or what my Fediverse handle is, but none for enumerating options to pay the creator of the content.
I wish I could click a button to easily send a "tip" to someone who created something I enjoy
or to browse other options for supporting them.</p>

<h2>Existing technology</h2>

<h3><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Payment_Request_API">Payment Request API</a></h3>

<p>There are things like the web "Payment Request API" which gives you a JavaScript
API for generating a payment, but this doesn't fit my criteria.</p>

<p>For one: this means that every person creating content for the web needs to
add JavaScript to their page. This is a much higher bar than simply linking to existing payment methods
that a creator already likely uses to get paid. Being difficult means it's unlikely
for large numbers of people to do the work.</p>

<p>I also don't see being able to automate this because of the JavaScript.
Web creators likely have existing payment pages that they'd much rather link
out to instead of trying to handle payments themselves individually.</p>

<p>Lastly, this API exists and I don't see it being used by creators today.
That should say something about either its ease-of-use or return on investment
from potential supporters.</p>

<h3>Linking to payment methods in the page</h3>

<p>Yeah, we could scrape the payment URLs we know about embedded in the page. But
there's a difference between potential URLs in the page due to non-creator
generated content (links in comments, etc) and whatever the "authoritative"
URLs are for paying the creator of the page. Being able to set <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> tags
in <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> is typically a higher bar than setting arbitrary URLs in the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>.</p>

<h3>Podcasting 2.0 RSS <code>&lt;podcast:funding&gt;</code> tag</h3>

<p><a href="https://podcasting2.org/podcast-namespace/tags/funding">Podcasting 2.0</a> supports basically the exact tag that
I want to use which encodes a URL and  a human-readable name for that URL
into the metadata description of a podcast publication. Really great to see some prior art here.</p>

<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=42229968&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D42229930%2342229968">Thanks to DamonHD</a> for sending me this reference.</p>

<h3>Flattr</h3>

<p>Flattr is a service that tried to turn a "subscription" from users into micro-payouts
based on a users' browsing history. Flattr shut down in 2023. This approach isn't one I'm interested in replicating for
a few reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Access to the entire browsing history feels like a privacy nightmare.
Yes you receive a "complete" sample of which web pages a user has visited
but, yeah this doesn't seem great?</li>
<li>Flattr tried to create its own payment platform for creators, rather than
pushing users to send monetary support through existing stable payment methods
like Patreon. They had to do this because of the micro-payments thing.</li>
</ul>

<p>In general this is making me think micro-payments is extremely hard to do.
I think having a handful of dedicated fans for small creators might be enough
to "offset" the "loss" of micro-payments? Perhaps there can be a recommendation
to note to users when certain creators are "niche" and therefore are receiving
fewer payments relative to other creators and thus would benefit more from
a contribution / boost?</p>

<p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/quentin.pradet.me/post/3lbqj52tpes2p">Thanks to Quentin</a> for sending me this reference.</p>

<h3>Brave</h3>

<p>I know about Brave, and I would like to avoid crypto in my solution. Also many of the
creators I pay for don't use crypto but do have multiple payment methods. I don't think
the solution should require creators AND users adopt new technology to work.</p>

<h2>What happens now?</h2>

<p>I'm no stranger to standards, so maybe I do some research and
write a web standard proposal? Seems like fun! I'm imagining something like:</p>

<div class="codehilite">
<pre><span></span><code><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">head</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
    <span class="c">&lt;!-- ... --&gt;</span>
    <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">meta</span> <span class="na">property</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;financial-support&quot;</span> <span class="na">content</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;https://patreon.com/c/MatthewCarlson&quot;</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">head</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Because this is primarily for money, no doubt it will be abused to hell.
First-party browsers probably wouldn't do anything with this information
for the fear of legitimizing scammers' fake profiles.</p>

<p>The existence of the "Web Payments API" makes me think maybe it's not
a huge deal and that whenever money gets involved peoples' spidey-senses
start going off about whether a page is legitimate? Not sure.</p>

<p>Let me know what you think!</p>

            If you are a .NET developer or work in a place that has some of those folks, wouldn't it be great to fully leverage the entirety of PyPI with it's almost 600,000 packages inside your .NET code? But how would you do this? Previous efforts have let you write Python syntax but using the full libraries (especially the C-based ones) has been out of reach, until CSnakes. This project by Anthony Shaw and Aaron Powell unlocks some pretty serious integration between the two languages. We have them both here on the show today to tell us all about it.

<p><a href="http://sethmlarson.dev/feed#end-to-end-sbom-data-flow">TLDR: Skip intro, take me to the visualization!</a></p>

<p>I'm working on <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/sboms-for-python-packages-project/70261">improving measurability of Python packages</a> by allowing Software Bill-of-Materials documents (SBOM) to be included in Python packages so that projects and build tools can record information about a package for downstream use.</p>

<p>This is a cross-functional project where I need input from Python projects, Python packaging tools (build backends+tools and installers), but also from folks completely outside the Python community like SBOM tooling maintainers.
With projects like this, it can be difficult to "see the forest through the trees". When you're reviewing the packaging PEP, it can be difficult to imagine how or who is using the new standard. This article is to help visualize the end-to-end data flow.</p>

<h2>How SBOM data will be included in Python packages</h2>

<p>In short, the proposal is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Allow Python projects to manually specify SBOM documents
in <code>pyproject.toml</code> with <code>[project].sbom-files = ["..."]</code></li>
<li>Allow Python package archives to include self-describing
SBOM documents and reference them in metadata via <code>Sbom-File</code> field.</li>
<li>Zero-or-more SBOM documents per Python package archive.
Each tool adding SBOM data creates a new SBOM inside the archive to avoid conflicts.
End-user SBOM tools need to handle multiple SBOMs to "stitch" them together.</li>
</ul>

<h2>End-to-end SBOM data flow</h2>

<p>There are two Python packages being shown, <code>Package A</code> on the left and <code>Package B</code> on the right.
<code>Package A</code> depends on <code>Package B</code>. <code>Package A</code> is a pure-Python package with no bundled dependencies.
<code>Package B</code> uses binary extensions and uses auditwheel to bundle shared libraries.</p>

<br /><small><i>How SBOM data flows from Python package source code, build, to an SBOM generation tool</i></small>
</center>
</div>
<div class="col-6">
<p><strong>Stage 1:</strong> If the Python project bundles third-party software in their own source code then the project may specify one or more SBOM documents through <code>project.sbom-files</code> in <code>pyproject.toml</code>. Build backends copy these documents into source distributions and wheels.</p>
<p><strong>Stage 2:</strong> If the Python <code>build-backend</code> pulls dependencies (like Maturin and Cargo) while building a wheel those dependencies can be recorded in another SBOM document in the wheel.</p>
<p><strong>Stage 3:</strong> If a tool that modifies wheels by adding dependencies is used (like auditwheel) then that tool can record modifications in an SBOM document. At this point there are three separate SBOM documents included in the Package B archive.</p>
<p><strong>Stage 4:</strong> Archives are uploaded to an index like PyPI. The index can do some validation of included SBOM documents, if any.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p><strong>Stage 5:</strong> Installers download and install the Python package archives. The SBOM files are placed into the <code>.dist-info/sboms/</code> directory in the Python environment and referenced in package metadata.</p>

<p><strong>Stage 6:</strong> SBOM generation tools scan the Python environment and using existing Python package metadata and new SBOM documents with per-package data stitch together an Operational SBOM (OBOM) detailing the Python environment.</p>

<h2>Who does what?</h2>

<p>The plan is to allow each "actor" in the system adding SBOM data to a Python package
to create their own SBOM document inside the Python package.</p>

<p>This means they can choose any SBOM standard (although we'll recommend
sticking to a well-known one like CycloneDX and SPDX) and that intermediate tools won't need to "merge" SBOM data together.
Avoiding this merging is extremely important, because cross-standard SBOM data merges are a very hard problem. This problem is deferred to SBOM generation tools which <em>already</em> need to support multiple SBOM standards.</p>

<ul>
<li>Pure-Python projects that don't vendor software are easy, there's nothing to do here.</li>
<li>Python projects that vendor software can annotate that software using an SBOM and specify the SBOM in <code>pyproject.toml</code>.
Keeping this up-to-date is a non-zero amount of work, but I am hoping that by providing this PEP it will enable these types of contributions.
I'm also hoping to provide a lightweight pre-commit hook to help keeping these SBOM documents up-to-date, similar to what CPython already uses.</li>
<li>Python project which use a build backend that pull dependencies <em>should</em> be able to annotate what those dependencies are at build time.
There will be exceptions, looking into tools like Meson and multibuild to see what can be done.</li>
<li>Python bundling tools like auditwheel, delocate, etc can annotate shared libraries and DLLs that are pulled into wheels.</li>
</ul>

<p>My hope is that the most difficult part of this work (manually annotating a package if automatic tools can't)
will enable a new type of contribution from users of Python packages to provide SBOM data. Previously
there was no standardized method to have SBOM data propagate through Python packages, thus discouraged this
type of contribution.</p>

            <p>The DSF is once again partnering with JetBrains to run the <a href="https://jb.gg/asjljo">2024 Django Developers Survey</a> 🌈</p>
<p>Please take a moment to fill it out! It should only take about 10 minutes to complete. It’s an important metric of Django usage, and is immensely helpful to guide future technical and community decisions.</p>
<p><a class="cta" href="https://jb.gg/asjljo">Take the survey</a></p>
<p>The survey will be open until December 21st, 2024. After the survey is over, we will publish the aggregated results. JetBrains will also randomly choose 10 winners (from those who complete the survey in its entirety with meaningful answers), who will each receive a $100 Amazon Gift Card or a local equivalent.</p>
<h3 id="s-how-you-can-help">How you can help</h3>
<p>Once you’ve done the survey, take a moment to re-share on socials? And with your communities. The more diverse the answers, the better the results for all of us. Here are the relevant posts to boost:</p>

            <p>Today, we’re announcing early elections for the <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/teams/#steering-council-team">Django Software Foundation Steering Council</a> over the 6.x Django release cycle. Elected members will be on the Steering Council for two years, from the end of those elections in December, until April 2027 with the scheduled start of the Django 7.x release cycle.</p>
<h3 id="s-why-we-have-early-elections">Why we have early elections</h3>
<p>The DSF Board of Directors previously shared <a href="/weblog/2024/nov/14/technical-governance-challenges-and-opportunities/">Django’s technical governance challenges, and opportunities</a>. Now that the <a href="/weblog/2024/nov/17/2025-dsf-board-election-results/">Board elections are completed</a>, we’re ready to proceed with this other, separate election, following existing processes. We will want a Steering Council who strives  to meet the group’s intended goals:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>To safeguard big decisions that affect Django projects at a fundamental level.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To help shepherd the project’s future direction.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We expect the new Steering Council will take on those known challenges, resolve those questions of technical leadership, and update Django’s technical governance. They will have the full support of the Board of Directors to address this threat to Django’s future. And the Board will also be more decisive in intervening, should similar issues keep arising.</p>
<h3 id="s-elections-timeline">Elections timeline</h3>
<p>Here are the important dates of the Steering Council elections, subject to change:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>2024-11-21</strong>: announcement &amp; opening of voter registration</li>
