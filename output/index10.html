            <p>What can you as a software developer do to fight climate change?
My first and primary answer is <a href="https://pythonspeed.com/articles/climate-change/">getting involved with local politics</a>.
However, if you write software that operates at sufficient scale, you can also reduce carbon emissions by making your software faster.</p>

<p>In this article we’ll cover:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Why more computation uses more electricity.</li>
  <li>Why you probably don’t need to think about this most of the time.</li>
  <li>Reducing emissions by reducing compute time.</li>
  <li>Reducing emissions with parallelism (even with the same amount of compute time!).</li>
  <li>Some alternative scenarios and caveats: embodied emissions and Jevons Paradox.</li>
</ul>

            <p>Compared to <a href="https://rickardlindberg.me/2024/11/03/newsletter-october-primitive.html">last
month</a>,
this month I did some programming in my spare time. I had fewer commitments,
and my mind started thinking about various programming projects. We also got
the first snowfall of the season and I got to enjoy a run in it:</p>
<p><img alt="Me running in a snow-covered landscape with the
sun setting in the background." height="337" src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/173380/2024/running-nov23.jpg" width="600" /></p>
<h2 id="a-new-code-editor">A New Code Editor</h2>
<p>The programming project that I started working on is code editor that is a mix
of a text editor and a structured editor. It is all text, but parsers and
pretty printers allow you to work with a tree structure and not think too much
about syntax. The code is available on
<a href="https://github.com/rickardlindberg/rleditor">GitHub</a>, and here is what it
looks like when editing a JSON document:</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of rledit editing a JSON document with a
selection." height="333" src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/173380/2024/rledit-nov28.png" width="478" /></p>
<p>I got the idea for this project when trying out
<a href="https://pypi.org/project/black/">Black</a>. Black automatically formats Python
code for you so that you don&rsquo;t have to think about it. I&rsquo;ve been interested in
structured editors for some time, but my feeling is that they are not user
friendly because they limit what you can type. Then I came up with this idea of
an editor that constantly parses what you type. If the parse is successful, it
pretty prints it for you and provides you with edit operations on the AST. But
it is all still just text, so you can type whatever. In the worst case, the
parse fails and you have to fix it manually.</p>
<p>So far, it looks quite promising. And most importantly, I&rsquo;m having fun
experimenting. The most likely scenario is that the project will not be a
success, but I will learn something and have fun doing so. But you never know.
One day, one of these projects just might turn into something that is
invaluable.</p>
<h2 id="tdd">TDD</h2>
<p>This month I also watched a presentation by Kent Beck called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/C5IH0ABmyc0">TDD: Theme &amp;
Variations</a>. For me, it was a nice
refresher on the origins of TDD.</p>
<p>One thing that I appreciate with TDD, that I partially had forgotten, is how it
reduces anxiety. Kent reminded me of it in the presentation. When all tests are
passing and you can&rsquo;t think of any more tests to write, you are done, and you
know that it works. That reduces anxiety a lot.</p>

            <p>Publishing Python packages used to be a daunting task, but not any more. Even better, it has become significantly more secure. Gone are the days of juggling usernames, passwords, or API tokens while relying on <a href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/distributing-packages-using-setuptools/#uploading-your-project-to-pypi" rel="noopener noreferrer">CLI tools</a>. With trusted publishing, you simply provide PyPI with the details of your GitHub repository, and GitHub Actions takes care of the heavy lifting.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  How to Publish Your Python Package with Trusted Publishing

<p>I will introduce a workflow that will publish your package to TestPyPi when a tag is created (on the <code>development</code> branch), or to PyPi when you merge to the <code>main</code> branch.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Prepare Your Package for Publishing
</h3>

<p>Ensure your Python package follows PyPI’s packaging guidelines. At a minimum, you’ll need:</p>

<li>A <a href="https://dev.to/ldrscke/hypermodernize-your-python-package-3d9m"><del>setup.py or</del> pyproject.toml</a> file defining your package metadata.</li>
<li>Properly structured code with a clear directory layout.</li>
<li>A README file to showcase your project on PyPI.</li>
</ul>

<p>For a detailed checklist, refer to the <a href="https://packaging.python.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Python Packaging User Guide</a>.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Configure GitHub Actions in Your Repository
</h3>

<p>Let's start by creating a new GitHub action <code>.github/workflows/test-build-publish.yml</code>.<br />
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight yaml"><code><span class="na">name</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">test-build-publish</span>

<span class="na">on</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="pi">[</span><span class="nv">push</span><span class="pi">,</span> <span class="nv">pull_request</span><span class="pi">]</span>

<span class="na">permissions</span><span class="pi">:</span>
  <span class="na">contents</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">read</span>

<span class="na">jobs</span><span class="pi">:</span>

  <span class="na">build-and-check-package</span><span class="pi">:</span>
    <span class="na">name</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">Build &amp; inspect our package.</span>
    <span class="na">runs-on</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">ubuntu-latest</span>

      <span class="pi">-</span> <span class="na">uses</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">actions/checkout@v4</span>
      <span class="pi">-</span> <span class="na">uses</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">hynek/build-and-inspect-python-package@v2</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>This <a href="https://github.com/hynek/build-and-inspect-python-package" rel="noopener noreferrer">action</a> will build your package and uploads the built wheel and the source distribution (<code>SDist</code>) as GitHub Actions artefacts.</p>

<p>Next, we add a step to publish to <a href="https://test.pypi.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">TestPyPI</a>. This step will run whenever a tag is created, ensuring that the build from the previous step has completed successfully. Replace PROJECT_OWNER and PROJECT_NAME with the appropriate values for your repository.<br />
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight yaml"><code>  <span class="na">test-publish</span><span class="pi">:</span>
    <span class="na">if</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="pi">&gt;-</span>

          <span class="na">repository-url</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">https://test.pypi.org/legacy/</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>This step downloads the artefacts created during the build process and uploads them to TestPyPI for testing.</p>

<p>In the last step, we will upload the package to PyPI when a pull request is merged into the <code>main</code> branch.<br />

<h3>
  
  
  Configure GitHub Environments
</h3>

<p>To ensure that only specific tags trigger the publishing workflow and maintain control over your release process.<br />
Create a new environment <code>test-release</code> by navigating to Settings -&gt; Environments in your GitHub repository.</p>

<p>Set up the environment and add a deployment tag rule.</p>

<p><a class="article-body-image-wrapper" href="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fze4cijlsqrnl8vul34b0.png"><img alt="Add a new environment" height="357" src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fze4cijlsqrnl8vul34b0.png" width="800" /></a></p>

<p><a class="article-body-image-wrapper" href="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fc4zyewqobkjrjnliqypm.png"><img alt="Create test environment" height="377" src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fc4zyewqobkjrjnliqypm.png" width="800" /></a></p>

<p>Limit which branches and tags can deploy to this environment based on rules or naming patterns.</p>

<p>Configure the target tags.</p>

<p><a class="article-body-image-wrapper" href="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fokfurlryb8oy0f6bx2go.png"><img alt="Configure target tags" height="291" src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fokfurlryb8oy0f6bx2go.png" width="640" /></a></p>

<p>The pattern <code>[0-9]*.[0-9]*.[0-9]*</code> matches semantic versioning tags such as <code>1.2.3</code>, <code>0.1.0</code>, or <code>2.5.1b3</code>, but it excludes arbitrary tags like <code>bugfix-567</code> or <code>feature-update</code>.</p>

<p>Repeat this for the <code>release</code> environment to protect the <code>main</code> branch in the same way, but this time targeting the <code>main</code> branch.</p>

<p><a class="article-body-image-wrapper" href="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fx0795ks0roh3a4l1u351.png"><img alt="Configure target branch" height="299" src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fx0795ks0roh3a4l1u351.png" width="626" /></a></p>

<h3>
  
  
  Set Up a PyPI Project and Link Your GitHub Repository
</h3>

<p>Create an account on <a href="https://test.pypi.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">TestPyPI</a> if you don’t have one.<br />
Navigate to your account, <a href="https://test.pypi.org/manage/account/publishing/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Publishing</a> and add a new pending publisher.<br />
Link your GitHub repository to the PyPI project by providing its name, your GitHub username, the repository name, the workflow name (<code>test-build-publish.yml</code>) and the environment name (<code>test-release</code>).</p>

<p><a class="article-body-image-wrapper" href="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fckh3r49j6tb2mdieszoo.png"><img alt="Configure PyPI trusted publisher" height="857" src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fckh3r49j6tb2mdieszoo.png" width="579" /></a></p>

<p>Repeat the above on <a href="https://pypi.org/manage/account/publishing/" rel="noopener noreferrer">PyPI</a> with the environment name set to <code>release</code>.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Test the Workflow
</h3>

<p>Now whenever you create a tag on your development branch, it will trigger a release to be uploaded to TestPyPI and merging the development branch into main will upload a release to PyPI.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  What Wasn't Covered
</h2>

<p>While this guide provides an introduction to trusted publishing workflows, there are additional steps and best practices you might consider implementing. For example, setting up <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/managing-a-branch-protection-rule" rel="noopener noreferrer">branch protection rules</a> can ensure only authorized collaborators can push tags or merge to protected branches, like <code>main</code> or <code>develop</code>. You can also enforce status checks or require pull request reviews before merging, adding another layer of quality assurance. </p>

<p>Have a look at my <a href="https://github.com/cleder/python-repository-template" rel="noopener noreferrer">python-repository-template</a> that covers additional enhancement to this workflow, such as requiring unit and static tests to pass, checking the package with <a href="https://github.com/regebro/pyroma" rel="noopener noreferrer">pyroma</a> and ensuring that your tag matches the version of your package with <a href="https://github.com/cleder/vercheck" rel="noopener noreferrer">vercheck</a>.</p>

            Sentiment analysis is a powerful tool for understanding emotions in text. While there are many ways to approach sentiment analysis, including more traditional lexicon-based and machine learning approaches, today we’ll be focusing on one of the most cutting-edge ways of working with text – large language models (LLMs). We’ll explain how you can use these [&#8230;]

            <p>Another big release day! Python 3.13.1 and 3.12.8
 were regularly scheduled releases, but they do contain a few security 
fixes. That makes it a nice time to release the security-fix-only 
versions too, so everything is as secure as we can make it.</p><div class="cooked">

<p>Python 3.13’s first maintenance release. My child is all growed up 
now, I guess! Almost 400 bugfixes, build improvements and documentation 
changes went in since 3.13.0, making this the very best Python release 
to date.</p><p><a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3131/">https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3131/</a></p><h1 style="text-align: left;">Python 3.12.8</h1>
<p>Python 3.12 might be slowly reaching middle age, but still received 
over 250 bugfixes, build improvements and documentation changes since 
3.12.7.</p>

<p>I know it’s probably hard to hear, but this is the <em>second</em>

know, but it’s true! Only 11 commits went in since 3.11.10.</p>

<p>Python 3.10 received a total of 14 commits since 3.10.15. Why more 
than 3.11? Because it needed a little bit of extra attention to keep 
working with current GitHub practices, I guess.</p>

<p>Python 3.9 isn’t quite ready for pasture yet, as it’s set to receive 
security fixes for at least another 10 months. Very similarly to 3.10, 
it received 14 commits since 3.9.20.</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.basedpyright.com">Basedpyright</a>  is a fork of pyright with
various type checking improvements, improved vscode support and pylance
features built into the language server. It has a <a href="https://docs.basedpyright.com/latest/benefits-over-pyright/new-diagnostic-rules/">list</a> of benefits over Pyright.</p>
<p>In case you want to use that inside of <a href="https://neovim.io">neovim</a> using
<a href="https://github.com/williamboman/mason.nvim">Mason</a>, you will have to remember
to have the configuration inside of a <code>settings</code> key. The following is from my
setup.</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">basedpyright = {
  settings = {
    basedpyright = {
      analysis = {
        diagnosticMode = 'openFilesOnly',
        typeCheckingMode = 'basic',
        capabilities = capabilities,
        useLibraryCodeForTypes = true,
        diagnosticSeverityOverrides = {
          autoSearchPaths = true,
          enableTypeIgnoreComments = false,
          reportGeneralTypeIssues = 'none',
          reportArgumentType = 'none',

          reportAssignmentType = 'none',
        },
      },
    },

<p>Struggled for a few hours to fix this couple of days ago.</p>

            In this video course, you'll learn about two popular coding styles in Python: Look Before You Leap (LBYL) and Easier to Ask Forgiveness than Permission (EAFP). You can use these styles to deal with errors and exceptional situations in your code. You'll dive into the discussion on LBYL vs EAFP in Python.

            There has been a lot of changes in the low-level Python space these days. The biggest has to be how many projects have rewritten core performance-intensive sections in Rust. Or even the wholesale adoption of Rust for newer projects such as uv and ruff. On this episode, we dive into the tools and workflow needed to build these portions of Python apps in Rust with David Seddon and Samuel Colvin.

<p>During the last month we focused on fixing bugs, improving the behaviour of things, speeding-up performance issues - building on the changes from <a href="https://discuss.tryton.org/t/tryton-release-7-4/">our last Tryton Release 7.4</a>. We also added some new features which we would like to introduce to you in this newsletter.</p>
<p>For an in depth overview of the <a href="https://bugs.tryton.org/">Tryton issues please take a look at our issue tracker </a> or see the issues and merge requests <a href="https://code.tryton.org/tryton/-/labels">filtered by label</a>.</p>
<h2 id="heading--user">Changes for the User</h2>
<h3 id="heading--accounting">Accounting, Invoicing and Payments</h3>
<p>Now <a href="https://bugs.tryton.org/8876">we compute the maturity date of grouped account move lines per debit/credit</a>.</p>
<h2 id="heading--new-releases">New Releases</h2>
<p>We released bug fixes for the currently maintained <a href="https://discuss.tryton.org/t/release-process/395">long term support series</a><br />
<a href="https://code.tryton.org/tryton/-/commits/branch/7.0">7.0</a> and <a href="https://code.tryton.org/tryton/-/commits/branch/6.0">6.0</a>, and for the penultimate series <a href="https://code.tryton.org/tryton/-/commits/branch/7.4">7.4</a> and <a href="https://code.tryton.org/tryton/-/commits/branch/7.2">7.2</a>.</p>
<h2 id="heading--translators">Changes for the Translators</h2>
<p><a href="https://foss.heptapod.net/tryton/tryton/-/merge_requests/1862">Now we support plural translations for <code>report</code> and <code>ir.message</code></a>. The other translatable strings are <code>labels</code> that have no <em>count</em>. The plural rule is a Python expression which returns an integer following the gettext design. For the report, it is possible to use the <a href="https://genshi.edgewall.org/wiki/Documentation/0.6.x/i18n.html#messages">Genshi <code>i18n:choose</code>, <code>i18n:singular</code>, <code>i18n:plural</code></a> and for OpenDocument the <code>gettext</code> and <code>ngettext</code> methods are added to the evaluation context.</p>
<h2 id="heading--sysadmin">Changes for the System Administrator</h2>
<p>Now we can <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html#context-objects">set the decimal precision</a> of default context <a href="https://foss.heptapod.net/tryton/tryton/-/issues/13572">from the environment variable <code>TRYTOND_DECIMAL_PREC</code></a>.</p>
<h2 id="heading--developer">Changes for Implementers and Developers</h2>
<p>To provide better feedback to the user, now we also <a href="https://code.tryton.org/tryton/-/commit/4f0bb0ae3bfa129ed1f203f4533fccbd22d2c470">add equivalent domains of SQL constraints</a>.</p>
<p>Now we <a href="https://code.tryton.org/tryton/-/commit/a51b97e18a760c9de86f2988db32fac1ad76524c">extract the timesheet cost computation</a> from the <code>_get_cost</code> method to allow customization e.g. to use a different composition of the costs.<br />
Also we <a href="https://code.tryton.org/tryton/-/commit/7c7f60798d49748d586b197a84a6ab09deec63a1">round the work total with currency digits in <code>get_total</code> method</a> now, to allow extending the computation methods, without rounding too early.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://docs.tryton.org/7.0/server/ref/models.html#trytond.model.Model">trytond.model.Model</a> is defined by a python class:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-python">
    from trytond.model import ModelSQL, fields

    class Party(ModelSQL):
        """Party"""
        __name__ = 'party.party'
</code></pre>
<p>It was needed to define three different <em>identifiers</em>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Python <code>class</code> name: Party</li>
<li>class doc-string: Party</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.tryton.org/latest/server/ref/models.html#trytond.model.Model.__name__"><code>trytond.model.Model.__name__</code></a>: party.party</li>
</ol>
<p>The translated text string of the model which is shown in the user interface was extracted from the <code>__doc__</code> (doc-string) of the <code>class</code> definition.</p>
<p>Now we replaced the class doc-string extraction by parsing the <code>trytond.model.Model.__name__</code> attribute and <a href="https://code.tryton.org/tryton/-/blob/branch/default/trytond/trytond/tests/test_model.py#L393">try to make it human readable</a>.  Changing an existing  <code>__name__</code> attribute usually implies a database migration.<br />
To work-around existing not so useful <code>__name__</code> values <a href="https://docs.tryton.org/latest/server/ref/models.html#trytond.model.Model.__string__">we introduced the new class attribute <code>trytond.model.Model.__string__</code></a> which let you define the model string directly.</p>
<p>We also take the chance and clean-up the name-space by renaming</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://code.tryton.org/tryton/-/commit/de19952c097a0c2fb4bc6c629d33e2186d5c6ff4"><code>ir.model.name</code> field into <code>ir.model.string</code></a>,</li>
<li><a href="https://code.tryton.org/tryton/-/commit/a4f347999b8378ed8c8eaf0716bd30262ced745d"><code>ir.model.model</code> field into <code>ir.model.name</code></a> and</li>
<li><a href="https://code.tryton.org/tryton/-/commit/e046a00333e36a4bfeed2cf3b18155bd2755cbe5"><code>ir.model.field.field_description</code> into <code>ir.model.field.string</code></a></li>
</ul>
<p>Finally <a href="https://code.tryton.org/tryton/-/commit/23ce421d3bb95d782156718de37b5c31fb68cb48">we removed most of the former doc-strings from all the classes</a>, only in some <a href="https://foss.heptapod.net/tryton/tryton/-/blob/branch/default/trytond/trytond/ir/lang.py#L71">rare cases we add the <code>__string__</code> attribute</a>.</p>

            <p>Do you like Python? Do you like games? Are you a fan of autonomously controlled tanks? Then <a href="https://github.com/mjs/pybot-arena">PyBot Arena</a> might be just the thing for you!</p>
<p>PyBot Arena is a game engine where participants implement algorithms - in Python of course - for controlling tanks which are then pitted against each other. I created the game for the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/NZPUG-Christchurch/">Python NZ Christchurch meetup</a> as a fun way to end the year, with creative and hilarious results.</p>
<a href="https://github.com/mjs/pybot-arena">
<img src="/images/pybot-arena.png" style="display: block; margin: auto; width: 80%;" />
</a>
<p>Instructions for running the game and creating your own bots are in the <a href="https://github.com/mjs/pybot-arena/blob/master/README.md">README</a>. The various bots created by the folks at the meetup are <a href="https://github.com/mjs/pybot-arena/tree/master/bots">checked in</a> to the <a href="https://github.com/mjs/pybot-arena">repository</a> for your inspiration and enjoyment.</p>
<p>Please <a href="mailto:hello@menno.io">let me know</a> if you create your own bots or use the game at a meetups. I'd love to see what people come up with.</p>
<p>There's also plenty of ways the game engine could be improved. I've documented some of them <a href="https://github.com/mjs/pybot-arena/issues">as issues</a> on GitHub. Contributions are very welcome.</p>
<p>Many thanks to the author of the <a href="https://github.com/PaulleDemon/Hunter2">Hunter2</a> game on GitHub. This was the starting point for PyBot Arena.</p>

<p>2 Weeks ago I was down with fever, but as I became better after a few days I managed to attend <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International's</a> Stockholm chapter's event on activism. I had to travel to a different part of Stockholm, which was fun.</p>
<p>The day started with welcome talk and then a new &quot;Palestine Activist Group&quot;
presented their work (in both English and Swedish). Then the main opening talk (in Swedish)
from a very senior Swedish journalist about history and important dates related
to Palestine. I managed to understand 50-60% of the words. Still a lot of learn.</p>
<p>During the break I had longer chats about privacy, data and our lives. It was
good to find folks who knows/uses Python/Fedora/Debian/Ubuntu and other Open
Source tools in their daily lives, sometimes even without knowing.</p>
<p>After the morning break, I attended a workshop about being an activist. It was
filled with discussions, and of course a lot of new words in Swedish for me.
But, the delivery of the workshop was good, people talked about what they think
about being an individual activist and things to consider etc.</p>
<p>Next day I had a workshop for a selected group, about boycotting large services
and how to providing least amount data to preserve our privacy. The group
consisted people from various parts of Swedish society, people working in other
government agencies and large multinational companies.</p>
<p>We talked about metadata and phones provide both metadata and real data to the
various services via apps. Explaining people to imagine that every time they
get out of home, there are many humans walking with them to every destination,
keeping notes of every place visit, and every chats they are having with
another person or about groups, and then later selling that information to
other businesses. It is one thing to talk about these, but it is complete
opposite to show. So, I showed them live how much our phones/computers talk. I
had my old Pixel4a configured with <a href="https://grapheneos.org">GrapheneOS</a>, and
one of the participant connected their regular Pixel phone to the same VPN. And
people seemed to be offended by seeing the amount of data flowing, even when
the phone is not use. The below is a screenshot I took today morning from the
same demo setup.</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot of the DNS calls" src="https://kushaldas.in/images/dns_calls_phones.png" /></p>
<p>We also talked about various chatting platforms, I already built another system
to teach kids about how various social chatting platforms work. It was a
perfect tool for this demo. We discussed about various other technologies in
our daily lives and how they affect privacy.</p>
