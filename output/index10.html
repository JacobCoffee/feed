            <p>“Does it make sense to move to the next phase of <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0703/">PEP 703</a>?”, core developer Matt Page opened his presentation to the Language Summit. Free-Threaded Python has come far since the last Language Summit, where <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/06/python-language-summit-2024-free-threading-ecosystems.html">Daniele Parmeggiani presented on free-threaded Python</a> using the then-newly-added “<span style="font-family: courier;">--disable-gil</span>” option.</p><p>Matt had prepared a status report for free-threaded Python on all of the axes that PEP 703’s acceptance had laid out: Performance, Stability, Maintainability, and Adoption, and wanted to ask core developers when the PEP should proceed to the next stages.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Performance</h2><p>The performance gap for free-threaded and non-free-threaded Python was 40% in Python 3.13. This has been reduced to less than 10% for most platforms, and the gap is platform-dependent. For macOS, there is not much difference, but for Ubuntu and Windows, the gap is around 7-8% slower for single-threaded workloads. Matt stressed that these values are “point-in-time” and that the team will keep working on them, but “will eventually reach a point of diminishing returns”.</p><p>Matt added that the memory overhead was more substantial at 20% more for pyperformance workloads compared to without free-threading, but that the team “was just starting to work on this”. Matt suspected that the memory overhead was “mostly fixed” and thus “would be a smaller percentage overhead in real workloads”.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Stability</h2><p>Matt shared that the architectural changes for free-threaded Python had all been completed and that none of the reported issues “required any large architecture changes”. “[Sam’s] design has proven to be sound, which is great for the future”. The issues that are reported are not disproportionate compared to bugs reported about the rest of the CPython project, and “around half of the issues are data races reported by [ThreadSanitizer], which are easier to fix”.</p><p>The remaining work is creating a Stable ABI for free-threading and continuing to fix thread-safety issues with standard library modules. The most popular areas of Python, like dictionaries and lists, are already thread-safe, but the team still has to “work through the long-tail” of APIs.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Maintainability</h2><p>Matt acknowledged that free-threaded Python was a step-function of complexity and asked, “Can core developers support this complexity?” Matt noted that the set of contributors to free-threaded Python architecture was small but growing. Luckily, “the complexity is well-contained. Most people won’t need to touch free-threaded code and most core developers will only interact with critical sections which are well-documented”. Matt shared that there is “comprehensive documentation” for both core developers and users looking to parallelize workloads.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Adoption</h2><p>Quansight Labs has <a href="https://py-free-threading.github.io/tracking/">created a resource page</a> available for users trying out free-threaded Python or migrating their code and extension modules to support free-threaded Python. There’s also a <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/free-threaded-python-community-discord/88571">Discord channel</a> and <a href="https://discuss.python.org/c/threading/38">Threading category on the Python Discourse</a> for users looking for help. The resource page also hosts a <a href="https://py-free-threading.github.io/tracking/">free-threading compatibility status for important Python packages and tools</a>.</p><p>Matt also shared another <a href="https://hugovk.github.io/free-threaded-wheels/">compatibility status tracker</a> created by Hugo van Kemenade that automatically updates based on the availability of free-threaded wheels (wheels with an ABI tag that ends in “t” like “cp13t”) for popular Python packages with extension modules. The current status was around ⅙ of the top 360 projects on PyPI, with extension modules supporting free-threading, notably popular scientific packages like numpy, pandas, and scipy.</p><p>Matt also recommended anyone interested in more about community adoption to watch Lysandros Nikolaou and Nathan Goldbaum’s talk at PyCon US titled “<a href="https://us.pycon.org/2025/schedule/presentation/42/">Unraveling Community Support for Free-Threaded Python</a>”. The recording is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuU3ksI1l04">now available on YouTube</a>.</p><p>Matt asked for a few outcomes from the free-threading discussions at the Language Summit. Firstly, Matt hoped that core developers might start thinking about free-threading from the beginning when designing and developing new language features. He followed up with a suggestion to focus on performance and correctness when free-threading is enabled.</p><p>Secondly, Matt was hoping to receive a signal for the community that free-threading was not going to disappear suddenly. “We need to see more people using [free-threading] to find the next set of bugs and to test the implementation”, Matt continued, “and if [free-threading] has an air of experimentality, it’s harder to justify adopting [free-threading]”.</p><p>The current status of PEP 703 is that free-threading has been conditionally accepted by the Steering Council, and that the ability to back out all free-threading code from CPython is reserved by the Steering Council in case there are problems with the implementation. That status hasn’t materially changed since the PEP’s conditional acceptance.</p><p>Matt concluded his presentation by asking whether the Steering Council and core developers had thoughts or concerns on proceeding to the next stage of PEP 703 and free-threading.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Discussion</h2><p>Core developer Eric Smith asked whether removing the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) would cause a “permanent mental overhead for core developers” and asked how often other core developers made a change in Python that broke free-threading. Matt shared that this situation was “pretty rare so far,” especially beyond ThreadSanitizer failures.</p><p>“At the C-layer, you already had to think about the GIL potentially getting released”, commented Thomas Wouters, “...cases that were protected by the GIL before PEP 703 can now easily be protected by critical sections”. Thomas added, “There are cases where you need to think about [free-threading], but for the most part it’s not that big of a deal” and “The tools from PEP 703 make it not hard to write correct code, even under free-threading”.</p><p>Brandt Bucher pushed back on Thomas’s comments that the interpreter already had to worry about reentrant code, saying that free-threading is another flavor and that there definitely is “mental overhead” and an “ongoing concern and constant friction”. Especially in previously straightforward cases like getting an item from a list.</p><p>Brandt asked whether 16% of PyPI packages supporting free-threading was enough to say that free-threading couldn’t become a “rugpull” situation, and if not, “what number would the Steering Council be comfortable with?” Brandt also identified that not only the availability of free-threaded wheels, but also their usage through downloads should be examined, to see whether free-threading was being used in the real world.</p><p>Brandt also commented on unmaintained packages with extensions that “would never be thread-safe”. Brandt asked whether the plan was to keep the functionality that falls back to using the GIL when a module isn’t marked as free-threading safe. Sam Gross confirmed that “[he] didn’t see any reason to remove the optional GIL”, even when free-threading became the default.</p><p>When asked about thread-safe containers and data structures for users, Matt answered that “they wanted to provide thread-safe data structures”, but that it “hasn’t been a focus right now” and that the work would likely start as a package on PyPI before moving to the standard library after “getting the abstractions right”.</p><p>Gregory Smith, introducing himself as a “token” Steering Council member, said he wanted to “listen to what other [core developers] are saying at the Language Summit and PyCon US” and to get a “vibe check” about how free-threading is going. Greg shared that the Steering Council was “waiting for the end of PyCon US to give an update on [PEP 703]” and that the current status is a bit of a “chicken and egg” situation between the experimental labeling and whether users can expect free-threading in the future to drive more adoption.</p><p>Thomas provided his perspective that “maintainability” was the biggest question in his mind. The number of projects going on, JIT, faster CPython, free-threading, general interpreter development, that it is “probably inevitable there’ll be times with proposed changes that these projects will be brought into conflict”. Thomas highlighted the need for a way to resolve the tradeoffs, like performance versus stable free-threading, and that “as a community, we need to own the shared responsibility that the entire ecosystem works”.</p><p>Pablo Galindo Salgado, who is also a Steering Council member, was concerned that we were seeing the “easy part” of free-threading adoption. “Numpy and the interpreter are receiving lots of support from people who know what they’re doing”. Pablo was curious how the work to adopt free-threading in other extensions would proceed without this expertise and resourcing. Pablo didn’t think this was a blocker for free-threading, but “made him less enthusiastic about the message to ‘just do it’” and would like to avoid a situation where a decision is made but then the “long-tail of adoption takes forever because we didn’t understand how to drive [adoption]”.</p><p>Thomas agreed that more documentation was needed on how to debug issues like ThreadSanitizer, to set expectations for users and library maintainers, and to build tools for thread-safety for libraries and users. Thomas felt confident that this would get done and that “the work isn’t unknown work, we know what we need to do”.</p><p>“I think we’re on that precipice of scientific Python really embracing more of the free-threading” said Carol Willing, recalling the infamous Python 2 to 3 transition for scientific Python projects “which was the initial driver for greater adoption of Python 3”. Carol hoped that there would be a huge push this year on free-threading and building on the awareness and the documentation: “I was always skeptical of whether we would get the social things in-place, and I think we are and we’re doing it well.”</p><div><br /></div>

            <p>Tobias Wrigstad, Matthew Parkinson, and Fridtjof Stoldt attended their first Python Language Summit to talk about some new concurrency concepts with core developers. Their slides have great diagrams, so I recommend checking them out. Tobias delivered the presentation to core developers, opening with a “potentially contentious statement” that “[data races and concurrency bugs] were the future that free-threaded Python programmers would see if free-threading was adopted for Python programs”.</p><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi-gHIfPZi4EIA1RJnTrUOrDkWemTs9Vdb0dwGUoC90Ty4DO9iSDb_WX38A8LDg_9_D_pDRMMNKyuSmNfB3ERBG5yzwjHboTUQnmBtWmuul0kfXytagG8ManMR3l2O8ZeJcMvUtS-UghM_Jd-D6nM0LUhne4vg4Z5RDmkGxqw8kDRrPw2SaVQ/s1279/Screenshot%20from%202025-06-04%2008-54-46.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi-gHIfPZi4EIA1RJnTrUOrDkWemTs9Vdb0dwGUoC90Ty4DO9iSDb_WX38A8LDg_9_D_pDRMMNKyuSmNfB3ERBG5yzwjHboTUQnmBtWmuul0kfXytagG8ManMR3l2O8ZeJcMvUtS-UghM_Jd-D6nM0LUhne4vg4Z5RDmkGxqw8kDRrPw2SaVQ/s320/Screenshot%20from%202025-06-04%2008-54-46.png" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">“Off to the data races!”</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The issue is when a value, such as “A” in the above diagram, is shared across multiple threads and written concurrently. “There is no easy way to tell when an object is shared. In the worst case, you have to read the whole program”.</p><p>These data-race bugs are also difficult to resolve using existing tools like “ChatGPT or StackOverflow,” which are only able to solve “syntax-driven problems,” and only after drawing the object graph do we see problems. Tools like ThreadSanitizer (TSan) can help, “but you first need to understand that you need to use a tool”. “As a Python programmer, I’m assuming this is not in your typical toolchain”.</p><p>Tobias continued, “The PEP 703 work has shown that it’s costly for the runtime to protect itself against racing code. Can we lift this problem up and talk about this problem at the Python level and make Python data-race free? Can we get an exception instead of a race?”</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Deep Immutability</h2><p>Referencing the “freezing” proposal that Mark Shannon had spoken about just hours ago in his Language Summit talk “An Uncontentious Talk about Contention”, “deep immutability” is one option for resolving data races in Python. Some performance improvements could be gained by adopting this model.</p><p>This model makes “all shared data immutable” so “there can be no data races” and is “trivial to check at runtime”. However, to do so would require sacrificing mutability, which is “common in Python programs”. “More immutability is great, but it’s not a solution to all our problems.”</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Rust’s ownership model</h2><p>“If we squint a little bit, we can explain Rust’s ownership model as ‘objects with a reference count greater than 1 cannot be mutated’”, Tobias explained. Rust’s ownership model allows for mutable objects as long as an object isn’t referenced more than once.</p><p>Adopting Rust’s model would require a “move operator” which, when used, “torches the original reference” and moves the reference to a new owner. This operator provides a safe transfer of mutable objects when a reference count is exactly 1.</p><p>However, “the same rule that prevents Y being assigned to X prevents nice things that people like to do”. This approach would “massively restrict which object graphs are valid” and “many Python object graphs in practice don’t look like this”, instead usually containing “reference loops”. Adopting the Rust ownership model in Python would “require rewriting most existing Python programs”.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Region-based ownership model</h2><p>The group proposed instead a “region-based model” they had designed called “Lungfish” that is “more permissive than Rust’s data model” but is “still data-race free”.&nbsp;</p><p>Regions are “namespaces for data”. Regions are a group of mutable objects that are isolated from the outside, and all contained objects are shared, transferred, or frozen altogether. Regions can be nested within other regions, too.</p><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg9PV7DIMN6qAHrsiZk1Vz0ybwx5ndJkfcSUzFMGi5c1WcyMNlVBzT0QAG4Yp9Ee7XNuBQwmcdbKUxyXkylC14LO39F8Sx-Qnla2_czkRAhNlcEV9WONc-65WWtaZSO_H_8G1GKwaYCt7454oz3Mu86jX-QRkjy6bU8a5P_QizcT3JyCQNlrw/s588/Screenshot%20from%202025-06-04%2017-14-42.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="259" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg9PV7DIMN6qAHrsiZk1Vz0ybwx5ndJkfcSUzFMGi5c1WcyMNlVBzT0QAG4Yp9Ee7XNuBQwmcdbKUxyXkylC14LO39F8Sx-Qnla2_czkRAhNlcEV9WONc-65WWtaZSO_H_8G1GKwaYCt7454oz3Mu86jX-QRkjy6bU8a5P_QizcT3JyCQNlrw/s320/Screenshot%20from%202025-06-04%2017-14-42.png" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-align: left;">Can’t move Region “r” to thread “2” because the borrow count is not 1.</span></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Regions are “an enclosure of objects” that is tracked by their “borrow count”, which is the number of references that are “pointing into a region”. Objects are “slurped” (technical term) into a Region, and the borrow count increases for each reference pointing into the region. Regions can only be “moved” when the borrow count is 1, and any moves that don’t have a borrow count of 1 indicate a data race and should raise an exception.</p><p><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi2-vE2D2yIPTfOuy2tDOlJXEfrE4XBn4c_82Aj_xdmD21XSdOrWQLdRFC6YS34Wb8Y8zXbED0krrqJMRaEaBwAlTWhDI1lV4Qw8lS-N30wZOcV8YeFwP2zGyfwS5wo3iKiISerIMxDmk3xBYtA_7PT1XhAtJEx363UO6wDkaxQZMGctafGvg/s657/Screenshot%20from%202025-06-04%2017-14-01.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="311" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi2-vE2D2yIPTfOuy2tDOlJXEfrE4XBn4c_82Aj_xdmD21XSdOrWQLdRFC6YS34Wb8Y8zXbED0krrqJMRaEaBwAlTWhDI1lV4Qw8lS-N30wZOcV8YeFwP2zGyfwS5wo3iKiISerIMxDmk3xBYtA_7PT1XhAtJEx363UO6wDkaxQZMGctafGvg/s320/Screenshot%20from%202025-06-04%2017-14-01.png" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-align: left;">Threads 1 and 2 share region r, where thread 1 holds the lock with access to the referenced region r, and has two references from X to A and Z to 42. Hence, the borrow count of 3.</span></td></tr></tbody></table></p><p>Another option is to share the ownership of a region between two or more threads. Doing so would “move the ownership of the region within a lock shared between threads”. “When a thread owns the lock, then that thread can create points within the region and access the data, and the borrow count increments”. This borrow count increment needs to happen to track when the thread can release the lock safely, meaning there are the correct number of references to objects within the region.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">What’s next for Lungfish and “Fearless Python”?</h2><p>The group has a plan to introduce Lungfish and its concepts to Python through a “series of four Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs)”. The order and current status of each PEP is the following:</p><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>The first PEP is for “deep immutability” and was “almost finished with 99% of tests passing on Python 3.12”. The team plans to upgrade to 3.13 and then submit the PEP.</li><li>The second PEP would propose “cyclic immutable garbage with reference counting” and also “adding atomic reference counting for the new immutable objects”. This PEP is around 80% done.</li><li>The third PEP would be for “sharing immutable data between threads and subinterpreters (PEP 734). Tobias added that “subinterpreters can be a good delivery model for some concurrency model on top of [subinterpreters]”. This PEP and project are around 50% done.</li><li>The fourth PEP would add sharing mutable data between threads and subinterpreters using Regions.</li></ul><p></p><p>Tobias closed by sharing why the project was named “Lungfish”: “the project can be used with or without GIL(s)” (pronounced “gills”), which was received with equal parts laughter and groans at the pun.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Discussion</h2><p>Barry Warsaw asked, “Would regions be a first-class data object in Python? Tobias answered “yes”, the proposal included a “<span style="font-family: courier;">Region()</span>” object that can be assigned names like so:</p><p><span style="font-family: courier;"><span style="white-space: normal;">r = Region()<br /></span>r.f = 42</span></p><p>Thomas Wouters wondered “whether regions would get used ubiquitously”, asking “which region does the sys module live in?” as a particularly difficult example. The group answered that they “are not sure what the answer is” and that there “are some concurrency issues there” and “that you want [the sys module] to be in a REPL thread”. “People in this room probably have better ideas here”.</p><p>David Hewitt, maintainer of the Rust PyO3 project, contrasted the proposed Region object with Rust’s “mutex” type and Python’s “Lock” type. Python’s Lock type doesn’t protect any data inside the lock, whereas Rust’s mutex type does protect data within the mutex. Rust’s mutex allows taking the data out of the mutex if you own the mutex, changing the mutability, and more, similar to Regions. David “has become familiar with the mutexes in Rust, and coming back to Python’s locks feels like a bit of a paper cut”.</p><p>David asked whether, instead of “introducing a new concept with Regions,” the three would introduce the concept more similar to a Rust mutex instead. Tobias answered that the protection mirrors the mutex, but that Regions uniquely allow nesting “to build a tree of regions” and a “notion of transitive closure of state in the object graph” that “transcends its use within a mutex, such as when the region is transferred or how freezing propagates within a region”. “Mutexes are one use of a Region, but not the only use”.</p><p>Donghee Na asked about the stability of existing behavior. Fridtjof answered that the three “had added tests specifically for the new behavior of immutability”, saying that the “immutability and freezing feature branches are really solid” and that the region feature branch is “more experimental”.</p><p>Donghee continued and asked whether the community would need to modify its code. Tobias answered, “Yes, if they want to take advantage of the benefits”. Matthew answered, “Pure Python can directly support regions, if you have a C library, then you’d need to add some modifications to your code to benefit”.</p><p>“C libraries would be an opt-in model at the module level”. This is similar to free-threading, where modules need to opt in; otherwise, the runtime doesn’t run with free-threading. “When you freeze an object graph, if [the runtime] encountered an object that doesn’t implement freezing, then you backtrack the freezing”. “You would need to register your types as freezeable”.</p><p>Martin DeMello asked whether freezing a region was a “one-way operation,” noting that freezing a region removes the object graph. Tobias answered that at the moment, “it does not allow [frozen objects] to be mutated until [the frozen objects] hit the finalizer, which turns objects back to be mutable again”. “We could do something like you’re proposing, I’m just worried,” with laughter at the mention of the finalizer. Tobias added a comment about “a potential copy-on-write” type to allow users to enable this use case.</p><p>Pablo Galindo Salgado asked about C extensions, “If I incref (increase a reference count), how does the region know whether this is an internal reference or an external reference?” Fridtjof replied that “there are two answers”, first being that “if the C extension had opted in, the system assumes that [the C extension author] is doing the right things” which in Pablo’s case would require a <span style="font-family: courier;">PyRegion_IncRef()</span> function or similar. The second answer is that if the C extension doesn’t opt in, the system would be able to “reestablish the borrow count” for “backwards compatibility” by “leveraging the garbage collection mechanism that’s already there”.</p><p>Overall, there was definitely interest in the trio’s proposal from core developers due to the new problems that free-threaded Python will bring to Python users regarding concurrency.</p><div><br /></div>

            <p>Eric Snow opened his presentation about the Python Steering Council with an appreciation of current and former Steering Council members and all their hard work, which was met with applause from Language Summit attendees. “... and the same goes for Guido, who took 5 people to replace”.</p><p>“We’ve had several years of experience with the Steering Council”, Eric opened, “this discussion is meant to be an opportunity to talk about and identify ways to make the Steering Council better”.</p><p>Eric started by listing the aspects of the Steering Council that have worked, “the language and its projects haven’t stagnated”, many PEPs have been finalized, “and most notably, sensitive issues have come up and the Steering Council has demonstrated leadership”.</p><p>In Eric’s opinion, the biggest issue was that he had been “surprised” by some responses from the Steering Council. What factors make the work of the Steering Council difficult? “...being diligent about being fair and united, which takes time and effort”.</p><p>“Effort and time are limited resources for volunteers”. Eric identified that in addition to managing the language, the Steering Council has to spend time managing the Developers’ in Residence, doing community outreach, addressing Code of Conduct violations, and creating presentations for PyCon US.</p><p>“There’s a temptation to compare core development under Guido to core development under the Steering Council,” Eric admitted he’s caught himself doing in the past. “The comparison isn’t helpful or fair”.</p><p>For Eric, it isn’t always clear whether the Steering Council is the voice of consensus or whether they are the deciders. The Steering Council is “inherently a bottleneck of core development”. “The nature of committee work combined with a volunteer schedule means it can take a while to discuss and reach a decision”. This directly impacts the pace of runtime development.</p><p>Eric also highlighted that “there’s a [latency] penalty for PEP authors whenever there is a new Steering Council,” which, according to PEP 13, happens on a yearly cadence. This is despite having <a href="https://hugovk.github.io/python-steering-council/">a relatively consistent set of people on the Steering Council</a> year-over-year. Eric called out his own <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0554/">PEP 554</a>, being particularly affected by the Steering Council turnover.</p><p>“It’s difficult to not have feedback from [the Steering Council] in the midst of discussion thinking that there was consensus or that issues had settled only to be surprised by a later response from the Steering Council”. Eric shared that this had happened multiple times to him in the past and called the experience “deflating”. Eric said it seemed important to have a “sense of where the Steering Council or a delegate was on discussions as they unfolded”.</p><p>Eric was looking to discuss potential improvements, and he noted there had been a few in the past, including delegating decision-making and publishing notes.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Discussion</h2><p>Carol Willing, inaugural Steering Council member, commended Eric on “[doing] a great job putting together a positive presentation about the challenges”. What Carol remembered from the first Steering Council was thinking “there’s a ton of stuff to do and [she couldn’t] believe Guido was doing all of this on his own”. Carol identified that project management had become the biggest issue and that a “secretary or assistant role wasn’t the right terminology”. “It’s time to revisit the workload… [the problems] are largely due to the volume of stuff on the Steering Council’s plate”.</p><p>Brandt Bucher felt that the Steering Council appeared to have a policy of “don’t participate in discussions and only speak with one voice after the discussion had taken place”. Brandt felt this “didn’t feel like the leadership role he imagined the Steering Council would best function in”. Brandt referenced PEP 779, which received engagement from the community but hadn’t received any comments from the Steering Council.</p><p>Barry Warsaw, current Steering Council member, said he frequently asks himself, “Am I speaking as a core developer?” Barry referenced how Guido approached discussions and engaged as a core developer, not as a BDFL. Barry identified speaking with consensus as what he thought was the biggest delay, and that it “takes time and coordination”.</p><p>Pablo Galindo Salgado, also in the current Steering Council, shared that another issue was that you can’t only participate in discussions that you care about. There’s a scaling issue: “you have to participate in all PEP discussions, and not just to comment, you have to review [the PEP]”. Pablo also highlighted that there’s a problem of engaging with a topic as an individual core developer and then later discussing the topic within the Steering Council, having a different sentiment or reaction, thus causing surprise. “This will happen more if [core developers] expect the Steering Council to participate in discussions, and I am not sure that is going to fly”.</p><p>Emily Morehouse, Steering Council member, added that being on the Steering Council is a “seasonal job,” referencing the “onslaught of PEPs submitted ahead of the beta1 cut-off,” which was met with guilty laughter from core developers. Emily suggested being more transparent about a timeline for PEPs would be considered, and when PEPs would need to be submitted to be accepted in time for a particular release.</p><p>Mariatta asked about the transparency of funding for the Steering Council. “The Steering Council makes decisions about how the funding is spent, such as PyCon grants and sprints. Are there other ways that the funds can be spent? Can we request grants?”</p><p>Emily answered that much of the funding the Steering Council processes had already been “set aside” for specific goals like core developer sprints and the Developers-in-Residence program. Emily shared that “even as a Steering Council member, I want more transparency for [funding]” and that they are “striving for an annual report for how money is being spent”. Some of the funding is a “black box” for the Steering Council as well, so Emily agreed that there should be “more transparency, especially now that there is a substantial amount of money going through the Steering Council budget” and the ability to answer “what happens when we want to use money elsewhere?”</p><p>Carol agreed that “more transparency is needed and will solve a lot of the stress” that Steering Council members were feeling.</p><p>Guido van Rossum brought up the “Brown Act” in California, which requires that all meetings be open to the public for local government groups in charge of public infrastructure without private deliberations, barring personnel or sensitive issues. “It’s a completely different model” compared to the model set in the Steering Council charter, “but it gives a lot of transparency”. Guido liked the idea of “doing something dramatically different to get the situation unstuck”.</p><p>Pradyun Gedam commented on the continuity problem, which the <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2025/06/python-language-summit-2025-packaging-governance-process.html">newly proposed Packaging Council</a>, attempted to solve by “splitting the Packaging Council into two cohorts that are elected for two years each, offset by one year”. “This approach might help with some of the [continuity issues]”.</p><p>Thomas Wouters said when he was previously on the Steering Council that the members were “always trying to figure out what consensus was”. Thomas’s impression from a previous discussion about Zstandard was “going one way”, but after Gregory Smith ran a poll on Discourse, “the result was very different”. Thomas asked, “Does that mean we have been governing wrong, or should we be doing polls more often?”</p><p>Barry replied he thought that “polls are useful, but can’t be relied on completely” as they represented an “incomplete picture of the community”. “There are millions of users that will be affected and aren’t dialed in to Discourse, [the Steering Council] has to represent them, too”.</p><p>David Hewitt asked whether a majority of PEPs should be delegated, referencing the typing, packaging, and C API groups that exist already. Emily agreed that more delegation is a “good idea”, but “needed to be formal”. Emily said, “The typing council is a good example of a boundary of responsibility,” but “without a formal decision-making process, we end up with groups that want to help but don’t fulfill their responsibility”. Carol added that historically, most delegations were to individuals rather than working groups or councils.</p><p>Pablo also agreed that more delegation was good and that the Steering Council had already been delegating more and seeing success, referencing the typing council, documentation working group, and C API working group. But there are a few problems with the delegation model, like when the “people proposing the changes are a part of the council, so we can’t delegate to [that council].” Pablo also highlighted that delegation was sometimes difficult when there were two opposed groups on an issue. Pablo concluded by saying that “the more working groups we have, the better, but [the Steering Council] can’t demand a working group, so if you want to organize more, please do!”</p><p>Emily highlighted more issues with delegation, saying that “we have seen a lot of competing areas that people are working on”. “We’re trying to see how all of these projects work together. [The Steering Council] can’t delegate one person to be the BDFL of the JIT because they will be looking at the JIT but actually need to be looking at many other projects”.</p><p><br /></p><p>“We’re in a territory that the Steering Council hasn’t had to deal with in a while”, Emily continued, suggesting that the Steering Council needed to contact folks involved in other large decisions in the Python language, such as the 2 to 3 transition.</p><div><br /></div>

        <div class="p-4 flex-grow overflow-hidden">
          <p class="text-base-content">
            <p>What do Python core developers want from future Rust support?</p><p>“This talk is very timely, Rust turns 10 years old tomorrow”. David Hewitt is the maintainer of PyO3, a library that allows Python developers to more easily use Rust within a Python project. “It takes time for languages to be adopted, the test is whether a decade later the language is used”. David noted that Rust had already been mentioned multiple times earlier in the Language Summit, but also in “the Python Software Foundation’s <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/comment/ONCD-2023-0002-0107">RFI response</a> to the US government about memory safety” regarding creating binary extensions.</p><p>“My belief is we’re all here to enable other developers, and we’re passionate about the tools we want to use ourselves,” noting that all opinions are valid today, whether folks want to use Rust or not.</p><p>David showed a graph of which languages are being used by packages on the Python Package Index (PyPI) with C, C++, Rust, and others. “Our best estimate is that somewhere between ¼ and ⅓ of all native code being uploaded to PyPI for new projects uses Rust”. “People are choosing to start new projects using Rust”.</p><p>David continued by sharing that PyO3 enables Python users to use Rust in their Python packages. He gave a short demonstration of how PyO3 can be used to create a simple Python module and function, and using Rust error handling in a way that maps directly to Python exceptions. PyO3 has its own build system in Maturin, is capable of generating type hints, and has many more developer-friendly features.</p><p>Where do Rust and Python need more work? Rust already “leans very well into supporting free-threading in Python”, but “sub-interpreters and module isolation are a challenge”. Rust has a “GCC backend” if you need to support “esoteric platforms”, but David conceded that “[GCC support] is not very mature yet, one for the future for sure”.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Should Python core developers invest in Rust?</h2><p>The main question that David came to the Language Summit with is in the title of the talk. “What do Python core developers want from the future of Rust support?” David broke the question down, asking whether core developers “wanted to design or endorse a Rust developer experience” for Python or if the core developers had an interest in Rust for their own toolkit.</p><p>Quoting the StackOverflow surveys, Rust is a “very well-loved language” and Rust developers “want to continue working with the language”. Anecdotally, David also shared that “many younger programmers are getting their start with Rust,” which could “increase the size of the talent pool” if Rust were invested in. David also suggested a “higher-level API” compared to the C API written in Rust, which could be a part of the “evolving the C API” to avoid the issues of backwards compatibility.</p><p>There are downsides too, David noted that going from one to two languages is a “massive step up in terms of complexity, both technical and social”. “There will probably be something better in the future, so why use it now?” David shared that “some folks believe Rust is ‘good-enough’ for what they need now, so they proceed”. Due to the current state of GCC support, “Rust would alienate esoteric platforms and that would be a shame”. David closed the downsides section with a note on naming: “CPython is ‘C + Python’, what does the C mean if there is Rust investment?”</p><p>David closed his presentation with a case study to look at for the adoption of Rust by a prominent C open source project: the Linux kernel. “Rust for Linux is a massively complicated project” and “[the project] is difficult not only technically but also socially” noting that some Linux kernel developers were pushing back against Rust for Linux either because they “don’t want to engage with Rust” or “don’t want their workflows to change”. Despite this, “Rust has been strategically valuable for the Linux kernel because the perception is that it enables a new generation of developers to continue contributing to the Linux kernel”.</p><p>Finally, David posed the question, “Is there a world for something like ‘Rust for Python’”?</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Discussion&nbsp;</h2><p>Fred Drake asked whether David “had done any work with free-threading”? David replied that “working with Rust makes it easy to comply with free-threading,” adding that “you’d have to be using the unsafe keyword or trying really hard” to break Python free-threading with Rust. Marking Rust extension modules as “safe for free-threading” is “a lot more straightforward compared to C”. David thanked the folks at Quansight Labs for their help on PyO3 in this area.</p><p>Martin DeMello asked about David’s examples, such as modularizing parts of the interpreter to Rust, and whether David “had tried creating a proof-of-concept?” David replied that he hadn’t tried linking a Rust object into the interpreter but “knows of mixed language projects like Firefox where Rust, C, and C++ are statically linked into the same binary”. David said it’s possible to do, but would be a “high-complexity prototype”.</p><p>Brandt Bucher, one of the contributors to CPython’s new JIT suggested that because the JIT is experimental and doesn’t use the CPython API that it may be an interesting candidate for being converted to Rust as a proof-of-concept although Brandt was clear he “wasn’t willing to do the work”.</p><p>Gregory Smith suggested starting with an extension module, as they are isolated. “We want a better build system, and we keep talking about it, but [a new build system] hasn’t manifested. It’s all about who is the one doing the work”. Thomas Wouters cautioned that non-optional parts of the standard library would be tough as they “would need to support all tiered platforms”. David agreed, saying that the “build system doesn’t have to happen first” and that the extension module approach was “analogous to the Rust for Linux project,” where certain areas of the kernel were moved to Rust first.</p><p>Barry Warsaw asked about the debuggability of Rust if it were adopted in CPython. David replied that the experience wouldn’t be much different. “Rust is creating native call stacks” and “you would see frames in the interpreter, in GDB you would see Rust symbols”.</p><p>Hood Chatham had concerns about bloat from panic and symbols for Rust objects being linked to the interpreter. David recommended turning off panic and disabling the Rust standard library, and that there were other ways to avoid bloat that the interpreter didn’t need. “Rust stable ABI is still in progress”.</p><p>Overall, after the discussion, core developers did not seem categorically opposed to an optional Rust extension module in the Python standard library, but the general consensus was that this work may hinge on some build system changes and questions around platform support.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p class="text-base-content">
            <p>Core developer and Python Docs Editorial Board member Mariatta presented an update on the Python Docs Editorial Board to the Language Summit. Mariatta credited her fellow board members Carol Willing, Guido van Rossum, Joanna Jablonski, and Ned Batchelder for putting together the presentation.</p><p>Mariatta started with the mission and vision of the Python Docs Editorial Board, including improving the quality of the Python documentation, getting consensus, and being the final decision makers for documentation issues. Mariatta pointed to the <a href="http://python.github.io/editorial-board">editorial board’s website</a>, which hosts meeting minutes and a “changelog” of decisions.</p><p>Mariatta highlighted a few recent decisions, including using the vertical bar (“|”) instead of “or” when describing type information in function parameters and the use of “timezone” versus “time zone” in prose. Ned Batchelder is <a href="https://devguide.python.org/contrib">working on the developer guide</a>, which will “eventually become the new contributors guide for Python”. The group is also modernizing Python tutorials, and Joanna Jablonski and Savannah Bailey are auditing the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html">argparse module documentation</a>.</p><p>Mariatta shared that the vision of the Docs Editorial Board is to change Python documentation into a community resource. They hope to do this by making decisions to encourage new contributors and by reducing instances of an individual claiming ownership of a document. The board shared they are “seeing improvement” on this front.</p><p>Mariatta celebrated that the board was seeing more collaboration among different groups, such as a renewed emphasis on translations and usability of the documentation. Folks from the Python Software Foundation Education and Outreach Working Group have come to the documentation Discord asking questions and offering help.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Discussion</h2><p>A short, rapid-fire discussion broke out amongst core developers about the sometimes unfortunate state of pages on the “<a href="http://python.org">python.org</a>” subdomain, such as a multitude of wikis. Thomas Wouters and Ned Deily remarked on the previous website revamp and how to avoid breakages, it was “easier to keep pages around, but that doesn’t mean anyone is responsible for the pages”.</p><p>Carol Willing, speaking for herself, thought it was “overdue to get rid of links to the wiki, particularly ones that have beginner Python stuff”. PSF executive director Deb Nicholson added that the PSF board was taking a “super macro view of <a href="http://python.org">python.org</a>” and to “get in touch with the User Success Working Group if people have questions”.</p><p>Python documentation translations were a big topic of conversation during this Language Summit session. Mariatta noted that there were a few language translation groups that were “successful”, giving Korean and Spanish Python docs translations as examples. “We want to learn from groups like that so that even more languages can have that experience”, Mariatta shared, noting that <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0545/">PEP 545</a>, which documents the Python documentation translation guide, focused too heavily on “getting started” rather than “how to continue”.</p><p>One of the highlighted issues of PEP 545 was that there would be a single coordinator and no process for adding additional translation coordinators in the case that existing coordinators weren’t available. Mariatta asked the group whether a new governance process, subcommittee, or working group might be able to step in in these situations to “unblock a translation community”.</p><p>Lysandros Nikolaou, who has been involved in the Greek translation of the Python docs, highlighted that knowledge-sharing across different translation groups is difficult and a significant barrier to other translations being successful, especially those with smaller communities. “PEP 545 specifies that translations have to have content in the translation language related to the CLA and license,” and this requirement “makes it very difficult for different communities to interact with each other and share knowledge”.</p><p>Lysandros shared how the Greek translation group started by “going to the Spanish translation repository and then translating [their processes] from Spanish to English to know what to do”. Lysandros argued that having only one translation coordinator shouldn’t be allowed, and that it’s “difficult enough working on a translation project let alone just one person working on [the translation project]” and that many teams that work on translations know “very little about how to do [process] documentation”. Lysandros agreed that bringing together coordinators would be helpful to every translation.</p><p>Donghee Na suggested standardizing on the translation platform across translation groups so that each group can focus their energy on the translation instead of “focusing energy on redoing the same work over and over”.</p>

            <p><a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0772/">PEP 772</a> proposes a Packaging Governance Process through a new Python Packaging Council of 5 members (similar to the Python Steering Council). The entire project is a collaboration between Barry Warsaw, Pradyun Gedam, and Python Software Foundation Executive Director Deb Nicholson.</p><p>“Packaging is critical to Python’s success”, Barry opened, “Python has grown from a grassroots effort and now needs some formalization; now is the time for Packaging”. Barry explained that the Packaging Governance effort has grown out of the <a href="http://wheelnext.dev/">WheelNext initiative</a>. Wheelnext touches many aspects of Python packaging, including installers, the wheel archive format, the Python Package Index, and CPython.</p><p>The Packaging Council was modeled after PEP 13 and the Python Steering Council, with a mandate for packaging standards and <a href="http://packaging.python.org">packaging.python.org</a>. Authority would be given through the Python Steering Council, similar to how the Steering Council delegates packaging PEP decisions today.</p><p>There are still some open questions that were likely discussed in more detail at the Packaging Summit, also at PyCon US 2025. Barry enumerated a few issues the group was concerned with, such as how to seed the initial voting membership to form the first Packaging Council, whether to use Python Packaging Authority members, the PSF Packaging Working Group, core developer members, or likely some combination of multiple groups interested in Python packaging.</p><p>Barry shared that the Council would likely be in regular communication with the Steering Council but was weighing their options on how to best do updates to the community, either using <a href="http://discuss.python.org">discuss.python.org</a>, Discord, or some other method. Also suggested was being able to share some staffing resources with the Steering Council, such as the Developers-in-Residence.</p><p>Pradyun added to the motivation for a Packaging Council, such as there only being “one standing delegate” for packaging PEPs. Pradyun also added that Python packaging is difficult to reason about, “the various pieces are all over, and you need to know everything to make things happen”.</p><p>Deb Nicholson shared that the Python Software Foundation gets contacted about packaging and improvements. “We have funding for packaging work, but we don’t have an entity to ask”. What the PSF wants is a group like the Python Steering Council functions, takes the community temperature, and knows who is interested and whether that entity can work with that PSF so that ideas can get all the way across the finish line”.</p><p>Barry clarified that the Packaging Council isn’t going to mandate what third-party tools have to do. The council intends to foster standards for interoperability while “still allowing lots of room for innovation and new ideas”. “Backwards compatibility is one of the axioms of Python packaging,” noted Barry and Pradyun agreed, saying that 12-year-old Python packages “still work” with current tools.</p><p>Thomas Wouters asked what Paul Moore, the standing delegate for packaging PEPs, thought of the packaging council PEP. Pradyun responded that “Paul likes the idea”. Deb shared that she had spoken with Paul “at length” and that some of the same problems are being felt with packaging as with Python and the Steering Council. “The amount of work to do compared to 5 years ago has increased 100 times over”. The three had been speaking to many others who have done packaging governance and conducting interviews. Most importantly, “people who have put in the work get to weigh in on PEP 772”.</p><div><br /></div>

            <p>Russell Keith-Magee and Malcolm Smith were at the Language Summit this year to announce the status of mobile support for Python: “After many years, this year I can say that [Python on mobile] is there!” Russell proudly declared, with a large round of applause from the room.</p><p>All of the changes for <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0730">PEP 730</a> and <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0738">PEP 738</a> have been completed, and for Python 3.13, both iOS and Android are Tier 3 supported platforms. Continuous Integration (CI) is very stable, and failures are not because of iOS or Android.</p><p>Russell and Malcolm both wanted to know what was necessary for <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0011/#tier-2">Tier 2 support</a> for iOS and Android. Tier 2 support means that releases are blocked when there are failures for the listed platforms, and that any breakages on those platforms during normal Python development would either need to be fixed or reverted within 24 hours of being detected by build bots.</p><p>The platforms both had the requisite 2 maintainers and stable continuous integration via buildbots. The only outstanding question was about whether official “artifacts” or “binaries” are needed for Tier 2 support, which Ned Deily dismissed, stating that “Linux is Tier 1 and doesn’t provide binary artifacts”. Knowing this, Russell and Malcom will proceed with requesting Tier 2 support for iOS and Android.</p><p>Russell asked if iOS and Android tests could be added to the GitHub Actions CI that runs on every pull request, making failures more visible (compared to buildbots, which must be explicitly requested). Russell noted that these test runs would not affect CI times due to being shorter than an existing job: the Windows x86-64 free-threaded GitHub Action. The only downside? Running iOS would require macOS ARM runners, which are “in short supply”. Ee Durbin, Director of Infrastructure at the Python Software Foundation, was able to purchase more macOS ARM runners shortly after this issue was identified.</p><p>Russell also requested a single-process GitHub Actions run using a Linux runner to catch common issues that fail on mobile, like test cases not being annotated properly as using subprocesses. Thomas Wouters agreed with the proposal to add a single-process test run, noting that this configuration “actually captures bugs” and makes it “easier for the pull request owner to fix issues”.</p><p>As far as Python packages go, the Beeware team has made progress; pip and PyPI both support iOS and Android wheels. The build tool Meson is adding support for iOS, and Malcom Smith is adding support for Android. Commonly used tools like “cibuildwheel” would require pre-compiled binaries in order to build mobile-friendly wheels, and “ideally these would be official CPython builds”. The team plans to work on more high-profile packages, like cryptography, to create mobile-friendly wheels.</p><p>The Beeware team is maintaining more Apple platforms than only iOS, such as the Apple tvOS, watchOS, and visionOS platforms. Each of these platforms has its own set of patches. Russell asked whether each of these platforms that are quite similar to each other needed their own Tier 3 status for the patches to be upstreamed to Python.</p><p>Russell then asked whether the top-level platform directories can be backported to previous versions of Python to accommodate the single XCode project for all platforms proposal. Thomas Wouters, release manager for Python 3.13 and 3.12, was happy to accept backported platform directories as they were unlikely to break many users. Ned Deily agreed and noted that “[he’d] like to get rid of everything in the Mac directory”.</p><p>The final question was regarding sysconfig data for mobile builds. Russell noted that mobile binaries are relocatable, but sysconfig data isn’t inherently relocatable and that this is “not just a mobile issue, also affects desktop relocatable and macOS framework builds”. Thomas chimed in again to say that sysconfig data was a “huge problem and not just for [mobile] because it’s tied to the build system”. “We should do something else and get rid of sysconfig data,” which received multiple claps and agreement amongst core developers.</p><p>Overall, the mobile story for Python is shaping up nicely, and after the Language Summit talk will likely be even more stable throughout the Python development process thanks to improvements in continuous integration and testing.</p><div><br /></div>

            <h2 style="text-align: left;">In memoriam: Michael Foord</h2><p>Larry Hastings led a moment of silence to remember former core developer Michael Foord, who passed away earlier this year. Michael was known for many things, including “starting the tradition of having the Language Summit events at PyCon”. You can <a href="http://discuss.python.org">read the memorial for Michael Foord on discuss.python.org</a>.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Pluggable JITs</h2><p>The first lightning talk was delivered by Martin DeMello from Meta. Martin works on the <a href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/cinder">Cinder Just-in-Time compiler</a> (JIT) at Meta which is “one of two Python JITs”. Martin asks whether there is room for alternative or “pluggable” JITs and envisions a future where a JIT would be pip-installable, a-la “pip install jit”.</p><p>To be able to build pluggable JITs, the CPython project would need to provide three things:</p><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li><span style="font-family: courier;">PyAPI_UnstableFunc()</span></li><li><span style="font-family: courier;">PyEval_EvalFrameJIT()</span></li><li>User-defined opcodes</li></ul><p></p><p>This would avoid the need for other projects like Cinder to copy substantial amounts of CPython code or fork CPython to provide a JIT. JITs need publicly linkable access to low-level functions. Martin has received “pushback” for this sort of API access, but said that “if the social contract is that you have to keep up with language features yourself this would be enough for JIT use”.</p><p>Opcodes are a “small namespace” of only 255 values, so “one opcode could be provided for user opcodes and require opargs unpacking” to avoid forking the Python interpreter. The <span style="font-family: courier;">PyEval_EvalFrameJIT()</span> API would be used instead of <span style="font-family: courier;">PyEval_EvalFrame()</span> when a pluggable JIT was used to allow the custom JIT to evaluate frames. See <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0523/">PEP 523</a> for more information about Python’s current JIT.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Virtual Threads from Java</h2><p>Mark Shannon asked, “Did Java get threads right?” Mark recently opened a <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/add-virtual-threads-to-python/91403">thread on Python Discourse</a> about adding Virtual Threads to Python. Virtual threads are “like green threads” in Java and are built on delimited continuations. Java uses “stackful symmetric” coroutines compared to Python’s “stackless asymmetric coroutines”. Stackful means that code can yield from deep within the call stack, meaning that code avoids the “<a href="https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2015/02/01/what-color-is-your-function/">What color is your function?</a>” problem.</p><p>Mark shared a demo that started, briefly ran, and stopped over a million virtual threads, which “if you had been using system threads would have crashed your VM”. Virtual threads are a “bit heavier weight than coroutines”, but might be worth it for the benefits. “Threads don’t scale very well in free-threading”, where if virtual threads are combined with system threads, programs can get better performance. Mark encouraged others to take a look at the proposal on Discourse.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Null Coalescing Operators “??”</h2><p>Noah Kim proposed adding “null coalescing operators” to Python. Earlier in 2025, Noah <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/revisiting-pep-505/74568">opened a thread</a> on <a href="http://discuss.python.org">discuss.python.org</a> about reviving <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0505/">PEP 505</a>. Instead of “null”, the operators would be “None’-aware. The three operators being proposed are:</p><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>None-aware access “?.”</li><li>None-aware comparison “??”</li><li>None-aware assignment “??=”</li></ul><p></p><p>Noah shared an example of using each operator. None-aware access is useful for regular expressions to “concisely emulate ‘if is None’ behavior into a single line”:</p><blockquote style="border: none; margin: 0px 0px 0px 40px; padding: 0px;"><p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: courier;">re.fullmatch(“pat”)?.span() == (0, 6)</span></p></blockquote><p>Defaults using None can be improved using None-aware comparison and assignment:</p><blockquote style="border: none; margin: 0px 0px 0px 40px; padding: 0px; text-align: left;"><p><span style="font-family: courier;">headers = headers ?? {“Content-Type”: “application/json”}</span></p><p><span style="font-family: courier;">headers ??= {“Content-Type”: “application/json”}</span></p></blockquote><p>Compared to:</p><blockquote style="border: none; margin: 0px 0px 0px 40px; padding: 0px; text-align: left;"><p><span style="font-family: courier;">if headers is None:</span></p><p><span style="font-family: courier;">&nbsp; &nbsp; headers = {“Content-Type”: “application/json”}</span></p></blockquote><p>Noah shared a potential future for a Python that “builds on none-ness as a core feature”, such as adding <span style="font-family: courier;">.first()</span> and <span style="font-family: courier;">.last()</span> methods to lists when combined with none-aware operators for simpler and more correct code.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Generative AI tooling vibe check</h2><p>Gregory Smith wanted to get a general vibe-check on AI auto-completion use within an integrated development environment to work on open source software. A rough count of hands in the room showed around half of the folks had used AI autocompletion, and between a third and a quarter of people had used “agentic” AI for open source work.&nbsp;</p><p>“CPython is a very old codebase,” and some modules are “ridiculous for humans to understand,” like the Unicode module. Greg recommended core developers to try out some of the new tools and said, “The upcoming year will be intense in terms of what can be done with the tools”.</p><p>Carol Willing shared that she had used and paid for a tool called “CodeVis”. Despite being “early days”, the tool lets you ask questions about a codebase. “Good for exploring codebases you don’t know”. Greg agreed, saying that the tools “can tell you where to go to make changes”. “None of us understand the entire [CPython] codebase. These tools are helpful when plugging into another place you’re not used to”.</p><p>Greg is “coordinating with the Python Software Foundation” on making these AI tools available for interested core developers.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Is “worse is better” still better?</h2><p>The creator of the Python programming language, Guido van Rossum, was next up and asked, “Is ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worse_is_better">worse is better</a>’ still better”? Guido conceded that this was “more a rant than a proposal” to “get core developers thinking”. Guido started by recounting earlier periods of Python development from 35 years ago, where he used UNIX “almost exclusively” and thus “Python was greatly influenced by UNIX’s ‘worse is better’ philosophy”.</p><p>“For Python, ‘worse is better’ has served me really well for a long time”, especially when Guido was writing most of the code. Guido shared many of the ways that early Python versions were “worse” than what we have today, such as no long integers, being built on top of C stdio, not having classes, etc.</p><p>These limitations meant that Guido could “get something working in 3 months”. “Even in the language definition, I didn’t think hard about many design issues, I copied what I found in C and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_(programming_language)">ABC</a>, Python’s predecessor”.</p><p>“Over the years, every single thing where I took a shortcut was eventually fixed”. Dictionary hashing had been “rewritten twice”, “we have garbage collectors up the wazoo”, and “now we have a lot of tests. At the time we had no tests” shared Guido with chuckles from core developers.</p><p>“In those times, ‘worse is better’ was key to getting the language accepted. I couldn’t afford to work 3 years on language design without user feedback or endorphins from people giving me kudos”. The initial release of Python happened less than a year after its development began, and “none of the issues were fixed, except classes,” which “were added by an intern”.</p><p>“The fact that [Python] wasn’t perfect encouraged many people to start contributing. All of the code was straightforward, there were no thoughts of optimization”. “These early contributors also now had a stake in the language; [Python] was also their baby”. Guido shared that many of these contributors began advocating for Python within their individual places of work.</p><p>“Does ‘worse is better’ still have a role today?” Guido contrasted early development to how Python is developed now: “features that take years to produce from teams of software developers paid by big tech companies. The static type system requires an academic-level understanding of esoteric type system features.” And this isn’t just Python the language, “third-party projects like numpy are maintained by folks who are paid full-time to do so”.</p><p>“Now we have a huge community, but very few people, relatively speaking, are contributing meaningfully.” Guido asked whether the expectation for Python contributors going forward would be that “you had to write a perfect PEP or create a perfect prototype that can be turned into production-ready code?” Guido opined for the “old days” where feature development could skip performance or feature-completion to get something into the hands of the community to “start kicking the tires”.</p><p>“Do we have to abandon ‘worse is better’ as a philosophy and try to make everything as perfect as possible?” Guido thought doing so “would be a shame”, but that he “wasn’t sure how to change it”, acknowledging that core developers wouldn’t want to create features and then break users with future releases.</p><p>Guido referenced David Hewitt’s PyO3 talk about Rust and Python, and that development “was using worse is better,” where there is a core feature set that works, and plenty of work to be done and open questions. “That sounds a lot more fun than working on core CPython”, Guido paused, “...not that I’d ever personally learn Rust. Maybe I should give it a try after,” which garnered laughter from core developers.</p><p>“Maybe we should do more of that: allowing contributors in the community to have a stake and care”.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Let’s benchmark memory as well</h2><p>Pablo Galindo Salgado, who is the maintainer of the <a href="https://github.com/bloomberg/memray">Python profiler Memray</a>, asserts that CPython should “also benchmark memory”. Execution speeds like “10% faster”, “dominate benchmarks”, but memory is “kinda important as well, especially because we’re doing big changes” and “[Python] is flying blind right now”.</p><p>“We’re measuring resident size of memory,” which is kinda like “one eye is blind”. Resident memory doesn’t show when the actual allocation is happening. Pablo also showed that resident memory can be affected by other programs running on your computer. For example, Pablo’s MacBook would non-deterministically move a large allocation of memory to “swap” after sleeping for long periods of time, and this would affect the resident memory graph.</p><p>Pablo shared other views into memory available on Linux, such as “working set memory”, showing the memory that your program is “touching”, and showing memory that is allocated but not being used. “Currently, we can’t use these types of memory, we only have one number, [resident memory] today”.</p><p>“Memory has become an afterthought, we are focusing too much on speed. Regressions in memory are usually accidental”. Pablo proposed <a href="http://memory.python.org">memory.python.org</a> or reusing performance infrastructure, and for the Python core developer team to create some memory-focused benchmarks.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">T-strings brain dump</h2><p>Lysandros Nikolaou gave “less a lightning talk” and “more a brain dump”. Lysandros showed off T-strings (<a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0750/">PEP 750</a>) and shared that an <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/133970">issue</a> was opened asking to make Templates and Interpolation types <a href="https://typing.python.org/en/latest/reference/generics.html">Generic</a>. Lysandros wondered if this was the correct approach or whether core developers needed to “think about the type system in general in a different way”. He didn’t think “any of the choices presented are good enough” for “people building DSLs or combining static analysis and parsing DSLs with runtime information on types”.</p><p>Lysandros closed by asking core developers to “think about how the type system will evolve under the unique possibilities that T-strings allow or whether the status quo is enough”.</p><div><br /></div>

            <p>The final talk presented at the Language Summit was given by Hood Chatham, who maintains the <a href="https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide">Pyodide project</a> and is trying to make <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch"><span style="font-family: courier;">fetch()</span></a> happen for Python (among many other JavaScript APIs).</p><p>Pyodide is an Emscripten Python for JavaScript runtimes like browsers, Node, and Deno. Emscripten is a “weird platform, but can run an amazing amount of software without modification,” explained Hood when describing the Pyodide project. Pyodide is a Tier 3 supported target for Python with <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0776/">PEP 776</a> (Emscripten Support) and <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0783/">PEP 783</a> (Emscripten Packaging).</p><p>“So why would someone ever use [Pyodide]?” asked Hood rhetorically, “[Pyodide] performance is not great compared to native Python,” although “some games using Pyodide can get respectable performance in a browser”. The answer is “every device has a browser” and “zero-installation sandboxed Python”. Hood shared that many Large Language Model (LLM) projects are using Pyodide and its sandbox in order to “run the nonsense that AI spits out, safely”. Pyodide also sees usage in other projects like <a href="https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Jupyter-Lite</a>, projects providing interactive web documentation to users, and among “educators and students”.</p><p>Hood added, “JavaScript is the operating system of the Web, and the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html">os module</a> only exposes a small subset of the fundamental capabilities of the Web. Python needs to be able to access all JavaScript functionality”.</p><p>Hood asked core developers whether the changes that Pyodide had made could be upstreamed to CPython. “[The changes] are needed to implement an event loop and to make requests with fetch()”. Hood explained that the Pyodide team had a prototype that allows calling “<span style="font-family: courier;">await <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch">fetch()</a></span> that just works.”</p><p>The prototype directly converts common types like strings, integers, floats, booleans, and None to and from JavaScript and proxies other objects. “Python and JavaScript have quite similar object models with a few differences,” and are capable of being mapped onto one another. Calling a JavaScript function proxies the arguments with borrowing, and the return value passes control back to the caller.</p><p>Hood “wasn’t sure how others would feel about this,” noting that “none of the changes would affect any other platforms besides Emscripten” but acknowledged the patches being “a weird set of code”.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Discussion</h2><p>Łukasz Langa was in favor of the proposal, for two reasons: Firstly, because “async cannot work without [upstream support] … the asyncio support in Pyodide goes around the event loop”. Łukasz continued, “secondly, Micropython recently got browser support” and “they have a JavaScript FFI that frustratingly is almost the same but different than Pyodide’s JavaScript FFI meaning it's impossible to write code that calls the same JavaScript APIs [without] a god-awful translation layer”. If Python were to have “an official JavaScript API, this would make [Damien George] tweak the Micropython JavaScript FFI to be the same” and that having matching JavaScript FFIs “would be a big win for JavaScript support for Python”.</p><p>Michael Droettboom had concerns about maintenance if the code were to be upstreamed to CPython. “Anytime the code breaks, it’ll be on you and a small number of Pyodide maintainers to fix”. Hood shared that most of the breakages experienced by the Pyodide project today are from changes to the C API, as “there are bindings that still require some private APIs”. Michael closed with “we’ll have to see the code”.</p><p>Carol Willing was concerned about the Pyodide project itself, given its success and whether “bringing Pyodide into CPython” would “cause confusion”. Hood agreed that there would be downsides to existing users, including documentation and cross-referencing to JavaScript APIs, acknowledging that there are different expectations compared to CPython.</p>

          <p class="text-base-content">
            <p>There is currently an explosion of people sharing their experiences with
agentic coding.  After my last <a href="/2025/6/4/changes/">two</a> <a href="/2025/6/10/genai-criticism/">posts</a> on the topic, I received quite a few
questions about my own practices.  So, here goes nothing.</p>
<h2>Preface</h2>
<p>For all intents and purposes, here&#8217;s what I do: I predominently use
<a href="https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code">Claude Code</a> with the cheaper
Max subscription for $100 a month <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>.  That works well for several
reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I exclusively use the cheaper Sonnet model. It&#8217;s perfectly adequate for
my needs, and in fact, I prefer its outputs over the more expensive Opus
model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I optimize my tool usage to be token efficient. I avoid screenshots and
browser interactions wherever possible.  More on that later.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>My general workflow involves assigning a job to an agent (which
effectively has full permissions) and then waiting for it to complete the
task.  I rarely interrupt it, unless it&#8217;s a small task.  Consequently, the
role of the IDE — and the role of AI in the IDE — is greatly diminished;
I mostly use it for final edits.  This approach has even revived my usage
of Vim, which lacks AI integration.</p>
<p>One caveat: I expect this blog post to age very poorly.  The pace of
innovation here is insane; what was true a month ago barely holds true
today.  That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m sticking to concepts I believe have staying power.</p>
<p>If you want to a small session of me working on an Open Source library
with it, I have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQYXZCUvpIc">a recording you can watch</a>.</p>
<h2>The Basics</h2>
<p>I disable all permission checks.  Which basically means I run <code>claude --dangerously-skip-permissions</code>.  More specifically I have an alias
called <code>claude-yolo</code> set up.  Now you can call that irresponsible and
there are definitely risks with it, but you can manage those risks with
moving your dev env into docker.  I will however say that if you can watch
it do its thing a bit, it even works surprisingly well without
dockerizing.  YMMV.</p>
<p>MCP.  This is a term you cannot avoid.  It basically is a standardized
protocol to give agents access to more tools.  Honestly: at this point I
barely use it, but I do use it.  The reason I barely use it is because
Claude Code is very capable of just running regular tools.  So MCP for me
is really only needed if I need to give Claude access to something that
finds too hard to use otherwise.  A good example for this is the
<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp">playwright-mcp</a> for
browser automation.  I use it because I haven&#8217;t found anything better yet.
But for instance when I want my agent to poke around in my database, I
just uses whatever it finds to be available.  In my case it loves to use
<code>psql</code> and that&#8217;s more than good enough.</p>
<p>In general I really only start using MCP if the alternative is too
unreliable.  That&#8217;s because MCP servers themselves are sometimes not super
reliable and they are an extra thing that can go wrong.  Trying to keep
things very simple.  My custom tools are normal scripts that it just runs.</p>
<h2>Choice Of Language</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve evaluated agent performance across different languages my workload,
and if you can choose your language, I strongly recommend Go for new
backend projects.  Several factors strongly favor Go:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Context system:</strong> Go provides a capable copy-on-write data bag that
explicitly flows through the code execution path, similar to contextvars
in Python or .NET&#8217;s execution context.  Its explicit nature greatly
simplifies things for AI agents.  If the agent needs to pass stuff to
any call site, it knows how to do it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Test caching:</strong> Surprisingly crucial for efficient agentic loops. In
Rust, agents sometimes fail because they misunderstand <code>cargo test</code>&#8216;s
invocation syntax.  In Go, tests run straightforwardly and
incrementally, significantly enhancing the agentic workflow.  It does
not need to figure out which tests to run, go does.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Go is sloppy:</strong> Rob Pike famously described Go as suitable for
developers who aren&#8217;t equipped to handle a complex language.  Substitute
“developers” with “agents,” and it perfectly captures why Go&#8217;s
simplicity benefits agentic coding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Structural interfaces:</strong> interfaces in Go are structural.  If a type
has the methods an interface expects, then it conforms.  This is
incredibly easy for LLMs to “understand”.  There is very little surprise
for the agent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Go has low eco-system churn:</strong> Go&#8217;s entire ecosystem embraces
backwards compatiblity and explicit version moves.  This greatly reduces
the likelihood of AI generating outdated code — starkly contrasting
JavaScript&#8217;s fast-moving ecosystem for instance.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For comparison, Python — my initial choice — often poses significant
challenges.  Agents struggle with Python&#8217;s magic (eg: Pytest’s fixture
injection) or complex runtime challenges (eg: wrong event loop when
working with async), frequently producing incorrect code that even the
agentic loop has challenges resolving.  Python also has practical
performance problems.  I don&#8217;t mean that it writes slow code, i mean that
the agent loop is really slow.  That&#8217;s because the agent loves to spawn
processes and test scripts, and it can take quite a while for the
interpreter to boot up and initialize the entire application.</p>
<p>On the frontend I settled on tailwind, react with tanstack&#8217;s query and
router as well as vite.  I&#8217;m not amazingly happy with it, but I found it
better than the alternatives.  Tailwind and vite are great, no complaints
there.  Tanstack&#8217;s file based router does not make me super happy.  In
parts because it likes to have dollar signs in the file names and those
really like to confuse the agent.  For instance it&#8217;s quite common that it
tries to edit <code>$param.tsx</code> but it edits the file <code>.tsx</code> instead because it
to confused by shell interpolation.  It&#8217;s a minor thing, but a very
annoying thing.</p>
<h2>Tools, Tools, Tools</h2>
<p>Regardless of language, effective tooling is paramount.  Key rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Anything can be a tool</strong>.  A shell script can be a tool, an MCP server
can be a tool, a log file can be a tool.  If the agent can interact or
observe it, it counts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tools need to be <strong>fast</strong>.  The quicker they respond (and the less
useless output they produce) the better.  Crashes are tolerable; hangs
are problematic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tools need to be <strong>user friendly</strong>!  Tools must clearly inform agents of
misuse or errors to ensure forward progress.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tools need to be <strong>protected against an LLM chaos monkey</strong> using them
completely wrong.  There is no such things as user error or undefined
behavior!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tools need to provide the right <strong>debuggability and observability</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Example: I place critical tools into a <code>Makefile</code>.  A <code>make dev</code> command
starts my services via a process manager. I made two key changes to what I
normally do:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I had to protect the process manager against being spawend a second
time when it&#8217;s already running.  I use a <a href="https://gist.github.com/mitsuhiko/8ca80fda0bf48045d54bcd34d76ad887">fork of shoreman</a>
which writes a pidfile.  When spanwed a second time it errors and logs
“services already running”.  Why does that matter?  Because the agent
sometimes does not know if the server is already running and otherwise
happily spawns it a second time resulting in two version of the
service bound to the same port.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am not only printing the output to my terminal, I&#8217;m also always
logging it to a file.  This allows the agent to read the log file to
diagnose what&#8217;s happening.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Here an example agentic interaction that demonstrates this rather well:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>⏺ Great! The formatting looks good. Now let me run the development server to test the
   dynamic onboarding:

⏺ Bash(make dev)
  ⎿  Error: error: services are already running
     make: *** [dev] Error 1

⏺ The development server is already running. Let me check the logs to see the frontend URL:

⏺ Bash(make tail-log)
  ⎿ 01:06:55 backend    | Starting server on localhost:8080
    01:07:39 backend    | [Running: sh -c 'cd backend &amp;&amp; go run cmd/server/main.go serve']
    01:07:39 backend    | Starting server on localhost:8080
    08:45:34 backend    | &quot;GET http://localhost:8080/api/users/me HTTP/1.1&quot; from 127.0.0.1:61804 - 200
    39.252666ms
    … +96 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Perfect! I can see the frontend is running on http://localhost:3000/ and the latest changes
   have been hot-reloaded. Let me test the dynamic onboarding functionality using playwright:
</pre></div>
<p>In general logging is super important.  For instance my app currently has
a sign in and register flow that sends an email to the user.  In debug
mode (which the agent runs in), the email is just logged to stdout.  This
is crucial!  It allows the agent to complete a full sign-in with a remote
controlled browser without extra assistence.  It knows that emails are
being logged thanks to a <code>CLAUDE.md</code> instruction and it automatically
consults the log for the necessary link to click.</p>
<p>Does it count as a tool?  In my book it does.</p>
<h2>It&#8217;s All About Speed</h2>
<p>Agentic coding&#8217;s inefficiency largely arises from inference cost and
suboptimal tool usage.  Let me reiterate: quick, clear tool responses are
vital.  What we did not talk about yet is that some tools are &#8220;emergent,&#8221;
temporarily written by agents themselves.  Quick compilation and execution
significantly boost productivity of the agent.  So how can we help it?</p>
<p>With the right instructions it must be possible for the AI to create a new
tool, by following existing conventions very quickly.  This is necessary
because you want the AI to write some new code, and run it.  There is a
big difference in the quality and speed of the flow, if that tool takes
3ms to run vs it compiles for 5 seconds and then needs another minute to
boot and connect to database and kafka broker and 100 lines of nonsensical
log output.</p>
<p>If your stuff is indeed slow, then consider vibe-coding a daemon that you
can dynamically load stuff into.  As an example Sentry takes too long to
reload code and it takes too long to restart.  To trial some agentic
coding there my workaround was a module that watches a file system
location and just imports and executes all python modules placed there,
then writes the outputs into a log it can cat.  That&#8217;s not perfect, but it
was a significant help for the agent to evaluate some basic code in the
context of the application.</p>
<p>Balancing log verbosity is crucial: informative yet concise logs optimize
token usage and inference speed, avoiding unnecessary costs and rate
limits.  If you cannot find the balance, provide some easy to turn knobs
for the AI to control.</p>
<p>In an idea setup you get useful log output as a natural byproduct of the
agent writing code.  Getting observability from the first shot of code
generation beats writing code, failing to run it and only then going back
to a debug loop where debug information is added.</p>
<h2>Stability and Copy/Paste</h2>
<p>Stable ecosystems are what you really want.  LLMs are great with Go and
they love to use Flask, because those are quite stable ecosystems with
little churn.  The same thing is true for your codebase.  The AI likes to
leave all kinds of breadcrumbs lying around when writing code that can
turn into confusion later.  For instance I have seen the agents leave
useful comments about why it chose one path over another.  If you
nilly-willy let the AI upgrade libraries where some of those decisions no
longer make sense, you now might have the AI continue making a now
outdated pattern.</p>
<p>In theory this should be the same for agents and humans, but the reality
is that agents make upgrades so “cheap” that it&#8217;s tempting to just let the
AI do it and see if tests still pass.  I do not find this to be a
successful path at all.  Be even more conservative about upgrades than
before.</p>
<p>Likewise with AI I strongly prefer more code generation over using more
dependencies.  I wrote about why you <a href="/2025/1/24/build-it-yourself/">should write your own code</a> before, but the more I work with
agentic coding, the more I am convinced of this.</p>
<h2>Write Simple Code</h2>
<p>Simple code significantly outperforms complex code in agentic contexts.  I
just recently wrote about <a href="https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2025/2/20/ugly-code/">ugly code</a> and I think in the
context of agents this is worth re-reading.  Have the agent do “the
dumbest possible thing that will work”.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Prefer functions</strong> with clear, descriptive and longer than usual
function names over classes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid inheritance and overly clever hacks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Use plain SQL</strong>.  I mean it.  You get excellent SQL out of agents and
they can match the SQL they write with the SQL logs.  That beats them
min-maxing your ORM&#8217;s capabilities and getting lost in the SQL output in
a log.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Keep important checks local.</strong>  You really want to make sure that
permission checks are very clear to the AI, and that they are taking
place where it AI can see it.  Hiding permission checks in another file
or some config file will amost guarantee you that the AI will forget to
add permission checks in when adding new routes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Make It Parallelizable</h2>
<p>Agents aren&#8217;t exceptionally fast individually, but parallelization boosts
overall efficiency.  Find a way to manage shared states like the file
system, databases, or Redis instances so that you can run more than one.
Avoid them, or find a way to quickly segment stuff out.</p>
<p>Your initial shared state is just the file system and a second check-out
will do.  But really I don&#8217;t have an amazing solution yet.  There are some
good initial attempts.  For instance one of the tools to watch is
<a href="https://github.com/dagger/container-use">container-use</a>.  It&#8217;s an MCP
server that instructs Claude or other agents to run their experiments
entirely in Docker.</p>
<p>Then there are tools like Cursor&#8217;s background agents and Codex which are
moving this entire stuff into CI which will be interesting.  So far, I
don&#8217;t this is working for me yet, but let&#8217;s see again in a month.</p>
<h2>Learn To Refactor</h2>
<p>Agentic coding alters refactoring priorities.  Agents handle tasks
effectively until project complexity surpasses some manageable thresholds.
Too big here is defined by the total amount of stuff that it has to
consider.  So for instance you can vibe code your frontend together for a
while, but eventually you reach the point where you absolutely need to
tell it to make a component library.  Why?  Because if the total tailwind
class mess is splitered across 50 files you will find it very hard to get
the AI to make redesigns or extract components without major regressions.</p>
<p>An agentic workflow encourages good code maintenance and refactoring at
the right moment.  You don&#8217;t want to do it too early and you definitely do
not want to do it too late.</p>
<h2>What Next?</h2>
<p>Agentic coding is rapidly evolving, and my workflow today may look
dramatically different tomorrow.  What&#8217;s clear though is that integrating
agents into your development process can unlock significant productivity
gains.  I encourage you to keep experimenting.  The tools and techniques
will evolve, but the core principles — simplicity, stability,
observability and smart parallelization — will remain essential.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the goal is not just to leverage agents to write code faster,
but to write better, more maintainable, and resilient code.  Already today
the code looks nothing like the terrible slop from a few months ago.  Stay
adaptable, and happy coding!</p>

            <p>I&rsquo;m pretty much fully back to normal life after PyCon US 2025.</p>

<p>I started writing this post shortly after PyCon, got side-tracked, and now I&rsquo;m finally publishing it.</p>

<p><strong>My very quick recap</strong>: I spent a ton of time at PyCon chatting with folks and I <em>really</em> enjoyed it.
As Ned wrote, <a href="https://nedbatchelder.com/blog/202505/pycon_summer_camp.html">it&rsquo;s like summer camp</a>.</p>

<h2>My pre-conference (Monday and Tuesday)</h2>

<p>I flew in a couple days early (Monday May 12) because Breeze airlines had a non-stop flight from San Diego to Pittsburgh that only ran on Monday or Friday.
I listened to <a href="http://robertdputnam.com/the-upswing/">The Upswing</a> as I flew in and wondered <a href="https://mastodon.social/@treyhunner/114496799621377766">how we can make our community less individualistic</a>.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, I went on <a href="https://mastodon.social/@treyhunner/114495825740774796">a walking tour</a> of downtown Pittsburgh.
Then I ate Indian food for lunch at Sree&rsquo;s, which I chose because I saw they had great vegan lunch options and weren&rsquo;t open for dinner.
I was eating vegan during PyCon US (as I <em>mostly</em> do at home) and I remembered to do <a href="https://mastodon.social/@treyhunner/114506541091205849">some research on vegan dinner restaurants in the area</a> this year.</p>

<p>On Tuesday night, as CPython core devs started showing up in the Westin lobby, I went on a walk with Anthony Shaw.
Anthony asked whether I was up for &ldquo;an adventure&rdquo; and I said yes without asking questions.
We walked across the river to Randyland (a.k.a. &ldquo;the mattress factory&rdquo;).
It was fun, interesting, and quite odd.
We were the only ones there and had plenty of time to look around at all the interesting items and art pieces that Randy had collected.</p>

<p>Anthony and I did dinner at Condado&rsquo;s and ran into more conference friends at the bar (Kattni, Rose, and Kojo).</p>

<h2>My tutorial on decorators (Wednesday)</h2>

<p>Wednesday was my tutorial day.</p>

<p>Attendees used sticky notes during the exercise sections to note when they needed help.
I wrote about this system in my <a href="https://treyhunner.com/2025/05/how-to-give-a-great-pycon-tutorial/">blog post of tips for giving a good PyCon tutorial</a>.</p>

<p>The tutorial went well and the attendees seemed to enjoy it.</p>

<h2>The newcomer&rsquo;s orientation &amp; education summit (Thursday)</h2>

<p>Just before the opening reception on Thursday evening, Kojo, Sumana, and I ran the <a href="https://mastodon.social/@pycon@fosstodon.org/114512798321665686">newcomer&rsquo;s orientation</a>.
Figuring out what exactly we want to say to help orient folks to PyCon is always a bit challenging.
A first-time PyCon attendee gave me some ideas for how we could do it even better next year.
I&rsquo;ve taken notes and will revisit them later.</p>

<p>I also attended a few talks during education summit earlier in the day.
Reuven Lerner gave a talk on how he recommends his students use LLMs and I was pleased to hear many suggestions that are closely aligned with what I recommend as well as a few insights I hadn&rsquo;t heard before.</p>

<h2>My lightning talk (Friday)</h2>

<p>I gave a lightning talk on Friday evening (the first talk day).
I called it <a href="https://youtu.be/Uuhu-F05A7k?feature=shared&amp;t=3174">Systems, gates, and rage</a>.
It seemed to go over well.
Folks occasionally told me throughout the conference that they enjoyed it.
I won&rsquo;t spoil the topic of my lightning talk (you&rsquo;ll need to watch it) but it&rsquo;s a topic that I&rsquo;d been thinking about for a few months.</p>

<p>Rodrigo gave a <a href="https://mastodon.social/@treyhunner/114519939925398070">meta lightning talk</a> as the first talk of the first day.
I gave a meta lightning talk last year in the same slot.
I hope this becomes a tradition, where the first lightning talk is a talk about someone explaining how to give a lightning talk.</p>

<h2>The keynotes</h2>

<p>I really enjoyed the keynotes this year.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/ydVmzg_SJLw?feature=shared">Cory Doctorow&rsquo;s opening keynote</a> was <a href="https://mastodon.social/@treyhunner/114519939925398070"><em>really</em> thought-provoking</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/Bglsof9b23k?feature=shared">Lynn Root&rsquo;s keynote</a> was on the importance <a href="https://mastodon.social/@treyhunner/114519939925398070">of &ldquo;play&rdquo;</a>, which is a topic I&rsquo;ve written about before to my <a href="https://pym.dev/newsletter">mailing list</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/qog-dGVhSBI?feature=shared">The Marshall project</a> keynote and <a href="https://youtu.be/3UOLpTA7pRI?feature=shared">The Carpentries</a> keynote were also great, though I missed portions of each (beginning of one and end of another) and ended up watching the full videos online after the conference.</p>

<h2>The hallway track</h2>

<p>The &ldquo;hallway track&rdquo; is the way many PyCon attendees describe <strong>the discussions that happen organically in the hallway</strong>.</p>

<p>These discussions can happen at any time, including breaks, breakfast, lunch, and even during talks. I missed at least 3 talks this year because I was having a great discussion in the hallway and time got away from me.</p>

<p>PyCon&rsquo;s venue in Pittsburgh included a great <a href="https://mastodon.social/@treyhunner/114512971414412295">rooftop</a> so the <strong>rooftop track</strong> / <strong>garden track</strong> was a lovely spin in the hallway track this year.</p>

<h2>The open spaces</h2>

<p>The open spaces are a very important part of PyCon for me.</p>

<p>Like the hallway track, the open spaces are mostly (usually) about having a conversation.
Unlike the hallway track, the open spaces have a <strong>set topic</strong>.</p>

<p>I attended open spaces (and <a href="https://mastodon.social/@treyhunner/114526876252905533">ran my own</a>):</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Education and Outreach Working Group Open Space</strong>: I&rsquo;m part of this newly revived work group and we held this to hear topics that community members are interested in seeing the PSF focus on more deliberately</li>
<li><strong>t-strings: Let&rsquo;s build powerful templating together</strong>: I am interested in the new t-string feature in Python 3.14 and wanted to listen to this conversation (I contributed <em>a little bit</em> too)</li>
<li><strong>Computer Assisted Reporting and Investigative journalism</strong>: I was curious to hear this conversation, which included journalists, government employees who respond to information requests, and many others</li>
<li><strong>Python Skill-Building</strong>: I ran this open space on the roof during lunch time to chat about different Python skill-building services, including my own (<a href="https://pym.dev">Python Morsels</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Ask a Friendly Meat-Loving Vegan</strong>: I also ran this open space, inspired by a conversation I had the night before in a hotel lobby about animal farming, veganism, nutrition, and other related topics I&rsquo;ve thought/read a lot about</li>
</ul>


<p>I enjoyed meeting folks with similar interests and having fun and productive conversations (or at least listening to interesting conversations) in those open spaces.</p>

<h2>Dinners, games, and hotel lobby conversations</h2>

<p>I ate at Bae Bae&rsquo;s, Rosewater Grill, and APTEKA during the conference.
I also ate at Condado&rsquo;s at least 3 nights.</p>

<p>APTEKA was a fun trek for <a href="https://mastodon.social/@pythonbynight@fosstodon.org/114525581821316666">vegan PierogiCon</a> with mostly non-vegan folks.
I&rsquo;m sure the pierogis weren&rsquo;t authentic, but we all loved the food.</p>

<p>After dinner every night I went to the Westin lobby and either played <a href="https://treyhunner.com/2015/06/cabo-card-game/">the Cabo card game</a> or chatted with folks (<a href="https://mastodon.social/@treyhunner/114509076754402356">1</a>, <a href="https://mastodon.social/@treyhunner/114514682814457694">2</a>, <a href="https://mastodon.social/@treyhunner/114525878624139679">3</a>).</p>

<h2>On missing talks</h2>

<p>The keynotes and lightning talks are usually my favorite parts of PyCon.
I tried to watch as many live keynotes and lightning talk sessions as I could this year.
The morning lightning talks were hard to make it to because I kept sleeping in late enough that I missed most of them.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I watched <em>very few</em> live talks.
I missed talks due to sleeping in, attending open spaces, visiting booths in the exhibit hall, getting lost in conversations in the hallway, and mid-day taking naps (in my hotel room, not during talks!).</p>

<p>Hynek has <a href="https://hynek.me/articles/hallway-track/">written about the downside of the hallway track and the importance of attending talks</a>.
I sympathize with Hynek&rsquo;s argument that the hallway track is a trade off and there are downsides to missing talks, for both attendees and speakers.
I am grateful that folks give talks and I want to support folks who do give talks, and yet, I often find myself attending few talks.</p>

<p>Ironically, the one talk I ended up taking a nap through (again, in my hotel room, not <em>in the talk</em>) was Hynek&rsquo;s.
My brain was fried by the time of his talk and I&rsquo;m glad I was able to watch it online the week after PyCon.
He apparently had a completely packed room as it was!</p>

<p>I did make sure to show up to a talk by a conference friend who I wanted to support (Michael Dahlberg&rsquo;s <a href="https://youtu.be/LseCKvrp6og?feature=shared">talk on honeybee swarms</a>).
I have also binge-watched a dozen or so talks online that I had planned to attend but missed during PyCon.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@PyConUS/videos">watch all talks online now</a> (at least I <em>think</em> they&rsquo;re all up now?).</p>

<h2>Attend a Python event</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to PyCon coming to Long Beach next year.
I&rsquo;m in San Diego and it will be nice to <em>not fly</em> to a PyCon for once!</p>

<p>I highly recommend attending local Python meetups, attending regional Python conferences, and/or attending PyCon US.
Most in-person Python community events are <em>pretty lovely</em>.
The Python community generally goes out of its way to be more welcoming than most tech events.</p>

<p>See you in Long Beach!</p>

<p>Python 3.13 is the newest major release of the Python programming 
language, and it contains many new features and optimizations compared 
to Python 3.12. 3.13.5 is the fifth maintenance release of 3.13.</p>
<p>3.13.5 is an expedited release to fix a couple of significant issues with the 3.13.4 release:</p>
<ul><li><a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/135151">gh-135151</a>: Building extension modules on Windows for the regular (non-free-threaded) build failed.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/135171">gh-135171</a>: Generator expressions stopped raising <code>TypeError</code> (when iterating over non-iterable objects) at creation time, delaying it to first use.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/135326">gh-135326</a>: Passing int-like objects (like <code>numpy.int64</code>) to <code>random.getrandbits()</code> failed, when it worked before.</li></ul>
<p>Several other bug fixes (which would otherwise have waited until the 
next release) are also included. Special thanks to everyone who worked 
hard the last couple of days to fix these issues as quickly as possible.</p>

            If you're looking to leverage the insane power of modern GPUs for data science and ML, you might think you'll need to use some low-level programming language such as C++. But the folks over at NVIDIA have been hard at work building Python SDKs which provide nearly native level of performance when doing Pythonic GPU programming. Bryce Adelstein Lelbach is here to tell us about programming your GPU in pure Python.

            If you have been coding with Python for a while, especially if you have been using frameworks and libraries such as FastAPI and discord.py, then you have probably been using async/await or asyncio. You may have heard statements like “multithreading in Python isn’t real”, and you may also know about the famous (or infamous) GIL [&#8230;]

            If you've heard the phrase "Automate the boring things" for Python, this episode starts with that idea and takes it to another level. We have Glyph back on the podcast to talk about "Programming YOUR computer with Python." We dive into a bunch of tools and frameworks and especially spend some time on integrating with existing platform APIs (e.g. macOS's BrowserKit and Window's COM APIs) to build desktop apps in Python that make you happier and more productive. Let's dive in!

            <p>Wing Python IDE version 11 is now available.  It improves the AI assisted development UI and adds
support for Claude, Grok, Gemini, OpenAI, Perplexity, Mistral, Deepseek, Ollama, and other OpenAI API
compatible AI providers.  Wing 11 also adds package management with <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">uv</span></tt>, improves Python code analysis,
updates the UI localizations, improves diff/merge, adds easier custom key binding assignment, and
much more.</p>
<p>Most of these improvements are available only in Wing Pro.  <a class="reference" href="/downloads">Compare Products</a>
for details.</p>

<strong>IMPORTANT</strong> Be sure to <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Check</span> <span class="pre">for</span> <span class="pre">Updates</span></tt> from Wing's <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Help</span></tt> menu after installing
so that you have the latest hot fixes.</div>
<p><a class="reference" href="/downloads/wing-pro/11.0.1.0">Wing Pro 11.0.1</a></p>
<p><a class="reference" href="/downloads/wing-personal/11.0.1.0">Wing Personal 11.0.1</a></p>

<p>Wing 10 and earlier versions are not affected by installation of Wing 11 and
may be installed and used independently. However, project files for Wing 10
and earlier are converted when opened by Wing 11 and should be saved under a
new name, since Wing 11 projects cannot be opened by older versions of Wing.</p>
<h2><img src="https://wingware.com/images/wing18.png" /> New in Wing 11</h2><h3>Improved AI Assisted Development</h3><p>Wing 11 improves the user interface for AI assisted development by introducing two separate
tools <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span> <span class="pre">Coder</span></tt> and <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span> <span class="pre">Chat</span></tt>. <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span> <span class="pre">Coder</span></tt> can be used to write, redesign, or extend code
in the current editor. <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span> <span class="pre">Chat</span></tt> can be used to ask about code or iterate in creating a
design or new code without directly modifying the code in an editor.</p>
<p>Wing 11's AI assisted development features now support not just OpenAI but also Claude, Grok,
Gemini, Perplexity, Mistral, Deepseek, and any other OpenAI completions API compatible AI provider.</p>
<p>This release also improves setting up AI request context, so that both automatically and
manually selected and described context items may be paired with an AI request. AI request
contexts can now be stored, optionally so they are shared by all projects, and may be used
independently with different AI features.</p>
<p>AI requests can now also be stored in the current project or shared with all projects, and Wing
comes preconfigured with a set of commonly used requests. In addition to changing code in the
current editor, stored requests may create a new untitled file or run instead in AI Chat. Wing
11 also introduces options for changing code within an editor, including replacing code,
commenting out code, or starting a diff/merge session to either accept or reject changes.</p>
<p>Wing 11 also supports using AI to generate commit messages based on the changes being committed
to a revision control system.</p>
<p>You can now also configure multiple AI providers for easier access to different models.</p>
<p>For details see <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span> <span class="pre">Assisted</span> <span class="pre">Development</span></tt> under <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Wing</span> <span class="pre">Manual</span></tt> in Wing 11's <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Help</span></tt> menu.</p>
<h3>Package Management with uv </h3><p>Wing Pro 11 adds support for the <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">uv</span></tt> package manager in the New Project dialog and the
Packages tool.</p>
<p>For details see <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Project</span> <span class="pre">Manager</span> <span class="pre">&gt;</span> <span class="pre">Creating</span> <span class="pre">Projects</span> <span class="pre">&gt;</span> <span class="pre">Creating</span> <span class="pre">Python</span> <span class="pre">Environments</span></tt> and <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Package</span>

<h3>Improved Python Code Analysis</h3><p>Wing 11 improves code analysis of literals such as dicts and sets, parametrized type
aliases, <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">typing.Self</span></tt>, type variables on the <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">def</span></tt> or <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">class</span></tt> line that declares
them, generic classes with <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">[...]</span></tt>, and <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">__all__</span></tt> in <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">*.pyi</span></tt> files.</p>
<h3>Updated Localizations</h3><p>Wing 11 updates the German, French, and Russian localizations, and introduces a new experimental
AI-generated Spanish localization. The Spanish localization and the new AI-generated strings in the
French and Russian localizations may be accessed with the new <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">User</span> <span class="pre">Interface</span> <span class="pre">&gt;</span> <span class="pre">Include</span> <span class="pre">AI</span>
<span class="pre">Translated</span> <span class="pre">Strings</span></tt> preference.</p>
<h3>Improved diff/merge</h3><p>Wing Pro 11 adds floating buttons directly between the editors to make navigating differences
and merging easier, allows undoing previously merged changes, and does a better job managing
scratch buffers, scroll locking, and sizing of merged ranges.</p>
<p>For details see <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Difference</span> <span class="pre">and</span> <span class="pre">Merge</span></tt> under <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Wing</span> <span class="pre">Manual</span></tt> in Wing 11's <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Help</span></tt> menu.</p>
<h3>Other Minor Features and Improvements</h3><p>Wing 11 also improves the custom key binding assignment user interface, adds a <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Files</span> <span class="pre">&gt;</span>
<span class="pre">Auto-Save</span> <span class="pre">Files</span> <span class="pre">When</span> <span class="pre">Wing</span> <span class="pre">Loses</span> <span class="pre">Focus</span></tt> preference, warns immediately when opening a project with
an invalid Python Executable configuration, allows clearing recent menus, expands the set of
available special environment variables for project configuration, and makes a number of other
bug fixes and usability improvements.</p>
<h3>Changes and Incompatibilities</h3><p>Since Wing 11 replaced the <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span></tt> tool with <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span> <span class="pre">Coder</span></tt> and <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span> <span class="pre">Chat</span></tt>, and AI
configuration is completely different than in Wing 10, you will need to reconfigure your
AI integration manually in Wing 11. This is done with <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Manage</span> <span class="pre">AI</span> <span class="pre">Providers</span></tt> in the
<tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span></tt> menu. After adding the first provider configuration, Wing will set that provider as
the default. You can switch between providers with <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Switch</span> <span class="pre">to</span> <span class="pre">Provider</span></tt> in the <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span></tt> menu.</p>

<p>Pour une fois, j’écris ce billet en français. Après tout, c’est ma langue maternelle, et j’ai envie de partager ce que je fais ces derniers temps avec un peu plus de spontanéité.</p>
<p>Depuis fin avril, je suis en congé forcé. Mon contrat avec la Banque Européenne d’Investissement s’est terminé, et après deux années et demie de collaboration intense, passionnante et ultra-formante sur les sujets financiers et d’investissement, je me suis retrouvé avec… du temps.</p>
