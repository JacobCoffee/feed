            <p>This is an interesting time for coverage.py: I&#8217;m trying to make use of new
facilities in Python to drastically reduce the execution-time overhead, but it&#8217;s
raising tricky questions about how coverage should work.</p><p>The current situation is a bit involved.  I&#8217;ll try to explain, but this will
get long, with a few sections.  Come talk in <a href="https://discord.gg/RBw567RyWc" rel="external noopener">Discord</a>
about anything here, or anything about coverage at all.</p><ul><li><a href="#h_how_coverage_works_today">How coverage works today</a></li><li><a href="#h_slipcover">SlipCover</a></li><li><a href="#h_python_312_sysmonitoring">Python 3.12: sys.monitoring</a></li><li><a href="#h_using_lines_for_branches">Using lines for branches</a></li><li><a href="#h_problems">Problems</a></li><li><a href="#h_where_are_we">Where are we?</a></li></ul><h1 id="h_how_coverage_works_today">How coverage works today<a class="headerlink" href="#h_how_coverage_works_today"></a></h1><p>Much of this is discussed in <a href="https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/howitworks.html" rel="external noopener">How coverage.py
works</a>, but I&#8217;ll give a quick overview here to set the stage for the rest of
this post.</p><h2 id="h_trace_function">Trace function<a class="headerlink" href="#h_trace_function"></a></h2><p>Coverage knows what code is executed because it registers a
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.settrace" rel="external noopener">trace function</a> which gets called for each line of
Python execution.  This is the source of the overhead: calling a function is
expensive.  Worse, for statement coverage, we only need one bit of information
for each line: was it ever executed?  But the trace function will be invoked for
every execution of the line, taking time but giving us no new information.</p><h2 id="h_arcs">Arcs<a class="headerlink" href="#h_arcs"></a></h2><p>The other thing to know about how coverage works today is arcs.  Coverage
measures branch coverage by tracking the previous line that was executed, then
the trace function can record an arc: the previous line number and the current
line number as a pair.  Taken all together, these arcs show how execution has
moved through the code.</p><p>Most arcs are uninteresting. Consider this simple program:</p><blockquote class="code"><pre class="python"><span class="linenos">1</span><span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;Hello&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<br /><span class="linenos">2</span><span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;world&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<br /><span class="linenos">3</span><span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;bye&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<br /></pre></blockquote><p>This will result in arcs (1, 2) and (2, 3).  Those tell us that lines 1, 2,
and 3 were all executed, but nothing more interesting.  Lots of arcs are this
kind of straight-line information.</p><p>But when there are choices in the execution path, arcs tell us about branches
taken:</p><blockquote class="code"><pre class="python"><span class="linenos">1</span><span class="n">a</span>&#xa0;<span class="o">=</span>&#xa0;<span class="mi">1</span>
<br /><span class="linenos">2</span><span class="k">if</span>&#xa0;<span class="n">a</span>&#xa0;<span class="o">==</span>&#xa0;<span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">:</span>
<br /><span class="linenos">3</span>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;<span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;a&#xa0;is&#xa0;one!&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<br /><span class="linenos">4</span><span class="k">else</span><span class="p">:</span>
<br /><span class="linenos">5</span>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;<span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;a&#xa0;isn't&#xa0;one!&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<br /><span class="linenos">6</span><span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;Done&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<br /></pre></blockquote><p>Now we&#8217;ll collect these arcs during execution: (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 6).  When
coverage.py analyzes the code, it will determine that there were two possible
arcs that didn&#8217;t happen: (2, 5) and (5, 6).</p><p>The set of all possible arcs is used to determine where the branches are. A
branch is a line that has more than one possible arc leaving it.  In this case,
the possible arcs include (2, 3) and (2, 5), so line 2 is a branch, and only one
of the possible arcs happened, so line 2 is marked as a partial branch.</p><h1 id="h_slipcover">SlipCover<a class="headerlink" href="#h_slipcover"></a></h1><p><a href="https://github.com/plasma-umass/slipcover" rel="external noopener">SlipCover</a> is a completely different implementation
of a coverage measurement tool, focused on minimal execution overhead. They&#8217;ve
accomplished this in a few clever ways, primarily by instrumenting the code to
directly announce what is happening rather than using a trace function.
Synthetic bytecode or source lines are inserted into your code to
record data during execution without using a trace function.</p><p>SlipCover&#8217;s author (Juan Altmayer Pizzorno) and I have been talking for years
about how SlipCover and coverage.py each work, with the ultimate goal to
incorporate SlipCover-like techniques into coverage.py.  SlipCover is an
academic project, so was never meant to be widely used and maintained
long-term.</p><p>One of the ways that SlipCover reduces overhead is to remove instrumentation
once it has served its purpose.  After a line has been marked as executed, there
is no need to keep that line&#8217;s inserted bytecode.  The extra tracking code can
be removed to avoid its execution overhead.</p><p>Instrumenting and un-instrumenting code is complex.  With Python 3.12, we
might be able to get the best aspects of instrumented code without having to
jump through complicated hoops.</p><h1 id="h_python_312_sysmonitoring">Python 3.12: sys.monitoring<a class="headerlink" href="#h_python_312_sysmonitoring"></a></h1><p>Python 3.12 introduced a new way for Python to track execution.  The
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.monitoring.html" rel="external noopener">sys.monitoring</a> feature lets you register for events when
lines are executed.  This is similar to a classic trace function, but the
crucial difference is you can disable the event line-by-line.  Once a line has
reported its execution to coverage.py, that line&#8217;s event can be disabled, and
the line will run at full speed in the future without the overhead of reporting
to coverage. Other lines in the same file will still report their events, and
they can each be disabled once they have fired once.  This gives us low overhead
because lines mostly run at full speed.</p><p>Coverage.py has supported line coverage in 3.12
<a href="https://nedbatchelder.com/blog/202312/coveragepy_with_sysmonitoring.html">since 7.4.0</a> with only 5%
overhead or so.</p><p>Unfortunately, branch coverage is a different story.  sys.monitoring has
branch events, but they are disabled based only on the &#8220;from&#8221; line, not on the
&#8220;from/to&#8221; pair.  In our example above, line 2 could branch to 3 or to 5.  When
sys.monitoring tells us line 2 branched to 3, we have to keep the event enabled
until we get an event announcing line 2 branching to line 5.  This means we
continue to suffer event overhead during execution of the 2-to-3 branch, plus
we have to do our own bookkeeping to recognize when both branch destinations
have been seen before we can disable the event.</p><p>As a result, branch coverage doesn&#8217;t get the same advantages from
sys.monitoring as statement coverage.</p><p>I&#8217;ve been talking to the core Python devs about changing how sys.monitoring
works for branches. But even if we come to a workable design, because of
Python&#8217;s yearly release cycle it wouldn&#8217;t be available until 3.14 in October
2025 at the earliest.</p><h1 id="h_using_lines_for_branches">Using lines for branches<a class="headerlink" href="#h_using_lines_for_branches"></a></h1><p>In SlipCover, Juan came up with an interesting approach to use sys.monitoring
line events for measuring branch coverage.  SlipCover already had a few ways of
instrumenting code, rewriting the code during import to add
statements that report execution data.  The new idea was to add lines at the
destinations of branches.  The lines don&#8217;t have to do anything. If
sys.monitoring reports that the line was executed, then it must mean that the
branch to that line happened.</p><p>As an example, our code from above would be rewritten to look something
like this:</p><blockquote class="code"><pre class="python"><span class="n">a</span>&#xa0;<span class="o">=</span>&#xa0;<span class="mi">1</span>
<br /><span class="k">if</span>&#xa0;<span class="n">a</span>&#xa0;<span class="o">==</span>&#xa0;<span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">:</span>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;<span class="c1">#&#xa0;line&#xa0;2</span>
<br />&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;<span class="n">NO</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">OP</span>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;<span class="c1">#&#xa0;line&#xa0;A,&#xa0;marked&#xa0;as&#xa0;2-&gt;3</span>
<br />&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;<span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;a&#xa0;is&#xa0;one!&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;<span class="c1">#&#xa0;line&#xa0;3</span>
<br /><span class="k">else</span><span class="p">:</span>
<br />&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;<span class="n">NO</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">OP</span>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;<span class="c1">#&#xa0;line&#xa0;B,&#xa0;marked&#xa0;as&#xa0;2-&gt;5</span>
<br />&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;<span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;a&#xa0;isn't&#xa0;one!&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;<span class="c1">#&#xa0;line&#xa0;5</span>
<br /><span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;Done&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<br /></pre></blockquote><p>If sys.monitoring reports that line A was executed, we can record a branch
from 2 to 3 and disable the event for line A.  This reduces the overhead and
still lets us later get an event for line B when line 2 branches to line 5.</p><p>This seems to give us the best of all the approaches: events can be disabled
for each choice from a branch independently, and the inserted lines can be as
minimal as possible.</p><h1 id="h_problems">Problems<a class="headerlink" href="#h_problems"></a></h1><p>There are a few problems with adapting this clever approach to
coverage.py.</p><h2 id="h_moving_away_from_arcs">Moving away from arcs<a class="headerlink" href="#h_moving_away_from_arcs"></a></h2><p>This technique changes the data we collect during execution.  We no longer
get a (1, 2) arc, for example.  Overall, that&#8217;s fine because that arc isn&#8217;t
involved in computing branches anyway.  But arcs are used as intermediate data
throughout coverage.py, including its extensive test suite.  How can we move to
arc-less measurement on 3.12+ without refactoring many tests and while still
supporting Pythons older than 3.12?</p><p>I&#8217;ve gotten a start on adapting some test helpers to avoid having to change
the tests, so this might not be a big blocker.</p><h2 id="h_is_every_multiarc_a_branch">Is every multi-arc a branch?<a class="headerlink" href="#h_is_every_multiarc_a_branch"></a></h2><p>Another problem is how coverage.py determines branches.  As I mentioned
above, coverage.py statically analyzes code to determine all possible arcs.  Any
line that could arc to more than one next line is considered a branch.  This
works great for classic branches like if statements.  But what about this
code?</p><blockquote class="code"><pre class="python"><span class="linenos">1</span><span class="k">def</span>&#xa0;<span class="nf">func</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">):</span>
<br /><span class="linenos">2</span>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;<span class="k">try</span><span class="p">:</span>
<br /><span class="linenos">3</span>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;<span class="k">if</span>&#xa0;<span class="n">x</span>&#xa0;<span class="o">==</span>&#xa0;<span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">:</span>
<br /><span class="linenos">4</span>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;<span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;early&#xa0;return&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<br /><span class="linenos">5</span>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;<span class="k">return</span>
<br /><span class="linenos">6</span>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;<span class="k">finally</span><span class="p">:</span>
<br /><span class="linenos">7</span>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;<span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;finally&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<br /><span class="linenos">8</span>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;<span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;finished&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<br /></pre></blockquote><p>If you look at line 7, there are two places it could go next.  If x is 10,
line 7 will return from the function because of the return on line 5.  If x is
not 10, then line 7 will be followed by line 8.  Coverage.py&#8217;s static analysis
understands these possibilities and includes both (7, return) and (7, 8) in the
possible arcs, so it considers line 7 a branch.  But is it?  The conditional
here is really on line 3, which is already considered a branch.</p><p>I mention this as a problem here because the clever NO-OP rewriting scheme
depends on being able to insert a line at a destination that clearly indicates
where the branch started from.  In this finally clause, where would we put the
NO-OP line for the return?  The rewriting scheme breaks down if the same
destination can be reached from different starting points.</p><p>But maybe those cases are exactly the ones that shouldn&#8217;t be considered
branches in the first place?</p><h1 id="h_where_are_we">Where are we?<a class="headerlink" href="#h_where_are_we"></a></h1><p>I&#8217;ve been hacking on this in a <a href="https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/tree/nedbat/sysmon-fake-lines-for-branches" rel="external noopener">branch in the coveragepy
repo</a>.  It&#8217;s a complete mess with print-debugging throughout just to see
where this idea could lead.</p><p>For measuring performance, we have a cobbled-together benchmark tool in the
<a href="https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/tree/master/benchmark" rel="external noopener">benchmark directory of the repo</a>. I could use help
making it more repeatable and useful if you are interested.</p><p>I&#8217;m looking for thoughts about how to resolve some of these issues, and how
to push forward on a faster coverage.py.  There&#8217;s now a
<a href="https://discord.gg/RBw567RyWc" rel="external noopener">#coverage-py channel</a> in the Python Discord where I&#8217;d
welcome feedback or ideas about any of this, or anything to do with
coverage.py.</p>

<p>Let's talk about some vulnerability data infrastructure for the Python Software Foundation (PSF).
In the recent past, most of the vulnerability data processes were manual. This worked okay because the PSF processes a low double-digit number of vulnerabilities each year (2023 saw <a href="https://osv.dev/list?ecosystem=&amp;q=PSF">12 published vulnerabilities</a>).</p>

<p>However, almost all of this manual processing was being done by me as full-time staff. Imagining this work being done by either someone else
on staff or a volunteer isn't great, because it's a non-zero amount of extra work. <em>Automation to the rescue!</em></p>

<h2>How the vulnerability data flows</h2>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-6">
<p>The PSF uses the <a href="https://www.cve.org/">CVE database</a> as its “source of truth” for vulnerability data <a href="https://github.com/psf/advisory-database/blob/main/tools/import-from-cve.py">which then gets imported</a> into our <a href="https://github.com/psf/advisory-database">Open Source Vulnerability (OSV) database</a> by translating CVE records into OSV records.</p>

<p>We manually update CVE information in a program called <a href="https://vulnogram.github.io/">Vulnogram</a>
which provides a helpful UI for CVE services.</p>

<p>So what is the minimum amount of information we need to manually create to automatically generate the rest?
This is the current list of data the PSF CVE Numbering Authority team creates manually:</p>

<ul>
<li>Advisory text and description</li>
<li>CVE reference to the advisory</li>
<li>GitHub issue (as a CVE reference)</li>
</ul>

<p>Advisories are sent to the <a href="https://mail.python.org/mailman3/lists/security-announce.python.org/">security-announce@python.org mailing list</a>
and then the description is reused as the CVE record's description. The linkages between a GitHub pull request and a GitHub issue is maintained by <a href="https://github.com/python/bedevere">Bedevere</a>
which automatically updates metadata as new pull requests are opened for an issue.</p>

<p>From this information we can use <a href="https://github.com/psf/advisory-database/blob/main/tools/import-from-cve.py">scripts</a> to generate the rest in two stages:</p>

<ul>
<li>CVE affected versions and references are populated by finding git tags that contain git commits.</li>
<li>All OSV record information is generated from CVE records. New OSV records are <a href="https://github.com/psf/advisory-database/commit/4859e8393ddeffac8c6a7d5ef3206e91b8e0bbe7">automatically assigned their IDs</a> by OSV tooling.
The <a href="https://osv.dev">central OSV database</a> calculates affected git tags on our behalf.</li>
</ul>

<p>The PSRT publishes advisories and patches once they're available in the latest CPython versions. For low-severity vulnerabilities there typically isn't an <em>immediate</em> release of <a href="https://devguide.python.org/versions/#supported-versions">all bugfix and security branches</a> (ie 3.12, 3.11, 3.10, 3.9, etc).
This means that many vulnerability records will be need to be <em>updated over time</em> as fixes are merged and released into other CPython versions
so these scripts run periodically to avoid tracking these updates manually.</p>

            I have a special episode for you this time around. We're coming to you live from PyCon 2024. I had the chance to sit down with some amazing people from the data science side of things: Jodie Burchell, Maria Jose Molina-Contreras, and Jessica Greene. We cover a whole set of recent topics from a data science perspective. Though we did have to cut the conversation a bit short as they were coming from and go to talks they were all giving but it was still a pretty deep conversation.

<div class="article-meta">

</div>

<p>OAuth is often employed in processes requiring permissions to be granted to frontend applications and end users.
Yet, what we typically need in API systems integrations is a way to secure connections between the integration
middleware and backend systems without a need for any ongoing human interactions.</p>
<p>OAuth can be a good choice for that scenario and this article shows how it can be achieved in Python, with backend
systems using REST and HL7 FHIR.</p>
<h2 id="what-we-would-like-to-have">What we would like to have</h2>
<p>Let's say we have a typical integration scenario as in the diagram below:</p>
<p><img src="https://upcdn.io/kW15bqq/raw/root/static/blog/images/3.2-oauth/oauth-rest-hl7-api-architecture.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>External systems and applications invoke the interoperability layer (Zato) which is expected to further invoke a few
  backend systems, e.g. a REST and HL7 FHIR one so as to return a combined result of backend API invocations. It does not
  matter what technology the client systems use, i.e. whether they are REST ones or not.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The interoperability layer needs to identify itself with the backend systems before it is allowed to invoke them - they
  need to make sure that it really is Zato and that it accesses only the resources allowed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An OAuth server issues time-based access tokens, which are simple strings, like web browser session cookies, confirming that such and such
  bearer of the said token is allowed to make such and such requests. Note that the tokens have an explicit expiration time,
  e.g. they will become invalid after one hour. Also observe that Zato stores the tokens as-is, they are genuinely opaque
  strings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a client system invokes the interoperability layer, the layer will obtain a token from the OAuth server and keep it in an internal cache.
  Next, Zato will invoke the backend systems, bearing the token among other HTTP headers. Each invoked backend system will extract the token
  from the incoming request and validate it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>How the validation looks like in practices is something that Zato will not be aware of because it treats the token as an opaque string
  but, in practice, if the token is self-contained (e.g. JWT data) the system may validate it on its own, and if it is not self-contained,
  the system may invoke an introspection endpoint on the OAuth server to validate the access token from Zato.</p>
<p>Once the validation succeeds, the backend system will reply with the business data and the interoperability layer will combine
  the results for the calling application's benefit.</p>
<p>In subsequent requests, the same access token will be reused by Zato with the same flow of messages as previously. However,
  if the cached token expires, Zato will request a new one from the OAuth server - this will be transparent to the calling application -
  and the flow will resume.</p>
<p>In OAuth terminology, what is described above has specific names, the overall flow of messages between Zato and the OAuth server is
called a "Client Credential Flow" and Zato is then considered a "client" from the OAuth server's perspective.</p>
<h2 id="configuring-oauth">Configuring OAuth</h2>
<p>First, we need to create an OAuth security definition that contains the OAuth server's connection details. In this case,
the server is <a href="https://www.okta.com/">Okta</a>. Note the scopes field - it is a list of permissions ("scopes") that Zato will be able to make use of.</p>
<p>What exactly the list of scopes should look like is something to be coordinated with the people who are responsible
for the configuration of the OAuth server. If it is you personally, simply ensure that what is in the the OAuth server and in Zato is in sync.</p>

<h2 id="calling-rest">Calling REST</h2>
<p>To invoke REST services, fill out a form as below, pointing the "Security" field to the newly created OAuth definition.
This suffices for Zato to understand when and how to obtain new tokens from the underlying OAuth server.</p>

<img src="https://upcdn.io/kW15bqq/raw/root/static/blog/images/3.2-oauth/rest-form.png" /></p>
<p>Here is sample code to invoke a backend REST system - note that we merely refer to a connection by its name, without having
to think about security at all. It is Zato that knows how to get and use OAuth tokens as required.</p>

<h2 id="what-about-the-api-clients">What about the API clients?</h2>
<p>One aspect omitted above are the initial API clients - this is on purpose. How they invoke Zato, using what protocols,
with what security mechanisms, and how to build responses based on their input data, this is completely independent of how
Zato uses OAuth in its own communication with backend systems.</p>
<p>All of these aspects can and will be independent in practice,
e.g. clients will use Basic Auth rather than OAuth. Or perhaps the clients will use AMQP, Odoo, SAP, or IBM MQ, without any HTTP,
or maybe there will be no explicit API invocations and what we call "clients" will be actually CSV files in a shared
directory that your services will be scheduled to periodically pick up. Yet, once more, regardless of what makes the input data
available, the backend OAuth mechanism will work independently of it all.

Pablo, Łukasz, and Lysandros all were at the Language Summit 2024 to present about this new feature coming to Python.<br /></p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Why does Python need a new interpreter?</h3><p style="text-align: left;">Python already has an interactive interpreter, so why do we need a new one? Lysandros explained that the existing interpreter is "deeply tangled" to Python's tokenizer which means adding new features or making changes is extremely difficult.</p><p style="text-align: left;"></p><p></p><p style="text-align: left;">To lend further color to this point, Lysandros dug into how the tokenizer had changed since Python was first developed. Lysandros noted that "for the first 12 years [of Python], Guido was the only one who touched the tokenizer" and only later after the parser was replaced did anyone else meaningfully contribute to the tokenizer.</p><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgN0vlG40dCudDiNJmJkmJie-v5L2tj14bf56BZhVh5Y5FgoXstLPTRJGizg-HUNSiTT-y5PdbDc8SH2xxl6PLptEeMLmZp-rtaJOWj1MXblEoAnZNsrOecNMOItPrG766TSY4TWVkMak2geSMt0o8wwHdiu1ffVrVGYdamclMh2tFkdeRIRg/s1195/Screenshot%20from%202024-05-29%2014-23-55.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="190" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgN0vlG40dCudDiNJmJkmJie-v5L2tj14bf56BZhVh5Y5FgoXstLPTRJGizg-HUNSiTT-y5PdbDc8SH2xxl6PLptEeMLmZp-rtaJOWj1MXblEoAnZNsrOecNMOItPrG766TSY4TWVkMak2geSMt0o8wwHdiu1ffVrVGYdamclMh2tFkdeRIRg/s320/Screenshot%20from%202024-05-29%2014-23-55.png" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Terse example code for Python's tokenizer<br /></td></tr></tbody></table><p style="text-align: left;">Meanwhile, there are other REPLs for Python that "have many new features that [Python's] interpreter doesn't have that users have grown to expect", Lysandros explained. Some basic features that were listed as examples included lack of color support meaning no syntax highlighting, the ergonomics issues around exit versus exit(), no support for multi-line editing and buffer history, and poor ergonomics around pasting code into the interpreter.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Why PyREPL? <br /></h3><p style="text-align: left;">"We've settled on starting our solution around PyREPL", Pablo explained, "our reasoning being that maintaining terminal applications is hard. Starting from scratch would have a much higher risk for users". Pablo also noted that "most people who would interact with the REPL wouldn't test in betas", because Python pre-releases are generally used for running automated tests in continuous integration and not interactively tested manually.</p><p style="text-align: left;">Pablo explained that there are many different terminals and platforms which 
are all sources of behaviors and bugs that are hard to get right the first time. 
"[PyREPL] provided us with a solid base that we know works and we can 
start modifying". <br /></p><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjEEE9xoCPFmO1z93-3b68hgQIGUNzt-XTJucAyskU3NzK84cPoG9WkYaW6gwki9xmuqSujNZ9hzPNzzk_Qj9bAY8dUNjmZrl5C98PJpxWbuGrwbyt6mzs8eH2zooeZxbTJ2yG4mdzydMXfufk61kSRarwu2bey9Id3MH4Rw2E5MFboedhF_w/s1439/Screenshot%20from%202024-05-29%2014-58-33.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="181" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjEEE9xoCPFmO1z93-3b68hgQIGUNzt-XTJucAyskU3NzK84cPoG9WkYaW6gwki9xmuqSujNZ9hzPNzzk_Qj9bAY8dUNjmZrl5C98PJpxWbuGrwbyt6mzs8eH2zooeZxbTJ2yG4mdzydMXfufk61kSRarwu2bey9Id3MH4Rw2E5MFboedhF_w/s320/Screenshot%20from%202024-05-29%2014-58-33.png" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Tasteful modern art or bug in the REPL?<br /></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Another major contributing factor was that PyREPL is written in Python. Pablo emphasized that "now people that want to start contributing to the REPL can actually contribute because it's written in Python".<br /></p><p style="text-align: left;">Finally, Pablo pointed out that because the implementation is now partially shared between CPython and PyPy that both implementations can benefit from bug fixes to the shared parts of the codebase. Support for Chinese characters in the REPL was fixed in CPython and is being contributed back to PyPy.</p><p style="text-align: left;">Łukasz noted that adopting PyREPL wasn't a straightforward copy-paste job, there were multiple ideas in PyPy's PyREPL that don't make sense for CPython. Notably, PyPy is written to also support Python 2, so the code was simplified to only handle Python 3 code. PyREPL for PyPy also came with support for PyGame which wasn't necessary for CPython.<br /></p><p style="text-align: left;">Type hints and strict type checking using <a href="https://mypy-lang.org/">mypy</a> were also added to PyREPL, making the PyREPL module the <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/main/Lib/_pyrepl">first in the Python standard library</a> to be type-checked on pull requests. Adding type hints to the code immediately found bugs which were fixed and reported back to PyPy.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">What are the new features in 3.13?<br /></h3><p style="text-align: left;">Pablo gave a demonstration of the new features of PyREPL, including:</p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li style="text-align: left;">Colored prompts</li><li style="text-align: left;">F1 for help, F3 for bracketed paste</li><li style="text-align: left;">Multi-line editing and history</li><li style="text-align: left;">Better support for pasting blocks of code<br />&nbsp;</li></ul><p style="text-align: left;">Below are some recreated highlights from the demo. Pasting code samples into the old REPL that contain multiple 
newlines would often result in SyntaxErrors due to multiple newlines in a
 row resulting in that statement being evaluated. Multi-line editing also helps modifying code all in one place rather than having to piece a snippet together line-by-line, modifying what you want as you go:<br /></p><p style="text-align: left;"></p><p></p><p style="text-align: left;"></p><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiOmyWRdLgCGdtM4Kvz4j5A4qh6_7t-2Jei0ArpdDmvlnWupnnIgsnG-aeekdkq9_9qcKN1F7Quu-ZweP3SMEEt5Kpo-Bl6j_sqZHcTq-VDmNlqbS8uW9SJa3GlvE6VGGo8joyXaHqVH5HpFuGyBlSbVxJwn5o-gQagi-WuSFhENUahSwl0_Q/s987/try4.gif" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="382" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiOmyWRdLgCGdtM4Kvz4j5A4qh6_7t-2Jei0ArpdDmvlnWupnnIgsnG-aeekdkq9_9qcKN1F7Quu-ZweP3SMEEt5Kpo-Bl6j_sqZHcTq-VDmNlqbS8uW9SJa3GlvE6VGGo8joyXaHqVH5HpFuGyBlSbVxJwn5o-gQagi-WuSFhENUahSwl0_Q/w640-h382/try4.gif" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Demo of multi-line paste in Python 3.13</td></tr></tbody></table>&nbsp;<p></p><p style="text-align: left;">And the "exit versus exit()" paper-cut has been bothering Python users for long enough.

Windows was left out because "historically the console on Windows was way different than Unix consoles". Łukasz continued, saying that "they don't intend to support right now" offering a "yes, but..." for users asking for Windows support.</p><p style="text-align: left;">Windows has two consoles today, cmd.exe of yore and the new "Windows Terminal" which supports many of the same features as Unix consoles including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code">VT100 escape codes</a>. The team's plan is to support the new Windows Terminal, and "to use our sprints here in Pittsburgh to finish". Windows support will also require removing CPython dependencies on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curses_(programming_library)">curses</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Readline">readline</a> libraries.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">What's next for PyREPL?</h3><p style="text-align: left;">The team already has plans cooking up for what to add to the REPL in Python 3.14. Łukasz commented that "syntax highlighting is an obvious idea to tackle". Łukasz also referenced an idea from Tania Allard for accessibility improvements similar to those in <a href="https://ipython.org/">IPython</a>.</p><p style="text-align: left;">Łukasz reiterated that the goal isn't to make an "uber REPL" or "replace IPython", but instead to make a REPL that core developers can use while testing development branches (where dependencies aren't working yet).</p><p style="text-align: left;">Łukasz continued that core developers aren't the only ones that these improvements benefit: "many teachers are using straight-up Python, IDLE, or the terminal because the computers they're using don't allow them to install anything else."</p><p style="text-align: left;">Given the applause from the room during the demos, it's safe to say that this work has been received well. There were only concerns about platform support and rollout for the new REPL.</p><p style="text-align: left;">Gregory Smith informed the team that functionality that requires a "Function" key (ie F1, F2, etc) must also be supported without Function keys due to some computers lacking them, like Chromebooks. <br /></p><p style="text-align: left;">Carol Willing was concerned about releasing PyREPL without support for Windows Terminal, especially from a teaching perspective, describing that potential outcome as "painful". Carol wanted clear documentation on how to get the new REPL on Windows. "Positioning [the new REPL] for teaching without clear 
Windows instructions is a recipe for disaster".</p><p style="text-align: left;">Pablo assured that the team wants to add support for Windows Terminal in time for the first 3.13 release candidate. Pablo could not make guarantees due to a lack of Windows expertise among the three, saying "the reason I'm not saying 100% is because none of us are Windows experts. We understand what needs to be done... but we need some help."</p><p style="text-align: left;">Łukasz named Steve Dower, the Windows release expert for Python, 
who is "very motivated to help us get Windows Terminal support during sprints".&nbsp;Łukasz reiterated they're "not 100%,
but we are very motivated to get it done".</p><p style="text-align: left;">Gregory Smith shared Carol's concern and framed the problem as one of communication strategy, proposing to "not promise too much until it works completely on Windows". By Python 3.14 the flashy features like syntax highlighting would have landed and the team would have a better understanding of what's needed for Windows. The team can revise the 3.13 "What's New in Python" depending on what gets implemented in the 3.13 timeline.</p><p style="text-align: left;">Ned Deily sought to clarify what the default experience would be for users of 3.13. Pablo said that "on Windows right now you will get the [same REPL] that you got before" and "on Linux and macOS, if your terminal supports the features which most of them do, you get the enhanced experience". "What we want in the sprints is to make Windows support the new one, if we get feature parity, then [Windows] will also get the new [REPL]".</p><p style="text-align: left;">Carol also asked to document how to opt-out of the new REPL in the case 
that support wasn't added in time for 3.13 to avoid differences between educational material and what students were seeing in their terminal. Kushal Das confirmed that differences across 
platforms is a source of problems for students, saying that "if all [students] have the same experience it's much better than just improving only macOS and Linux" to avoid students feeling bad just due to their operating system.<br /></p><p style="text-align: left;">Pablo said that the opt-out mechanism was already in place with an environment variable and will discuss other opt-out mechanisms if needed for educators.</p><p style="text-align: left;">Emily Morehouse, speaking as a Steering Council member added that the Steering Council has requested an informational PEP on the new REPL. "Hearing concerns about how [the new REPL] might be rolled out... it sounds like we might need something that's more compatible and an easier rollout", leaving the final discussions to the 3.13 release manager, Thomas Wouters. Carol replied that she believes "we could do it in documentation".</p>

            <p>The Python Language Summit 2024 closed off with six lightning talks which were all submitted during the Language Summit. The talks were delivered by Petr Viktorin, David Hewitt, Emily Morehouse, Łukasz Langa, Pablo Galindo Salgado, and Yury Selivanov.</p><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Petr Viktorin: Unsupported build warning</h2><p style="text-align: left;">Do you know what happens when you build Python on an unsupported platform?</p><p style="text-align: left;">"... <i>It works!</i>" -- Thomas Wouters<br /></p><p style="text-align: left;">Petr gave a short presentation on a warning that many folks using Python (and even developing Python!) may have never seen before: the unsupported build warning. This warning appears when building on a platform that's <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0011/#support-tiers">not officially supported by CPython</a>, for example "riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu".</p><p style="text-align: left;"></p><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjvkJZG2Hef6Q1_gBbnMa8D8-2vH2pZutdxA2dwMf0ptLy5hVYWPqlqVe6p5Bo1H-E2GL3G0ocf58y89LambQpnac-4Hl6SeGBkQj-4TO6wlqkmp5DCT_fJbzSTuN-4bo3ARtbIsw-C1sDrlOdkRkdGkzoeBZwYENDfZ2JqpWOI6bK9My_H-A/s4000/20240515_163830.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="240" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjvkJZG2Hef6Q1_gBbnMa8D8-2vH2pZutdxA2dwMf0ptLy5hVYWPqlqVe6p5Bo1H-E2GL3G0ocf58y89LambQpnac-4Hl6SeGBkQj-4TO6wlqkmp5DCT_fJbzSTuN-4bo3ARtbIsw-C1sDrlOdkRkdGkzoeBZwYENDfZ2JqpWOI6bK9My_H-A/s320/20240515_163830.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">"The platform is not supported, use at your own risk"<br />(Photo credit: Hugo van Kemenade)<br /></td></tr></tbody></table>&nbsp;<p></p><p style="text-align: left;">Just because a platform isn't officially supported by CPython doesn't mean it won't work on that platform, and indeed it's likely that CPython may work fine on the platform or a subset of features may be subtly or not-so-subtly broken or unavailable.<br /></p><p style="text-align: left;">Petr wanted to get a temperature check from the group on whether this warning could be further improved or changed, such as by hiding the warning after the user had executed the test suite or showing the number of tests that had failed.<br /></p><p style="text-align: left;">The room seemed mostly uninterested in exploring this topic further and was in favor of keeping the warning as-is.<br /></p><span><a name="more"></a></span><h2 style="text-align: left;">David Hewitt: Rust in Python: panic!</h2><p style="text-align: left;">David Hewitt maintains the project PyO3 which offers Rust bindings for the Python C API. David explained that these bindings require mapping concepts in the Rust programming language to Python and the topic of today's talk is the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.panic.html">panic!</a> macro.</p><p style="text-align: left;">In Rust, the panic! macro will generate a panic, unwind the stack, and then terminate the program while providing feedback to the caller of the program. David showed that there were <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.panic.html#when-to-use-panic-vs-result">two methods of handling errors</a> in Rust programs, <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.panic.html">panic!</a> and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/index.html">Result</a>.</p><p style="text-align: left;">Python functions implemented in Rust use the <a href="https://docs.rs/pyo3/latest/pyo3/prelude/type.PyResult.html">PyResult</a> type to contain the return value or raised exception which uses the Rust Result type. But what if a Rust function panics, what should PyO3 do?</p><p style="text-align: left;">Today PyO3 raises a separate exception for panics, <a href="http://pyo3_runtime.PanicException">pyo3_runtime.PanicException</a> to be exact. This exception inherits from <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BaseException">BaseException</a>, typically reserved for exceptions that users won't want to catch like <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#KeyboardInterrupt">KeyboardInterrupt</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#SystemExit">SystemExit</a>.<br /></p><p style="text-align: left;">David has been receiving feedback from some users that the PanicException inheriting from BaseException is annoying to work with. This is because everywhere that exceptions are caught now needs to also catch PyO3's PanicException, giving the example case of logging exceptions.<br /></p><p style="text-align: left;">David wanted feedback on whether the original choice to inherit from BaseException was appropriate or if there was a better answer.</p><p style="text-align: left;">Pablo Galindo Salgado asked whether an AssertError or RuntimeError would be more appropriate. David replied that he felt that not inheriting from BaseException would "cheapen" the Rust aspect of a panic.</p><p style="text-align: left;">Guido van Rossum offered that he thinks "BaseException is the correct choice", to which there was much agreement from the room.<br /></p><p style="text-align: left;"><span></span></p><!--more--><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Emily Morehouse: Formalizing the PEP prototype process</h2><p style="text-align: left;">Python Steering Council Member and Language Summit chair, Emily Morehouse, spoke to the group about the PEP prototype process and how formalizing can better support PEP authors.<br /></p><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg_yjbMilImLmVEiUaLonsB9wIfGZfstpK-s_OPRYJWC5hi4n9kfT162S8Yzm4HSRBn238d74zKFLA8uUimuJEbxUc5Fs3K8S4EK31CTOaSfFIMbViDPdyE9YcSfDZ3mmPZDwq1E3px-LPDUgu7ciJnMbKJvmmD-htwg2Wa7z6vQ2QciDFwnA/s4000/20240515_164802.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="240" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg_yjbMilImLmVEiUaLonsB9wIfGZfstpK-s_OPRYJWC5hi4n9kfT162S8Yzm4HSRBn238d74zKFLA8uUimuJEbxUc5Fs3K8S4EK31CTOaSfFIMbViDPdyE9YcSfDZ3mmPZDwq1E3px-LPDUgu7ciJnMbKJvmmD-htwg2Wa7z6vQ2QciDFwnA/s320/20240515_164802.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">(Photo credit: Hugo van Kemenade)</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><p style="text-align: left;">Emily started off the talk stating "We all agree that we should be doing more testing and prototyping outside of CPython". She also referenced prior talks like pdb improvements and subinterpreters where this approach was recommended.</p><p style="text-align: left;">Emily noted that the Steering Council has pronounced this as a requirement for PEP authors. She acknowledged that this "can feel a bit bad as a PEP author to be put out into the dark world of figuring out how to gather feedback from the community" and how to manage and distribute a project.</p><p style="text-align: left;">Emily's proposal for improving the PEP process borrows from the <a href="https://tc39.es">TC39 process</a>, which is the process for making changes and improvements to JavaScript. The proposal would see the prototype process be made an "official optional step of the&nbsp; PEP process" which would then allow creating a separate GitHub repository within the "<a href="https://github.com/python/">python</a>" GitHub organization.</p><p style="text-align: left;">This would allow the project to house its own code, issue tracker, and packages would be distributed by the Python organization instead of on someone's personal account. Emily also suggested providing a template for the repository to handle distributions to PyPI.</p><p style="text-align: left;">Emily's theory is that PEPs would see more adoption and get more feedback if they came from an official channel. This approach provides additional support to PEP author and lets the author start gathering community feedback quicker before waiting for PEP pronouncement.</p><p style="text-align: left;">The room was in agreement for moving forward with the process improvement.</p><p style="text-align: left;">Carol Willing thought the improvement would be great but called back to pattern matching for CPython where the work was done in a feature branch of the CPython repository rather than a separate repository. Carol thought using a feature branch worked well for pattern matching and wanted to know how this process might work for future language changes.</p><p style="text-align: left;">Emily replied that the process would be case-by-case depending on the feature whether it's a branch, fork or something else. Thomas Wouters agreed, saying that this proposal appears to be specifically for projects which could be distributed on the PyPI instead of language features.<br /></p><p style="text-align: left;"><span></span></p><!--more--><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Łukasz Langa: Python for iOS, finally</h2><p style="text-align: left;">Harking back to the previous talk on mobile support for Python, Łukasz wanted to know if the Python team should have a more official presence on phone application stores like the Apple App Store (and maybe the Google Play Store, but Łukasz declined to speak on it since he is an iOS user).</p><p style="text-align: left;">Łukasz noted that there already exists today multiple applications on his phone that "are Python". These applications are useful for trying out Python code, learning Python, and writing small programs.</p><p style="text-align: left;">However Łukasz noted that by not having an official Python application on mobile meant the user experience today is sub-optimal. Some applications are publishing old versions of Python and aren't reachable when being asked to upgrade to newer versions so users can take advantage of new features. Others have suddenly changed from being free to being paid applications. Should the Python development team do something about this?<br /></p><p style="text-align: left;">The response from the room appeared positive, but acknowledged the amount of effort that creating and maintaining such an application would be.</p><p style="text-align: left;">Russell Keith-Magee, the author of BeeWare which is leading the charge to bring Python to mobile platforms, said "Sure, but I'm not building it". After much laughter from the room, Russell noted that the project is "an entirely achievable goal but not a small one".</p><p style="text-align: left;">Ned Deily, macOS release expert, agreed and offered that "implementing a terminal would get us most of the way there".<br /></p><p style="text-align: left;"><span></span></p><!--more--><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Pablo Galindo Salgado: Making asserts cooler in 3.14</h2><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi0pV2WbxQPLnzwGGNZLfuaTK0bLZTojRicPegJVn8Fqen_yxpJ6F4LEyfLAkA2tQ-8NouuVuRAWDs3C9-Pj8qv5PjWJgXUq6IX8pvPRbULMUiwo5Tr4bzTZoZi3FBqU_Y5AoESMX1_ONpx6BUYgdtnuIDVvRG-uaBl7-rh-JYDZleTp0XcUg/s4000/20240515_165425.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="240" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi0pV2WbxQPLnzwGGNZLfuaTK0bLZTojRicPegJVn8Fqen_yxpJ6F4LEyfLAkA2tQ-8NouuVuRAWDs3C9-Pj8qv5PjWJgXUq6IX8pvPRbULMUiwo5Tr4bzTZoZi3FBqU_Y5AoESMX1_ONpx6BUYgdtnuIDVvRG-uaBl7-rh-JYDZleTp0XcUg/s320/20240515_165425.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">You'll have to imagine the iconic Pablo "✨ woooooow ✨"<br />(Photo credit: Hugo van Kemenade)</td></tr></tbody></table><p style="text-align: left;">Pablo took the term "lightning talk" to heart and gave a 90 second presentation (demo included!) on his plans to improve asserts in Python in version 3.14. The problem statement was summarized as "asserts are kinda sad", after which Pablo showed how when an assert statement fails there isn't much indication about <i>why</i> the condition failed in the error. </p><p style="text-align: left;">Consider how an assertion error might look today: <br /></p><p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: courier;">Traceback (most recent call last):<br />&nbsp; </span><span style="font-family: courier;">File "main.py", line 7, in &lt;module&gt;</span><br /><span style="font-family: courier;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bar(x, y)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ~~~^^^^^^<br />&nbsp; </span><span style="font-family: courier;">File "main.py", line 3, in bar</span><br /><span style="font-family: courier;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; assert (x + 1) + z == y<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br />AssertionError</span><br /></p><p style="text-align: left;">Pretty opaque! In the above example you'll notice that we can't see the values of x, y, or z which makes evaluating what went wrong difficult.

Per-interpreter GIL allows for true multi-core parallelism, previously using threads in a Python process would only allow a single Python instruction to execute at a time due to the GIL being shared across all threads.</p><p style="text-align: left;">Being in the same process means that each subinterpreter is sharing the same memory space, and if instructions are executing truly concurrently we run into problems with that shared memory space. PEP 684 which specifies per-interpreter GIL <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0684/#memory-allocators">calls out this issue</a> and for now keeps memory allocators using global locking mechanisms.</p><p style="text-align: left;">Yury started the talk by discussing immutable data structures and their properties, the most interesting being how quickly they can be copied in memory. Deep copies are fast for immutable data structures because they are implemented as a single copy-by-reference.</p><p style="text-align: left;">An immutable mapping collection, specifically a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_array_mapped_trie">hash-array mapped trie</a> (HAMT), has already been implemented in Python for the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextvars.html">contextvars module</a>. Context variables need to be copied for <i>every new asynchronous task</i>, so being efficient is important to not impact performance of all async Python workloads.</p><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgxf-H2sUp5DAFcb-F6V_4nDi1CJwPmaaQ2bcYsJAyeR3BVQ8tkd48KSXQkgbbe8WjhPKjcQeS3apgBovebDLvuUWK8A0ghOgUy7LtKQzo3TIcfMjOsIbaLc_ZX_X6UEHfhmbi0WVKVECEHyStwVHtdC5czZ8nFoEbjffmLSdYkE0hvnaWMnw/s4000/20240515_165853.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="240" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgxf-H2sUp5DAFcb-F6V_4nDi1CJwPmaaQ2bcYsJAyeR3BVQ8tkd48KSXQkgbbe8WjhPKjcQeS3apgBovebDLvuUWK8A0ghOgUy7LtKQzo3TIcfMjOsIbaLc_ZX_X6UEHfhmbi0WVKVECEHyStwVHtdC5czZ8nFoEbjffmLSdYkE0hvnaWMnw/s320/20240515_165853.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Yury explaining how to replant a trie 🌲<br />(Photo credit: Hugo van Kemenade)</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><p style="text-align: left;">HAMTs work by transparently updating the trie structure in background of the mapping allowing for structured sharing while minimizing overhead to create new copies. </p><p style="text-align: left;">The invariant for this to work across subinterpreters is that the immutable collection in the main interpreter must not be garbage collected. Maintaining this invariant will require reliable reference counting across subinterpreters ("remote IncRef"). The proposed implementation would have every subinterpreter maintain multiple queues for tracking local and remote reference counts. </p><p style="text-align: left;">Yury explained that similar to how HAMTs provide an immutable mapping collection there is another data structure for immutable list collections which is "just another 5,000 lines of C" (which received some chuckles) and "luckily we won't be the first ones to implement this collection".</p><p style="text-align: left;">After comparing the performance of pickling mappings or using mappings with immutable data structures showed that immutable data structures were much more performant. The performance was better for immutable mappings for both small and large numbers of keys, between 6x and a "ridiculous" 150,000x faster.</p><p style="text-align: left;">"I believe these are the missing components for subinterpreters", Yury noted with many thanks to Eric Snow who has been working on subinterpreters and per-interpreter GIL for years. Yury concluded that this work is being done with a practical use-case in mind so will be completed and usable for others including CPython.</p><p style="text-align: left;">For folks looking for more on this topic, Yury also <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2024/schedule/presentation/67/">gave a talk at PyCon US 2024</a> about his work on Memhive.<br /></p>

            <p>The final talk of the main schedule of the Python Language Summit was delivered by Jason R. Coombs on using annotations for transforms. The presentation was accompanied by a <a href="https://github.com/jaraco/transformers/blob/main/Annotations%20as%20transforms.md">GitHub repository</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jaraco/transformers/blob/main/Annotations%20as%20transforms.ipynb">Jupyter notebook</a> illustrating the problem and proposed solution.</p><p>Jason is interested in a method for users to "transform their parameters in a reusable way". The motivation was to avoid imperative methods of transforming parameters to "increase reusability, composition, and separation of concerns". Jason imagined transformers which could be "packaged up in a library or used across multiple functions" and would "be applied at the scope of individual parameters".</p><p>Python already has a language feature that's <i>similar</i> to this concept with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#function-definitions">decorators</a>, which allow wrapping a function or class with another function in a syntactically concise way.</p><p>Jason noted that "return values can be handled by decorators fairly easily, so [the proposal] is more concerned with input parameters". For a decorator to affect parameters, the decorator "would have to inspect the parameters" and "entangle itself with the function signature".</p><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj8fHzQDwNx56z5HZwjnd1Ayl4pLCYhE5w36gzvc0mpEj2sMLzVi9U9Dp1XVdx_3wUAj0wtlG6quczL1nepB-lS1xMrPUfAYAlg1y7xjiNCeAZ3SlAx2kXKDUz_Bp8hki18lvXyRHIMHR1ggucHcMJaXMP_YfwXeARCo2PjsQQBGQl6E-7AvA/s1479/Screenshot%20from%202024-06-05%2017-09-59.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="145" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj8fHzQDwNx56z5HZwjnd1Ayl4pLCYhE5w36gzvc0mpEj2sMLzVi9U9Dp1XVdx_3wUAj0wtlG6quczL1nepB-lS1xMrPUfAYAlg1y7xjiNCeAZ3SlAx2kXKDUz_Bp8hki18lvXyRHIMHR1ggucHcMJaXMP_YfwXeARCo2PjsQQBGQl6E-7AvA/w400-h145/Screenshot%20from%202024-06-05%2017-09-59.png" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Diagram from Jason's presentation showing transforms being applied to individual parameters of a function.<br /></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><p>Jason's proposal would use type annotations due to type annotations already specifying the desired type, the proposal being to add behavior "this is the type I want to make this" and perform transforms. Below is some example code of the proposal:<br /><br /><span style="font-family: courier;">def transformer(val: float | None) -&gt; float:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return val if val is not None else 0<br /><br />def make_str(val: float) -&gt; str:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return str(val)<br /><br />def my_fn(<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; p1: transformer,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; p2: transformer<br />) -&gt; make_str:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return (p1 ** 2) + p2</span></p><p>Jason went on to show that <a href="https://docs.pydantic.dev">Pydantic</a> was offering something similar to his proposal by having functions called on parameters and return values using the <a href="https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/concepts/validators/">pydantic.BeforeValidator</a> class in conjunction with typing.Annotated, though this use-case "wasn't being advertised by Pydantic":</p><p><span style="font-family: courier;">from typing import Annotated<br />import pydantic<br /><br />def transformer(val: float | None) -&gt; float:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return val if val is not None else 0<br /><br />@pydantic.validate_call(validate_return=True)<br />def my_fn(<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; p1: Annotated[float, pydantic.BeforeValidator(transformer)],<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; p2: Annotated[float, pydantic.BeforeValidator(transformer)]<br />) -&gt; Annotated[str, pydantic.BeforeValidator(str)]:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return (p1 ** 2) + p2<br /></span><br /></p><p>Jason didn't like this approach though due to the verbosity, requiring to use a decorator and provide annotations, and needing an extra dependency.</p><p>Eric V. Smith asked if Jason had seen <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0712/">PEP 712</a>, which Eric is the sponsor of, that describes a "converter" mechanism for <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html">dataclass</a> fields. This mechanism was similar in that "the type you annotated something with became different to the type you passed". Eric remarked it was "pretty common thing that people want to pass in different types when they're constructing something than the internal types of the class".<br /></p><p>Jason replied that he had seen the PEP but "hadn't incorporated it into a larger strategy yet". Steering council member Barry Warsaw noted that he "didn't know what the solution is, but it is interesting... that the problems are adjacent".</p><p>There was skepticism from the room, including from typing council member Guido van Rossum, on using type annotations as the 
mechanism for transformers. Type annotations today don't affect the runtime behavior of 
the code and this proposal would be a departure from that, Guido noting "process-wise, that's going to be a difficult hurdle".</p><p>If type annotations weren't the way forwards, Jason had also considered proposing new syntax or a new language feature and wanted feedback on whether "there's viability" in that approach and if so, "[he] could explore those options".</p><p>There were questions about why decorators weren't sufficient, citing <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0318/">PEP 318</a>
 motivation section containing examples similar to the ones Jason had 
presented. Transformers could be assigned to parameters by name, passing in the transformer as a key-value parameters into the decorator like so:</p><p><span style="font-family: courier;">def transformer(val: float | None) -&gt; float:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return val if val is not None else 0<br /></span></p><p><span style="font-family: courier;">@apply(p1=transformer, p2=transformer)<br />def my_fn(<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; p1: float,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; p2: float<br />) -&gt; float:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return (p1 ** 2) + p2</span></p><p>Jason found this pattern "discouraging" and "less elegant" because the
 variable name needs to mentioned in multiple places and that he was 
"hoping for something that was more integrated into the language, to not feel like a second-class feature".</p><p>Łukasz Langa commented on the case for removing the "None" type from a union, could already be done with a <a href="https://typing.readthedocs.io/en/latest/spec/narrowing.html#typeguard">type guard</a> and drew attention to work being done to allow more complicated type guards. Łukasz was "sympathetic to conciseness, but type checkers already handle this".</p><p>Steering Council member Gregory Smith was hesitant to make any change in this area. He agreed that "as a language, we're missing something", but "wasn't sure if we've got a way forward that doesn't make the language more complicated".<br /></p>

            <p></p><p>Zac Hatfield-Dodds came to the Language Summit to present on a fundamental incompatability between the popular async programming paradigm "<a href="https://vorpus.org/blog/notes-on-structured-concurrency-or-go-statement-considered-harmful">structured concurrency</a>" and <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0525/">asynchronous generators</a>, specifically when it came to exception handling when the two were mixed together.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Structured Concurrency <br /></h3><p>Structured concurrency is becoming more popular for Python async programming like with <a href="https://trio.readthedocs.io">Trio</a> "nurseries" and in the Python standard library with the addition of <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#task-groups">asyncio.TaskGroup</a> in Python 3.11.</p><p>When using structured concurrency, active tasks can be thought of as a tree-like structure where sub-tasks of a parent task have to exit before the parent task itself can proceed past a pre-defined scope. This exit can come through all the tasks completing successfully or from an exception being raised either internally or externally (for example, in the case of a timeout on time-bounded work).</p><p>The mechanism which allows a parent task and its sub-tasks to cooperate in this way is called a "cancel 
scope" which Trio makes a <a href="https://trio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference-core.html#trio.CancelScope">top-level concept</a> but is implicitly used in 
asyncio.TaskGroup and asyncio.timeout.</p><p>Async programs that are structured with this paradigm can rely on exceptions behaving in a much more recognizable way. There's no more danger of a spawned sub-task silently swallowing an exception because all sub-tasks are guaranteed to be checked for their status before the parent task can exit.<br /></p><h3 style="text-align: left;">The problem with yields <br /></h3><p>The fundamental issue is that <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#yield-expressions">yields</a> suspend the current call frame, in effect "returning" a value, and then the generator needs to be "called" again for execution to be resumed. This suspension doesn't play well with structured concurrency because execution can't be suspended in the same call frame as a cancel scope, otherwise that scope can't process exceptions from its child tasks.</p><p><br /></p><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhWtaKiTPJWFEv1diOaZHdyHIGqG98xfoACzbLVRN_Yi7v-f789hOQDH_zEfdlGO19RGb1gCgcA__rtD46ocU7e6XrT4CjMdHSlWnosWERYTOUu5f8YJPi5mpGf0MgMMKUE0TsR7gdfmM_XBfWFQ78op7vRku1CcTkYygheYLPwEN0VNCs1iA/s4000/20240515_155647.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="240" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhWtaKiTPJWFEv1diOaZHdyHIGqG98xfoACzbLVRN_Yi7v-f789hOQDH_zEfdlGO19RGb1gCgcA__rtD46ocU7e6XrT4CjMdHSlWnosWERYTOUu5f8YJPi5mpGf0MgMMKUE0TsR7gdfmM_XBfWFQ78op7vRku1CcTkYygheYLPwEN0VNCs1iA/s320/20240515_155647.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Zac leading a "fun game of 'why is this code broken?'"<br />(Photo credit: Hugo van Kemenade)<br /></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Zac presented some innocuous looking code samples that suffered from the described issue:<br /></p><pre><span class="k" style="font-family: courier;">async</span><span style="font-family: courier;"> <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">iter_with_timeout</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">ait</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">max_time</span><span class="p">):</span>

This means that propagation of cancellation errors can't be subverted by a suspended call frame for this program.<br /></p><p>If you're still having trouble understanding the problem: you are not alone. There was a refrain of "still with me?" coming from Zac throughout this talk. I recommend looking at the <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0789/#problem-statement">problem statement</a> and <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0789/#motivating-examples">motivating examples</a> in the PEP for more information. <br /></p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Where to go from here<br /></h3><p></p><p>Zac and Nathaniel Smith have coauthored <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0789">PEP 789</a> with their proposed solution of disallowing yield statements within context managers that behave like cancel scopes. Attempting to yield within these scopes would instead raise a RuntimeError.<br /></p><p>The mechanism would be using a new function "<span style="font-family: courier;">sys.prevents_yields()</span>" which would be used by authors of async frameworks to annotate context managers which can't be suspended safely. Users of async frameworks wouldn't need to change their code unless it contained the unwanted behavior.</p><p>The language would need to support this feature by adding metadata to call frames to track whether the current frame should allow yields to occur.<br /></p><p>Mark Shannon was concerned that the solution was "lots of machinery to handle the exception being raised in the wrong place" and sought clarification that there would be overhead added to every call and return. Zac confirmed this would be the case, but that it could be done with "one integer [member on call frames] that you increment and decrement, but it would do some operation on every frame call and return".<br /></p><p>Irit Katriel asked why a "runtime error" was being used "instead of something static". Zac explained that users might define their own context managers which have a "cancel scope property" and the runtime "wouldn't know statically whether a given context manager should raise an error or not".</p><p>Łukasz Langa asked whether adding a type annotation to context managers would be sufficient to avoid adding runtime overhead. Zac responded that "there are still many users that don't use static type checking", and that "there's no intention to make it required by default". 
Łukasz was concerned that the proposal "would be contentious for runtime performance" due to the impact being "non-trivial".</p><p>Pablo Galindo Salgado wanted to explore other big ideas to avoid the performance penalty like adding new syntax or language feature, such as "with noyield" to provide a static method of avoiding the issue. Zac agreed that changing the context manager protocol could also be a solution.<br /></p><p>Guido van Rossum lamented that this was "yet another demonstration that async generators were a bridge too far. Could we have a simpler PEP that proposes to deprecate and eventually remove from the language asynchronous generators, just because they're a pain and tend to spawn more complexity".</p><p>Zac had no objections to a PEP deprecating async generators¹. Zac continued, "while static analysis is helpful in some cases, there are inevitably cases that it misses which kept biting us... until we banned all async generators in our codebase".<br /><br />¹ Editors note: after the summit <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0789/#deprecate-async-generators-entirely">an update to PEP 789</a>
 would describe how the problem doesn't exist <i>solely</i> in async generators
 and thus removal of the feature wouldn't solve the problem, either.</p>
