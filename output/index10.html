Andres is an engineer at Microsoft who noticed performance issues with SSH while contributing to the Postgres project. Andres wasn't looking for security issues, but after digging into the problem further had discovered an attempt to subvert SSH logins across multiple Linux distros.<br /></p><p>This was a social engineering attack to gain elevated access to a project, also known as an "insider threat". An account named "Jia Tan" had begun contributing to the xz-utils project soon after the original maintainer had announced on the mailing list that they were struggling with maintenance of the project. Through the use of multiple sock-puppet accounts pressuring the maintainer and over a year of high-quality contributions, eventually Jia Tan was made a release manager for the project.</p><blockquote><p>"Jia Tan may have a bigger role in the project in the future. He has been helping a lot off-list and is practically a co-maintainer already. :-)"<br /><br />— xz-utils maintainer, Lasse Collin<br /></p></blockquote><p>Over time a series of small subversive changes were made to the project all 
culminating in a tainted release artifact that put the backdoor in 
motion. Luckily for all of us, Andres discovered the attack before the 
new version was deployed more widely. <br /></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">How is Python similar to xz-utils? <br /></h2><p>Pablo Galindo Salgado, Steering Council member and the release manager for Python 3.10 and 3.11, brought this topic to the Language Summit to discuss what could be done to improve Python's security model in the wake of the xz-utils backdoor.</p><p>Pablo noted the similarities shared between CPython and xz-utils, referencing the previous Language Summit's talk on <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2023/05/the-python-language-summit-2023-burnout.html">core developer burnout</a>, the number of modules in the standard library that have one or zero maintainers, the high ratio of maintainers to source code, and the use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Autotools">autotools</a> for configuration. Autotools was used by Jia Tan as part of the backdoor, specifically to obscure the changes to tainted release artifacts.</p><p>Pablo confirmed along with many nods of agreement that indeed, CPython could be vulnerable to a contributor or core developer getting secretly malicious changes merged into the project.</p><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgR6hqUK5r9mvlzjOdP-X6ePwdm4NOTEFx6YTJ0n0N57ihR1-jFJHsQlf73JtaOot3l4ks5gncY91UIBtjIiHoMprWCUVikzJKfSB02rxkfGrD_1mPGTGsMc2UBSpwbk4v_qmx16xJdeE9idtQFrkUtfBA7WFM8F7CTVG5X4MrhaWKSGj7fXg/s1351/Screenshot%20from%202024-06-03%2008-51-34.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgR6hqUK5r9mvlzjOdP-X6ePwdm4NOTEFx6YTJ0n0N57ihR1-jFJHsQlf73JtaOot3l4ks5gncY91UIBtjIiHoMprWCUVikzJKfSB02rxkfGrD_1mPGTGsMc2UBSpwbk4v_qmx16xJdeE9idtQFrkUtfBA7WFM8F7CTVG5X4MrhaWKSGj7fXg/s320/Screenshot%20from%202024-06-03%2008-51-34.png" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">"Could this happen in CPython? Yes!" -- Pablo<br /></td></tr></tbody></table><br /><p>For multiple reasons like being able to fix bugs and single-maintainer modules, CPython doesn't require reviewers on the pull requests of core developers. This can lead to "unilateral action", meaning that a change is introduced into CPython without the review of someone besides the author. Other situations like release managers backporting fixes to other branches without review are common.<br /></p><p>There was also an emphasis on "binary files", like wheels, images, certificates, and test data that is checked into the CPython repository. Today some of this data doesn't have a known "upstream" or source where it was generated from making introspection difficult. Part of the xz-utils backdoor utilized binary test data in order to smuggle code into the release artifacts without being reviewed by other developers.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">So what can be done?</h2><p style="text-align: left;">There aren't any silver bullets when it comes to social engineering and insider threats. Barry Warsaw and Carol Willing both emphasized the importance having an 
action plan in advance for what to do if something similar to the 
xz-utils backdoor were to happen in order to promptly fix the issue and 
alert the community.</p><p style="text-align: left;">Thomas Wouters asked the group whether the xz-utils backdoor was a serious enough 
event to force a new workflow to be adopted by core developers. Thomas noted that mandatory review of all pull requests had been <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/sc-poll-should-we-require-reviews-to-merge-all-prs/29410">discussed previously</a> and wasn't adopted at the time, but also wasn't discussed as a security issue like it is today. There's been a hesitance to break peoples' workflows or make it impossible to get bugs fixed. This change would also require a cultural change to make asking for code reviews more common amongst core developers to be effective.</p><p style="text-align: left;">Carol Willing concurred, noting that almost every other project she's contributing to requires reviews for all pull requests.<br /></p><p style="text-align: left;">Guido van Rossum was less convinced that having additional review would help much for security. Guido was more concerned about who is given "commit bit" (write access) in the first place, asking for a higher bar such as whether someone had met the person in real life, at a conference, or over a video call.</p><p style="text-align: left;">Mariatta agreed with verifying identities of core developers, including requiring updates to reconfirm the identities of individuals noting that this is commonplace for employment. Mariatta noted that the contributions being done by CPython core developers is of equal or more importance than any individuals' employment.</p><p style="text-align: left;">Some doubt was thrown on verifying identities, especially via video call, as it's now not unheard of for someone being interviewed for employment over a video call to be different from the person who shows up on the first day of work.<br /></p><p style="text-align: left;">Hugo van Kemenade remarked on removing inactive core developers, noting that it's already documented in the <a href="https://devguide.python.org">CPython developer guide</a> that inactive or unreachable core developers can be removed with or without notice. There was agreement within the group that this should be done more actively to reduce the chances that unattended privileged accounts are resurrected by malicious actors.<br /></p><p style="text-align: left;">There was some discussion about removing modules from the standard library, especially modules which are not used or have no maintainers. Toshio Kuratomi cautioned that moving modules out of the standard library only pushes the problem outwards to one or more projects on PyPI. Łukasz Langa concurred on this point referencing specifically the "<a href="https://docs.python.org/3.12/library/chunk.html">chunk</a>" module removed via <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0594/#chunk">PEP 594</a> and feeling unsure whether the alternative project on PyPI should be recommended to users given the author not being reachable.</p><p style="text-align: left;">Overall it was clear there is more discussion and work to be done in this rapidly changing area.<br /></p><p></p>

Hugo noted that the publication of Python 1.0.0 (1994) and what would become the Python versioning scheme predates the publication of SemVer by at <a href="https://github.com/semver/semver.org/releases/tag/v0.1.0">around 15 years</a> (2009).<br /></p><p>The perception of Python using semantic versioning is a source of 
confusion for users who don't expect backwards incompatible changes when
 upgrading to new versions of Python. In reality almost all new feature releases of Python include backwards incompatible changes such as the removal of "dead batteries" where <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0594/">PEP 594</a> marked 19 modules for removal in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.13/whatsnew/3.13.html">Python 3.13</a>. <br /></p><p><a href="https://calver.org/">Calendar Versioning</a> (CalVer) encompasses a wide array of different versioning schemes that have one property in common: using the release date as part of a release's version. Calendar-based versions vary quite widely, but typically include a two or four digit year (YY or YYYY) and sometimes a month or day (MM and DD).</p><p>Using years in versions is quite common amongst other programming languages, operating systems like Ubuntu, and tools like Black, pip, and PyCharm.</p><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiC7NO1SkrzswpiTqFuaxDEFbLFFtk5pn9pUbwvQF3xZD8WZdio1rvmZ7C4nY07gRlW3S7GXCqrfKQeCOn9zCvaxgI1mlhVvY53Gc5CeDM_WAnon6pGiDvA-CXTPa7RmohDZhBQz-S5k6QvDZMCmYH5NAwPAxXfbovgiovLJb-MZS0gUC4-Yw/s1920/images.012.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img alt="Examples of other programming languages using calendar-based versioning like Ada, Algol, C, C++, Fortran, and JavaScript" border="0" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiC7NO1SkrzswpiTqFuaxDEFbLFFtk5pn9pUbwvQF3xZD8WZdio1rvmZ7C4nY07gRlW3S7GXCqrfKQeCOn9zCvaxgI1mlhVvY53Gc5CeDM_WAnon6pGiDvA-CXTPa7RmohDZhBQz-S5k6QvDZMCmYH5NAwPAxXfbovgiovLJb-MZS0gUC4-Yw/w400-h225/images.012.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Slide from Hugo's presentation showing programming languages using calendar-based versioning like Ada, Algol, C, C++, Fortran, and JavaScript</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Since 2019, Python has made releases according to the new yearly cadence from <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0602/">PEP 602</a>. Moving to annual releases made it possible for downstream distributors to rely on when a new Python version appears, which brings newer Python versions to users faster.<br /></p><p>Each minor release receives 5 years of security fixes. Using the release year of 2026 as an example, users could add 5 years and know they'll receive security fixes on that minor release until 2031. Figuring out this information from "3.15" in the existing versioning scheme would require another lookup, typically to the release schedule PEP.</p><p>If the year were baked into the version, one wouldn't need to see the release schedule to know when support was ending, instead one could add 5 years to the year encoded in the version (e.g. for "3.26", 26 + 5 = 31, therefore security support ends in 2031).<br /></p><p>Hugo offered multiple proposed versioning schemes, including:</p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Using the release year as minor version (3.YY.micro, "3.26.0")</li><li>Using the&nbsp;release year as major version (YY.0.micro, "26.0.0")</li><li>Using the&nbsp;release year and month as major and minor version (YY.MM.micro, "26.10.0")</li></ul><p>There were discussions about other options beyond these amongst attendees.<br /></p><p>Thomas Wouters, release manager for 3.12 and 3.13, questioned the value-add for adopting a new versioning system. Thomas noted that while the current system is confusing, changing the system in any way also adds confusion for users. Hugo responded that clarity, especially support for security fix and end-of-life dates, was the biggest motivation.</p><p>Barry Warsaw wondered if there was a way to test potential new versioning scheme ahead of time to find potential problems. Hugo referenced the <a href="https://github.com/deadsnakes">deadsnakes project</a> which builds distributions of CPython for Ubuntu. The deadsnakes project previously created a build of Python 3.9 that modified the version to be "3.10" to help discover breakages in projects assuming a single-digit minor version. Hugo also had experience using static code analysis to find other version assumptions in Python projects.</p><p>"Python 3 is a brand at this point, and we should stick to it" said&nbsp;Guido van Rossum after sharing concerns that changes to the major version would break the ecosystem more than changes to the minor version. Others voiced concerns about changing the major version "3" including in the "python3" binary and for packaging such as "abi3" tag.<br /></p><p>Carol Willing noted that many projects are relying on Python's versioning system and already have those versions "baked in" to warnings in existing releases. Hugo confirmed this is a problem, including Python itself, which had a few deprecation warnings and messages that reference future Python versions like 3.15. Hugo's plan would be to update these versions for Python, give plenty of time before the new versioning scheme took affect.</p><p>Donghee Na offered up Rust's use of "<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/edition-guide/editions/index.html">yearly editions</a>" in the branding of their releases, where the version number is completely separate from the branding of the release. Hugo was concerned that this would add another layer of confusion and would mostly repeat information already found in the release schedule.<br /></p><p>Overall the proposal to use the current year as the minor version was well-received, Hugo mentioned that he'd be <a href="https://github.com/python/peps/pull/3834">drafting up a PEP</a> for this change.</p><p>Carl Meyer cautioned against making any changes to the version scheme before 2026 in order to preserve the 3.14 "π"-thon release which received approval and laughter from the room. Sounds like whatever happens we'll get to have our pie and eat it too. 🥧<br /></p>

    <h2>Referencing the same object in multiple places</h2>
    
      
        <p>Let's point a variable <code>row</code> to a list of three zeroes:</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">row</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>Now let's make a new variable that points to a list-of-lists:</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">boat</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">row</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">row</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">row</span><span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>We now have a list of three lists, each with three zeroes in it:</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">boat</span>
<span class="go">[[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>What would happen if we look up index <code>1</code>, and then index <code>1</code> again, and change that to the number <code>1</code>?</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">boat</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">][</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>What do you think might happen?
What will <strong>change</strong> in our lists?</p>

      
        <p>We're looking up the second list, and then the second value in the second list, and assigning that value to <code>1</code>.
So we've asked to change the middle item in the middle list to the number <code>1</code>.</p>

      
        <p>That's not quite what happens though:</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">boat</span>
<span class="go">[[0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0]]</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>Instead, we changed the middle number in <em>all</em> three of our inner lists.</p>

      
        <p>Why did this happen?</p>

      
        <p>Well...</p>

            <p><i><b>EDIT MADE ON JUNE 27th, 2024: </b>A
 typographical error was discovered in the GitHub link for Change 2. The 
link in this post reflects the actual text that will be incorporated in 
the bylaws should the amendment be approved.</i></p><p>This year, as part of our annual election process, the Python Software Foundation Board is offering three bylaws changes for our Members to vote on. These changes are all centered on our membership experience: making it simpler to qualify as a Member for Python-related volunteer work, making it easier to vote, and allowing the Board more options to keep our membership safe and enforce the Code of Conduct.</p>
<p>Voting Members will be asked to vote on these items during the July Board of Directors election. If the majority of voting members vote in favor of any of the changes, those changes will be incorporated into the bylaws and go into immediate effect.</p>
<p>We're sharing these changes with you today as an opportunity to understand why these changes are being proposed, and to give you an opportunity to ask questions of the Board before you vote, either by emailing <a href="mailto:psf-elections@pyfound.org">psf-elections@pyfound.org</a> or <a href="mailto:membership-wg@pyfound.org">membership-wg@pyfound.org</a>, or by responding to <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/for-your-consideration-proposed-bylaws-changes-to-improve-our-membership-experience/55696">the thread on the PSF discussions site</a>.</p>
<p>The text of the changes are available from the following links, all of which show visual representations of additions and deletions to our canonical bylaws repository:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/python/psf-bylaws/compare/a35a6071de181adbb7a160d5d1447e7b0272359c...359cbc540f2f6bf00bc46b9dbe3e00a950612c27">Change 1: Merging Contributing and Managing member classes</a></li>

</ul>
<p>The Board has carefully considered these changes and strongly encourages all Members to vote in favor of them. The rest of this post explains the changes, and why we're putting them to our Voting Members.</p>
<h2 id="change-1-merging-contributing-and-managing-member-classes">Change 1: Merging Contributing and Managing member classes</h2>
<p>Since 2017, when we adopted our current membership model, we've had four classes of membership: <i>Supporting</i> (recognition for being a monetary donor), <i>Managing</i> (recognition for volunteer work in the PSF or in community events), <i>Contributing</i> (recognition for volunteer work on open source software), and <i>Fellow</i> (recognition of long-term service to the mission of the PSF).</p><p>For almost as long as our membership options have existed, there's been confusion about the distinction between Managing and Contributing members. Both require 5 hours a month of volunteer service, but the distinction between community work and work on software is increasingly out of step with how our community thinks about contributing.</p>
<p><b>In the future, we want community members to qualify for PSF membership by participating and giving back to the community, either through donating, through volunteer work, or in recognition of long service, without distinguishing between code contributions and non-code contributions.</b></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/python/psf-bylaws/compare/a35a6071de181adbb7a160d5d1447e7b0272359c...359cbc540f2f6bf00bc46b9dbe3e00a950612c27">With this proposed bylaws change, we would merge the Managing and Contributing membership classes.</a> All Managing Members would become Contributing Members, and we would no longer have a Managing Member class. Further, this change would explicitly allow for works of authorship (including documentation, books, or blogs) beyond software to count as volunteer work, provided those works are openly licensed.</p>
<p>We think this would significantly simplify the membership categories, reduce confusion, and make it easier for volunteers who both run events and write code to decide which membership class best applies to them.</p>
<h2 id="change-2-simplifying-the-voter-affirmation-process-by-treating-past-voting-activity-as-intent-to-continue-voting">Change 2: Simplifying the voter affirmation process by treating past voting activity as intent to continue voting</h2>
<p>Our bylaws (section 4.2) require every Member to affirm their intention to vote in an election before they can be issued a ballot. This is intended to ensure that our election reaches a quorum (i.e. one third of ballots issued are actually used to vote), and is therefore valid by our bylaws. Due to technical limitations, we only started requiring this affirmation in practice last year. Since then, we've received feedback that the affirmation process has unintentionally excluded some people who had intended to vote.</p>
<p><b>It is the Board's intention that we make it as easy as possible to vote in our elections, however, we must balance legal obligations that require us to maintain a quorum in our elections.</b></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/python/psf-bylaws/compare/a35a6071de181adbb7a160d5d1447e7b0272359c...6bac449">This bylaws change would allow us to treat any member who voted in the immediately previous year's election as having affirmed their intention to vote</a>. The Board believes that voting in a PSF election is a good indicator that a member is likely to vote again, and including them in the quorum calculation is unlikely to put our quorum at risk.</p>
<p>While there may be technical limitations to us implementing this change, the change is necessary to allow the Foundation to alter the affirmation procedure at all. It is the Board's intention that this change would be implemented for the 2025 election should the Bylaws change be accepted by the membership during the 2024 election.</p>
<h2 id="change-3-allow-for-removal-of-fellows-by-a-board-vote-in-response-to-code-of-conduct-violations-removing-the-need-for-a-vote-of-the-membership">Change 3: Allow for removal of Fellows by a Board vote in response to Code of Conduct violations, removing the need for a vote of the membership</h2>
<p>Currently PSF Fellows are awarded membership for life, as a reward for exceptional service to the mission of the Foundation. There are deliberately very few ways to remove a Fellow from the membership.</p>
<p>If a Fellow were found to have violated the Foundation's <a href="https://policies.python.org/python.org/code-of-conduct/">Code of Conduct</a> in a way that warranted termination of their membership, currently the only way to remove them would be to put their removal to a vote of all Voting Members (per section 4.15 of our Bylaws). We believe that requiring a vote of the membership to remove a Code of Conduct violator from our community would subject members of the community --- including people directly impacted by that violator's behavior --- to undue distress.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we believe there is significant legal risk that could arise from Code of Conduct violators known to the PSF using their status as a PSF Fellow to enhance their reputation. In cases where the Foundation needs to act in order to continue being able to serve the Python community effectively, we currently have no choice but to name a known Code of Conduct violator as part of a vote put to the membership.</p>
<p><b>In practice, this requirement limits our ability to effectively enforce our Code of Conduct. This is a disservice to our community.</b></p>

This change would allow the Board to act in cases where there is a clear need for a problematic community member to no longer be affiliated with the Foundation, without further perpetuating the trauma caused by that community member's actions.</p>

  <center>This critical role would not be possible without funding from the <a href="https://alpha-omega.dev">Alpha-Omega project</a>. Massive thank-you to Alpha-Omega for investing in the security of the Python ecosystem!</center>
</blockquote>

<p>This was my first PyCon US as the Security Developer-in-Residence. I accepted the offer shortly after PyCon US 2023, where Deb Nicholson
provided an exciting cliffhanger that the PSF was <a href="https://youtu.be/NZhHFDbul8g?si=NnoacwZ0orYnVGNc&amp;t=792">close to making a hiring decision</a> for the role
during the PSF update.</p>

<p>The timing of my hiring to coincide with PyCon US is quite the unique opportunity, it means I get to share all the
things we've been able to accomplish together in the past year all-together in person. This also
means I get to share the road ahead and learn from many people I don't get to see
on a day-to-day, like maintainers of projects large and small, software users at organizations and companies,
and users whose work extends beyond software like scientists and industrial control systems operators.</p>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-9">
<p>Overall I think this yearly cadence couldn't be better, I'm already looking forward
to what I'll be able to share at PyCon US 2025 back in Pittsburgh. As I've said in the past, this role wouldn't be effective
without the support of the community, so I want to thank you all for the parts you've played in me being successful.</p>

<h2>State of Python Supply Chain Security with Alpha Omega</h2>

<p><a href="https://alpha-omega.dev/">Alpha Omega</a> is a sponsor of the Python Software Foundation, specifically for my role!
Alpha Omega's goal is to "improve global software supply chain security by partnering with open source". I presented
alongside Alpha Omega's co-founder Michael Winser. The slides for our presentation are <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/sethmlarson-dev-static-assets/PyConUS2024-State-of-Python-Supply-Chain-Security.pdf">available online</a>.</p>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-6">
<p>Alpha Omega uses a two-pronged approach, and it's right there in the name: Alpha and Omega:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Alpha</strong>: Improve the security posture of the most critical projects through staffing.</li>
<li><strong>Omega</strong>: Automated security analysis, metrics, and remediation for wider range of projects.</li>
</ul>

<p>
My role is full-time staffing, so is in the "Alpha" bucket of funding.
</p>

<br /><small><i>Speaking for Alpha Omega on the state of Python supply chain security</i></small></p>
</center>
</div>

</div>

For readers of my blog, lots of the content of the presentation is review, but I went over the following accomplishments for the first year of the role:

<ul>

<p><li>Python Software Foundation as a CVE Numbering Authority (and how we helped Linux, curl, and others with a guide).</li>
<li>Joining Python Security Response Team and working on process</li>
<li>Working with Python release managers to move the release process to GitHub Actions as an isolated build environment.</li>
<li>Build reproducibility for the Python release process.</li>
<li>Software Bill-of-Materials for Python release artifacts.</li>
<li>Coordinated cross-ecosystem response to libwebp and xz-utils vulnerabilities.</li>
<li>Tons of community work: PEP reviewer, talks, blogs, and more.</li></p>

</ul>

The more interesting part for existing readers is my plans for next year. My plan is to partially shift focus, continue working
with Python core developer team of course, but to start making improvements to the wider community of projects
using Python as well:

<ul>

<p><li>Enabling Build Provenance and Software Bill-of-Materials for Python packages.</li>
<li>Adoption of security features, hardening, and best practices for Python packages.</li>
<li>Special focus on Python packaging tools and workflows.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>I finished the talk by describing the unique nature of this role as being flexible
and how that's a boon for the rapidly changing space of software supply chain security.
This role has a fairly wide scoping, which means that when things come up (like xz-utils
and novel social-engineering techniques) it's in this role's scope to think about how to
respond for the Python ecosystem.</p>

<h2>“Vuln Together”, an open space on vulnerability management</h2>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-6">
<p><em>“Got vulns? Let's talk!”</em> -- I co-hosted this open space with GitHub Security champion and CVE board member <a href="https://github.com/taladrane">Madison Oliver</a>.
This open space focused on the soft-side of vulnerability management for open source projects: people!</p>

<p>Managing vulnerabilities for open source projects is a non-trivial and effort intensive process, because maintainers need to create and publish a security policy,
accept private vulnerability reports, and then know what reporters need, request a CVE ID, know how to estimate severity
and write an advisory text, and then how to publish an advisory alongside fixed versions. Phew!</p>

</div>

<p></div></p>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-6">
<p>The open space was a forum to discuss difficulties with managing vulnerabilities, answering questions, and pointing folks at resources. We shared recommendations like how maintainers can <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/publishing-a-repository-security-advisory">easily request CVEs from GitHub</a>,
enable <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability">Private Vulnerability Reporting on GitHub</a> and <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/confidential_issues.html">Confidential Issues on GitLab</a>
to make reporting easier, and showed resources like the <a href="https://github.com/ossf/oss-vulnerability-guide/blob/main/maintainer-guide.md">Guide for Vulnerability Disclosure Process</a>
from the OpenSSF Vulnerability Disclosures working group.</p>

<h2>Language Summit discussion on CPython security</h2>

<p>My bingo space for "xz" was almost immediately filled at PyCon US when I attended the <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2024/events/language-summit/">Python Language Summit</a> as the blogger.
Release manager and core developer Pablo Galindo Salgado spoke about the Python contribution security model in "the wake of xz-utils backdoor".</p>

<p>The complete language summit blog posts are <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/">coming soon to the Python Software Foundation blog</a> (I should know, I authored them!)
so if you're interested in this topic you can stay tuned over there. I won't spoil any of the contents of the blog post here, but it was a great discussion all around.
Lots of interesting ideas and thoughts from core developers that'll help with figuring process improvements that work for CPython.</p>

<h2>Meeting all the people</h2>

<p>Mike Fiedler and I were on the stage briefly after Kate Chapman's keynote for a "<a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/sethmlarson-dev-static-assets/PSF-Meet-our-Security-Engineers.pdf">Meet the Python Software Foundation Security Engineers</a>"
segment where we went over our plans for the upcoming year and recommended folks to follow the <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/">PSF</a> and <a href="https://blog.pypi.org/">PyPI blogs</a> for future updates.</p>

<p>Of course, I got to talk to so many people, too many to name individually. I chatted with the upcoming Release Manager for CPython, Hugo van Kemenade, on some ideas to further improve the CPython
release process, specifically around signatures. I chatted with folks from specific sub-ecosystems like Jannis Leidel from Conda and Jazzband, David Lord from Flask, and Jarek Potiuk from Airflow.</p>

<p>Also I handed out stickers! I went through over a hundred, it brought me a lot of joy seeing how much folks liked the derpy snake knight design.</p>

<h2>... and beyond!</h2>

<p>PyCon US 2024 is the start of conferences this year for me.
Shortly after PyCon US it was announced that <a href="https://x.com/PyConTW/status/1793884640379335026">I will be keynoting</a> <a href="https://tw.pycon.org/2024/en-us">PyCon Taiwan</a> in September and also speaking at <a href="https://2024.allthingsopen.org/">All Things Open 2024</a> in Raleigh, North Carolina.
If you're attending either of these events get in contact with me (and I promise to bring stickers).</p>

<p>That's all for this post! 👋 If you're interested in more you can read <a href="https://sethmlarson.dev/security-developer-in-residence-report-38">the next report</a> or <a href="https://sethmlarson.dev/security-developer-in-residence-weekly-report-36">the last report</a>.</p>

It has a somewhat niche use-case, but it seems like a few people have found it useful.

<p>HL7 FHIR, pronounced "fire", is a data model and message transfer protocol designed to facilitate the exchange of information
among systems used in health care settings.</p>
<p>In such environments, a FHIR server will assume the role of a central repository of health records
with other systems integrating with it, potentially in a hub-and-spoke fashion, thus letting the FHIR server become a unified
and consistent source of data that would otherwise stay confined to a silo of each individual health information system.</p>
<p>While FHIR is the way forward, the current reality of health care systems is that much of the useful and actionable
information is distributed and scattered among many individual data sources - paper-based directories, applications or
data bases belonging to the same or different enterprises - and that directly hampers the progress towards delivering
good health care. Anyone witnessing health providers copy-and-pasting the same information from one application to another,
not having access to the already existing data, not to mention people not having an easy way to access their own data about
themselves either, can understand what the lack of interoperability looks like externally.</p>
<p>The challenges that integrators face are two-fold. On the one hand, the already existing systems, including
software as well as medical appliances, were often not, or are still not being, designed for the contemporary inter-connected world.
On the other hand, FHIR in itself is a relatively new technology which means that it is not straightforward to re-use
the existing skills and competencies.</p>
<p>Zato is an open-source platform that makes it possible to integrate systems with FHIR using Python. Specifically,
its support for FHIR enables quick on-boarding of integrators who may be new to health care interoperability,
who are coming to FHIR with previous experience or interest in web development technologies, and who need an easy way to
get started with and to navigate the complex landscape of health care integrations.</p>
<h2 id="connecting-to-fhir-servers">Connecting to FHIR servers</h2>
<p>Outgoing FHIR connections are what allows Python-based services to communicate with FHIR servers. Throughout the rest
of the chapter, the following definition will be used. It connects to a live, publicly available FHIR server.</p>
<p>Filling out the form below will suffice, there is no need for any server restarts. This principle, that restarts are not needed,
applies all throughout the platform, whenever you change any piece of configuration, it will be automatically propagated
as necessary.</p>
<ul>
<li>Name: FHIR.Sample</li>
<li>Address: <a href="https://fhir.simplifier.net/zato">https://simplifier.net/zato</a></li>
<li>Security: No security definition (we will talk about security later)</li>
<li>TLS CA Certs: Default bundle</li>

<h2 id="retrieving-data-from-fhir-servers">Retrieving data from FHIR servers</h2>
<p>In Python code, you obtain client connections to FHIR servers through <strong>self.out.hl7.fhir</strong> objects, as in the example
below which first refers to the server by its name and then looks up all the patients in the server.</p>

<p>To save information in a FHIR server, create the required resources and call .save to permanently store the data
in the server. Resources can be saved either individually (as in the example below) or as a bundle.</p>

<h2 id="learning-what-fhir-resources-to-use">Learning what FHIR resources to use</h2>
<p>The "R" in FHIR stands for "Resources" and the sample code above uses resources such a Patient or Appointment but how does
one learn what other resources exist and what they look like? In other words, how does one learn the underlying data model?</p>
<p>First, you need to get familiar with the spec itself which, in addition to textual information, offers visualizations
of the data model. For instance, here is the description of the <a href="https://hl7.org/fhir/observation.html">Observation object</a>,
including details such as all the attributes an Observation is composed of as well as their multiplicities.</p>
<p>Secondly, do spend time with FHIR servers such as <a href="https://simplifier.net">Simplifier</a>. Use Zato services to create test
resources, look them up and compare the results with what the spec says. There is no substitute for experimentation when
learning a new data model.</p>
<h2 id="fhir-security">FHIR security</h2>
<p>Outgoing FHIR connections can be secured in several ways, depending on what a given FHIR requires:</p>
<ul>
<li>With Basic Auth definitions</li>
<li>With OAuth definitions</li>
<li>With SSL/TLS. If the server is not a public one (e.g. it is in a private network with a private IP address), you may need
  to upload the server's certificate to Zato first if you plan to use SSL/TLS because, without it, the server's certificate
  may be rejected.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mllp-hl7-v2-and-v3">MLLP, HL7 v2 and v3</h2>
<p>While FHIR is what new deployments use, it is worth to add that there are still other HL7 versions frequently
seen in integrations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Version 2, using its own MLLP protocol</li>
<li>Version 3, using XML</li>
</ul>
<p>Both of them can be used in Zato services, in both directions. For instance, it is possible to both receive HL7 v2 messages
as well as to send them to external applications. It is also possible to send v2 messages using REST in addition to MLLP.</p>

I believe the bigger picture holds true that to fully utilize AI to write software, will require an entirely different approach.

But I believe the addition of the Chat window to CoPilot and an improvement in the accuracy of its models has already made a significant difference.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;">On balance I would now say that even a fluent programmer may get some benefits from its use. Given the speed of improvement it is likely that all commercial programming will use an AI assistant within a few years.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;"></span></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhGIsktBAMmEAcZ9augEGnC95rzbABtEtnOZ1he3r5HfRjjIBf1ZQJAxFWVWVMm15__rPM_LNMcMVRVt-8ds5vJrm8omCHE90WiJE2zSZXPYaXLWgJO54_4YKiNBGqx7meVFBxGbP4OsGcVZz3CM5qUlVhyF2e5IPDvUtbGs-3AAq6lxl8NrWPBQHz1SM8W" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="" height="240" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhGIsktBAMmEAcZ9augEGnC95rzbABtEtnOZ1he3r5HfRjjIBf1ZQJAxFWVWVMm15__rPM_LNMcMVRVt-8ds5vJrm8omCHE90WiJE2zSZXPYaXLWgJO54_4YKiNBGqx7meVFBxGbP4OsGcVZz3CM5qUlVhyF2e5IPDvUtbGs-3AAq6lxl8NrWPBQHz1SM8W" width="282" /></a></span></div><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;"><br />To delay the inevitable and not embed it in to your work process is like King Canute commanding the sea to retreat. There are increasing numbers of alternatives available too. However as the market leader I believe it is worth going in to slightly more depth as to the current state of play with CoPilot.</span><p></p><p></p><h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;">Github Copilot Features</span></h3><p><span style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: small;">The new Chat window within your IDE gives you a context sensitive version of Copilot ChatGPT that can act as a pair programmer and code reviewer for your work.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;"><span>If you have enabled auto-complete then you instigate that usage by writing functional comments, ie prompts then tabbing out to accept the suggestions it responds with.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">To override these prompts, you instead can use dot and get real code completion options (as long as your IDE is configured correctly). Since code completion has your whole codebase as context, it complements CoPilot reasonably well. But whilst the code completion is always correct, CoPilot is less so, probably more like 75% now compared to its initial release level of 50%</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;"><span></span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">It takes some time to improve the quality of your prompting. An effort must be made to eradicate any nuance, assumption, implication or subtlety from your English. Precise mechanical instructions are what are required. However its language model will have learnt common usage. So if you ask it to sort out your variables it will understand that you mean replace all hardcoded values in the body of your code with a set of constants defined at the top, explain that is what it thinks you mean and give you the code that does that.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">You can ask it anything about the usage of the language you are working in, how something should be coded, alternatives to that etc. So taking a pair programming approach and explaining what you are about to code and why to CoPilot chat as you go,&nbsp; can be very useful. Given rubber duck programming is useful, having an intelligent duck that can answer back ... is clearly more so.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">It excels as a learning tool, largely replacing Googling and Stack Overflow with an IDE embedded search for learning new languages. But even for a language you know well, there can be details and nuances of usage you have overlooked or changes in syntactic standards with new releases you have missed.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">You can also ask it to give your file a code review. Where it will list out a series of suggested refactors that it judges would improve it.</span></p><h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><b>Copilot Limitations</b></span></h3><p><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;">Currently however there are many limitations, understanding them, helps you know how to use CoPilot and not turn it off in frustration at its failings!&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;">The most important one is that CoPilot's context is extremely limited. There is no RAG enhancement yet, no learning from your usage. It may seem to improve with usage, but that is just you getting better at using it. It does not learn about you and your coding style as you might expect, given a dumb shopping site does that as standard.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: small;">It does not create a user context for you and populate it with your codebase. It simply grabs the content of the currently edited file and the Chat prompt text and the language version for the session as a big query.&nbsp;</span><span>The same for the auto-suggestion. But here the chat text is from the comments or doc strings on the lines preceding.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;">Posting the lot to a fixed CoPilot LLM that is some months out of date. Although apparently it has weekly updates from continuous retraining.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">This total lack of context can mean the only way you can get CoPilot to suggest what you actually want is to write very detailed prompts. It is often simpler to just cut and paste example code as comments into the file - please rewrite blah like this ... paste example. Since only if its in the file or latest Chat question will it get posted to inform the response.<br /><br />At the time of writing CoPilot is due to at least retain and learn from Chat window history to extend its context a little. But currently it only knows about the currently open file and latest Chat message. Other providers have tools that do load the whole code base, for example Cody, plus there are open source tools to post more of your code base to ChatGPT or to an open source LLM.<br /><br />As this blog post update indicates, the whole area is evolving at an extremely rapid pace.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;">The model it has for a language is fixed and dated. Less so for the core language but for example you may use a newer version of the leading 3rd party Postgres library that came out 2 years ago. But the majority of users are still on the previous one since it is still maintained. Their syntax differs. Copilot may only know the syntax for the old library because that is what it was trained with, even though a later version is being imported in the file, so is in Copilot's limited context. So any chat window or code prompts it suggests will be wrong.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;">I have yet to find it brings up anything useful that I didn't know about the code when using the code review feature, plus the suggestions can include things that are inapplicable or already applied. But I am sure it would be more useful for learning a new language.</span></p><h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;"><b>AI prompting and commenting issue</b></span></h3><p><span style="font-family: arial;">Good practise for software teams around code commenting are that you should NOT stick in functional comments that just explain what the next few lines do.&nbsp; The team are developers and they can read the code as quickly for its base functionality. Adding lots of functional commenting makes things unclear by excessive verbosity.<br />It is something that is only done for teaching people how to code in example snippets. It has no place in production code.<br /></span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">Comments should be added to give wider context, caveats, assumptions etc. So commenting is all about explaining the Why, not the How.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">Doc strings at the head of methods and packages can contain a summary of what the function does in terms of the codebase. So more functional in orientation, but as a big scale summary. So again they are a What not a How.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;"></span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">It looks like current AI assistants</span><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;may mess that up. Since they need comments that are basically as close to pseudo code as possible. Adding information about real world issues, roadmap, wider codebase, integration with other services ... ie all the Why is likely to&nbsp; confuse them and degrade the auto-complete.<br /><br />Unfortunately code comments are not AI prompts for generating code and vice versa.<br />Which suggests that you may want to write a temporary prompt as a comment to generate the code, then replace it with a proper comment once it has served its purpose.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">Or otherwise introduce a separate form of hideable prompt marked comment that make it clear what is for the AI and what is for the Human!</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">Alternatively use the chat window for code generation then paste it in.</span></p><h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;">Copilot Translation</span></h3><p><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;">Translation is an area where Copilot can be very beneficial. As a non-native English speaker you can interact with it in your own language for prompting and comments and it will handle that and translate any comments in the file to English if asked to.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;"><span>Code translation is more problematic, since the whole structure of a program and common libraries can be different. But if the code is doing some very encapsulated common process. For example just maths operations, or file operations. It can extract the comments and prompts and regenerate the code into another language for you.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;"><span>One can imagine that one day the only language anyone will need will be a very high level, succinct English-like language, eg. Python.<br />When you want to write in a verbose or low-level language. You just write the simpler prompts in a spoken language, but use Python when it is faster to communicate explicitly than spoken. Since spoken languages are so unsuited to creating machine instructions. <br />Press a button and Copilot turns the lot into verbose C or Java code with English comments.</span></span></p>

<h1>Contrarian view on cursor-based pagination.</h1>
<p><a href="https://graphql.org">GraphQL</a> documentation recommends <a href="https://graphql.org/learn/pagination/#pagination-and-edges">cursor-based pagination</a>, and it has subsequently become a popular standard.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In general, we’ve found that cursor-based pagination is the most powerful of those designed. Especially if the cursors are opaque, either offset or ID-based pagination can be implemented using cursor-based pagination (by making the cursor the offset or the ID), and using cursors gives additional flexibility if the pagination model changes in the future. As a reminder that the cursors are opaque and that their format should not be relied upon, we suggest base64 encoding them. …</p>

<p>There are several oversights with this well-intentioned advice.</p>
<section class="level2" id="cursors-and-state">
<h2 class="anchored">Cursors and state</h2>
<p>Cursors imply state, at least they used to. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cursor_(databases)">database cursor</a> is used for iterating over <em>a result set</em>. Meaning it has transactional integrity to pick up where it left off.</p>
<p><strong><em>The vast majority of GraphQL APIs are inherently stateless.</em></strong> The “cursor” is being decoded as input to a new request, and offers no guarantees. From this observation, the advice falls apart.</p>
<p>The problem with stateless pagination is inconsistency; items may shift, appear, or disappear. Which gives the client the perception of missing or duplicate items. This happens regardless of whether the pagination is offset or ID based. Arguably worse in the case of IDs, since the reference can move arbitrarily or be gone.</p>
<p>Cursors don’t solve the consistency problem; they give the client the false impression of solving the problem.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section class="level1" id="opaqueness-and-compatibility">
<h1>Opaqueness and compatibility</h1>
<p>The claim is that an opaque cursor is compatible across changes. Changed to do what exactly, would be the more relevant question.</p>
<p>Taking a step back, what is the problem being solved here? We assume there is a list of items, with an inherent ordering, and too many to return to the client with acceptable performance.</p>
<p>Given those assumptions, the first obvious step is an optional size limit. That is not in dispute; the disagreement if over the “offset”. A simple and versatile solution is a range filter over whatever field(s) is relevant to ordering. This is not even remotely controversial when the field in question has a name like <code>date</code>. In other words, “pagination” is not necessarily the problem that needs solving.</p>
<p>Range filters with a size limit are sufficient to implement pagination, and new optional filters are always backwards compatible. They also offer the flexibility of search, whereas cursors can only be used iteratively. And what if the client does not want visibility into the range filters? That is exactly what <code>offset</code> is for; offset is a range filter over an implied <code>index</code> field.</p>
<p>There is a reason why the recommendation does not offer a useful example of this supposed compatibility; there isn’t one. The advice is equivocating on the ambiguity of an <code>after: $ID</code> filter. Is the ID field relevant to the ordering?</p>
<ul>
<li>If yes, then it is just another range filter</li>
<li>If no, then it is just another placeholder for index</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no third case. There is no future secret field that relates to ordering, is relevant to the client, but somehow still opaque to the client.</p>
<p><strong><em>Stateless pagination is a combination of range filters and size limits</em></strong>. No matter what the input fields are called. A true stateful is cursor is opaque precisely because it does not represent any known field.</p>
<section class="level2" id="next-optimization">
<h2 class="anchored">Next optimization</h2>
<p>The “next” piece of advice is that the cursor implementation should indicate whether another request is worthwhile. Again, in a stateless API, the server can make no such guarantee.</p>
<p>If the server can provide a total count, by all means do so. It solves the “next” problem, and is more generally useful.</p>
<p>If it is not feasible for the server to provide a total count, how is it going to implement whether there are more items? At the data layer, it is going to stop processing at <em>N + 1</em> items instead of the requested <em>N</em>. The client could do that too. Instead of requesting the next 10, it could <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_to_eleven">go to 11</a>.</p>
<p>Better yet, why stop at the server optimizing for <em>N + 0</em>? If it knows there is just 1 more item, why not go ahead and include that last one too. <em>N + 2</em> anyone? Obsessing over the last “next” is a pointless micro-optimization, all the more so because it is irrelevant whenever the total count is not coincidentally a multiple of <em>N</em>. If <em>N</em> is arbitrary, then optimizing for a particular residue <em>mod N</em> is clearly arbitrary.</p>
</section>
<section class="level2" id="api-design">
<h2 class="anchored">API design</h2>
<p>Not only is there no good reason to blindly add opaque cursors, there is also no reason to add range filters before needed. A size limit alone solves the first order of magnitude of performance issues. If a client requests the first 10 items, then needs the next 10, actually pressure test whether it is unreasonable to request the first 20. The advantage is the client then has a consistent snapshot of the first 20 regardless of changes, which could provide a better user experience.</p>
<p>A simple strategy for pagination: start with none. Then proceed to next steps as performance warrants.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>size limit</li>
<li>range filter on known field(s)</li>
<li>offset</li>
</ol>
<p>In the unlikely event your API is stateful, you didn’t need this advice because you already had a cursor. Otherwise, cursors are an overly-complicated useless abstraction.</p>

<p>I loathe writing automated tests for performance-related exercises because they&rsquo;re <em>always</em> flaky.
How flaky depends on the exercise, what I&rsquo;m testing, and the time variability inherent in the particular Python features that a learner might use.</p>

<p>I came up with a solution for flaky tests recently, but it also makes my tests less readable.
I then came up with a tool to improve the readability, but that has its own trade-offs.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll explain what that code does, but first let&rsquo;s talk about why it&rsquo;s needed.</p>

<h2>The flaky performance tests</h2>

<p>My flaky performance tests initially looked like this:</p>

<p>The first block runs a performance test for the user&rsquo;s function on a very small list and on a slightly larger list and then asserting that the slightly larger list didn&rsquo;t take <em>too</em> much longer to run.
The next two blocks run the same code on even larger lists and make further assertions about the relative times that the code took to run.</p>

<p>This roughly approximates the <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/time-complexities/">time complexity</a> of this code.</p>

<h2>Running performance checks in a loop</h2>

<p>These performance checks need to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Predictably fail for inefficient solutions</li>
<li>Predictably pass for efficient solutions</li>
<li>Run <em>fast</em> (within just a few seconds) even when the code is inefficient</li>
<li>Avoid the use of <code>threading</code> because they&rsquo;ll be running on WebAssembly in the browser</li>
<li>Run consistently on pretty much any computer</li>
</ol>


<p>These 5 requirements together have caused me countless headaches.
I get the tests passing well, but they don&rsquo;t always fail when they should.
I get the tests failing and passing when they should, but then they&rsquo;re too slow.
And so on&hellip;</p>

<p>Notice the <code>n</code> and <code>m</code> factors in the above assertions:</p>

<figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="python"><span class="line"><span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">assertLess</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">small_time</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">micro_time</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">n</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">m</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If <code>n</code> and <code>m</code> are too big, we&rsquo;ll get false positives (tests passing when they should fail).
If <code>n</code> and <code>m</code> are too small, we&rsquo;ll get false negatives (tests failing when they should pass).</p>

<p>To avoid both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors">Type I and Type II errors</a>, I decided to keep <code>n</code> and <code>m</code> small but attempt the assertion block multiple times.</p>

<p>The <code>for</code> loop runs the code multiple times, the <code>break</code> statement stops the code as soon as the assertions all pass, and the <code>except</code> and <code>if</code> ensure that any assertion errors are suppressed until/unless we&rsquo;re on the final iteration of the loop.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s call this a <code>for</code>-<code>try</code>-<code>break</code>-<code>except</code>-<code>if</code>-<code>raise</code> pattern.
It&rsquo;s an absurdly verbose name fitting of absurdly verbose code.</p>

<p>This <code>for</code>-<code>try</code>-<code>break</code>-<code>except</code>-<code>if</code>-<code>raise</code> pattern works pretty well!
But it&rsquo;s not pretty.</p>

<p>Like many programmers, I believe that <strong>Don&rsquo;t Repeat Yourself</strong> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">DRY</a>) need not apply to tests.
Tests are <em>allowed</em> to be repetitive if <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6453235/what-does-damp-not-dry-mean-when-talking-about-unit-tests">the verbosity improves readability</a>.</p>

<p>But there is <em>so much noise</em> in that code!
I decided that removing some noise might improve readability.
So I devised a helper utility to reduce the repetition.</p>

<h2>In search of a solution</h2>

<p>While pondering the repetitive noise in this code, I wondered what Python features I could use to abstract away this <code>for</code>-<code>try</code>-<code>break</code>-<code>except</code>-<code>if</code>-<code>raise</code> pattern.</p>

<p>Could I make a context manager and use a <code>with</code> block?
That might help with the <code>try</code>-<code>except</code>, but context managers can&rsquo;t run their code block multiple times, so that wouldn&rsquo;t help with the <code>for</code> and the <code>break</code>.
So a context manager is out.</p>

<p>Could I abstract this away into a looping helper by implementing a generator function?
We <em>are</em> looping and generator functions <em>can</em> <code>break</code> early.
But, a generator function can&rsquo;t catch an exception that&rsquo;s raised within the <em>body</em> of a loop.
So a generator function wouldn&rsquo;t work either.</p>

<p>What about a decorator? 🤔</p>

<p>Context managers and decorators both sandwich a block of code.
But decorators sandwich functions and they have the power to run the same function <em>repeatedly</em>.
A decorator might work!</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a decorator that will run a given function up to 10 times (until no <code>AssertionError</code> is raised):</p>

<p>To use this decorator, we would need to define a function and then call that function:</p>

<figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>

</span><span class="line">    <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">assertLess</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">tiny_time</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">micro_time</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">n</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class="line">
</span><span class="line"><span class="n">assertions</span><span class="p">()</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This isn&rsquo;t <em>quite</em> good enough though&hellip;</p>

<ol>
<li>We need a pattern to run code N times (not necessarily exactly 10)</li>
<li>We reference the variables defined in each block in later blocks, so <code>micro_time</code> and <code>tiny_time</code> will need to be available <em>outside</em> that function</li>
<li>We need this function to run just one time right after it&rsquo;s defined&hellip; could we do that automatically?</li>
</ol>


<p>All 3 of these problems are solvable:</p>

<ol>
<li>We need a decorator that accepts arguments</li>
<li>We need to use <em>rarely seen</em> <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/1261961/98187"><code>nonlocal</code></a> statement</li>
<li>We could have the decorator automatically call the decorated function</li>
</ol>

<p>This decorator accepts an <code>n</code> argument which determines the maximum number of times the decorated function should be called.
The decorator then <em>calls</em> the function repeatedly in a <code>for</code> loop and a <code>try</code>-<code>except</code> block.
As soon as an <code>AssertionError</code> is <em>not</em> raised during one of these function calls, the looping stops.</p>

<p>The <em>weirdest</em> part about this decorator is that it calls the decorated function.
Note that the <code>decorator</code> function doesn&rsquo;t define a <code>wrapper</code> function within itself&hellip; it just runs code right away!</p>

<h2>The resulting beautiful Python monstrosity</h2>

<p>The <code>attempt_n_times</code> decorator <strong>immediately calls the function it decorates</strong>.
Each function is defined and immediately called one or more times, in a <code>try</code>-<code>except</code> block within a loop.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;ve named these functions with the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36315309/how-does-python-throw-away-variable-work">throwaway</a> <code>_</code> name: <strong>we don&rsquo;t care about the name of a function we&rsquo;re never going to refer to again</strong>.</p>

<p>Also note the use of the <code>nonlocal</code> statement.
Each function in Python has its own scope and all assignments <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/local-and-global-variables/#assigning-to-local-and-global-variables">assign to the local scope</a> by default.
That <code>nonlocal</code> variable pulls those variables to the scope of the outer function instead.</p>

<p>Compare the above code to the code just before this refactor:</p>

<p>I find the refactored version easier to skim.</p>

<p>But that <code>attempt_n_times</code> decorator <em>does</em> abuse the decorator syntax.
Decorators aren&rsquo;t <em>meant</em> to call the function they&rsquo;re decorating.</p>

<p>Is this misuse of decorators worth it?</p>

<h2>Is this worth it?</h2>

<p>Decorators aren&rsquo;t supposed to immediately call the function they decorate.
But there&rsquo;s nothing stopping them from doing so.
I feel that I&rsquo;ve traded &ldquo;normal code&rdquo; for a beautiful monstrosity that&rsquo;s easier to skim at a glance.</p>

<p>The <code>attempt_n_times</code> decorator is pretending that it&rsquo;s a block-level tool by using a function because there&rsquo;s no other way to invent such a tool in Python.</p>

<p>I think abstracting away the <code>for</code>-<code>try</code>-<code>break</code>-<code>except</code>-<code>if</code>-<code>raise</code> pattern was worth it, even though I ended up abusing Python&rsquo;s decorator syntax in the process.</p>

<p>What do you think?
Was that <code>attempt_n_times</code> abstraction worth it?</p>
