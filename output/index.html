            Today we’re digging into the Model Context Protocol, or MCP. Think LSP for AI: build a small Python service once and your tools and data show up across editors and agents like VS Code, Claude Code, and more. My guest, Den Delimarsky from Microsoft, helps build this space and will keep us honest about what’s solid versus what's just shiny. We’ll keep it practical: transports that actually work, guardrails you can trust, and a tiny server you could ship this week. By the end, you’ll have a clear mental model and a path to plug Python into the internet of agents.

            <p>It&#8217;s been a busy, bumpy week with coverage.py. Some things did not go
smoothly, and I didn&#8217;t handle everything as well as I could have.</p><p>It started with trying to fix <a href="https://github.com/coveragepy/coveragepy/issues/2064" rel="external noopener">issue 2064</a> about
conflicts between the &#8220;sysmon&#8221; measurement core and a concurrency setting.</p><p>To measure your code, coverage.py needs to know what code got executed. To
know that, it collects execution events from the Python interpreter. CPython now
has two mechanisms for this: trace functions and sys.monitoring.  Coverage.py
has two implementations of a trace function (in C and in Python), and an
implementation of a sys.monitoring listener.  These three components are the
measurement cores, known as &#8220;ctrace&#8221;, &#8220;pytrace&#8221;, and &#8220;sysmon&#8221;.</p><p>The fastest is sysmon, but there are coverage.py features it doesn&#8217;t yet
support.  With Python 3.14, sysmon is the default core.  Issue 2064 complained
that when the defaulted core conflicted with an explicit concurrency choice, the
conflict resulted in an error.  I agreed with the issue: since the core was
defaulted, it shouldn&#8217;t be an error, we should choose a different core.</p><p>But I figured if you explicitly asked for the sysmon core and also a
conflicting setting, that should be an error because you&#8217;ve got two settings
that can&#8217;t be used together.</p><p>Implementing all that got a little involved because of &#8220;metacov&#8221;: coverage.py
coverage-measuring itself.  The sys.monitoring facility in Python was added in
3.12, but wasn&#8217;t fully fleshed out enough to do branch coverage until 3.14. When
we measure ourselves, we use branch coverage, so 3.12 and 3.13 needed some
special handling to avoid causing the error that sysmon plus branch coverage
would cause.</p><p>I got it all done, and <a href="https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/7.11.3/changes.html#version-7-11-1-2025-11-07" rel="external noopener">released 7.11.1</a> on Friday.</p><p>Soon, <a href="https://github.com/coveragepy/coveragepy/issues/2077" rel="external noopener">issue 2077</a> arrived. Another fix in 7.11.1
involved some missing branches when using the sysmon core.  That fix required
parsing the source code during execution.  But sometimes the &#8220;code&#8221; can&#8217;t be
parsed: Jinja templates compile html files to Python and use the html file as
the file name for the code. When coverage.py tries to parse the html file as
Python, of course it fails. My fix didn&#8217;t account for this.  I fixed that on
Saturday and <a href="https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/7.11.3/changes.html#version-7-11-2-2025-11-08" rel="external noopener">released 7.11.2</a>.</p><p>In the meantime, <a href="https://github.com/coveragepy/coveragepy/issues/2076" rel="external noopener">issue 2076</a> and <a href="https://github.com/coveragepy/coveragepy/issues/2078" rel="external noopener">issue
2078</a> both pointed out that now some settings combinations that used to
produce warnings now produced errors. This is a breaking change, they said, and
should not have been released as a patch version.</p><p>To be honest, my first reaction was that it wasn&#8217;t that big a deal, the
settings were in conflict. Fix the settings and all will be well.  It&#8217;s hard to
remember all of the possibilities when making changes like this, it&#8217;s easy to
make mistakes, and semantic versioning is bound to have judgement calls anyway.
I had already spent a while getting 7.11.1 done, and .2 followed just a day
later. I was annoyed and didn&#8217;t want to have to re-think everything.</p><p>But the more I thought about it, I decided they were right: it does break
pipelines that used to work.  And falling back to a different core is fine: the
cores differ in speed and compatibility but (for the most part) produce the same
results. Changing the requested core with a warning is a fine way to deal with
the settings conflict without stopping test suites from running.</p><p>So I just <a href="https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/7.11.3/changes.html#version-7-11-3-2025-11-09" rel="external noopener">released 7.11.3</a> to go back to the older
behavior. Maybe I won&#8217;t have to do another release tomorrow!</p><p>While all this was going on, I also moved the code from my personal GitHub
account to a new <a href="https://github.com/coveragepy" rel="external noopener">coveragepy GitHub
organization</a>!</p><p>Coverage.py is basically a one-man show. Maybe the GitHub organization will
make others feel more comfortable chiming in, but I doubt it. I&#8217;d like to have
more people to talk through changes with.  Maybe I wouldn&#8217;t have had to make
three releases in three days if someone else had been around as a sounding
board.</p><p>I&#8217;m in the <a href="https://discord.gg/RBw567RyWc" rel="external noopener">#coverage-py</a> channel if you want to talk
about any aspect of coverage.py, or I can be reached in
<a href="https://nedbatchelder.com/site/aboutned.html">lots of other ways</a>. I&#8217;d love to talk to
you.</p>

            <p>I’ve recently migrated my VPS from Fedora to Ubuntu. Here’s a list of things that might be useful to keep in mind before, during, and after a migration of a server that hosts publicly accessible Web sites and applications, as well as other personal services, and how to get rid of the most annoying parts of Ubuntu.</p>
<!-- TEASER_END -->

<h2>Why switch?</h2>
<p>Fedora is a relatively popular distro, so it’s well supported by software vendors. Its packagers adopt a no-nonsense approach, making very little changes that deviate from the upstream.</p>
<p>Ubuntu is not my favorite distro, far from it. While it is perhaps the most popular distro out there, its packages contain many more patches compared to Fedora, and Canonical (the company behind Ubuntu) are famous for betting on the wrong horse (Unity, upstart, Mir…). But one thing Ubuntu does well is stability. Fedora makes releases every 6 months, and those releases are supported for just 13 months, which means upgrading at least every year. Every upgrade may introduce incompatibilities, almost every upgrade requires recreating Python venvs. That gets boring fast, and it does not necessarily bring benefits. Granted, the Fedora system upgrade works quite well, and I upgraded through at least eight releases without a re-install, but I would still prefer to avoid it. That’s why I went with Ubuntu LTS, which is supported for five years, with a new release every two years, but which still comes with reasonably new software (and with many third-party repositories if something is missing or outdated).</p>
<h2>Test your backups</h2>
<p>I have a backup “system” that’s a bunch of Bash scripts. After upgrading one of the services that is being backed up, the responsible script started crashing, and thus backups stopped working. Another thing that broke was e-mails from cron, so I didn’t know anything was wrong.</p>
<p>While I do have full disk backups enabled at <a href="https://hetzner.cloud/?ref=Qy1lehF8PwzP">Hetzner</a> <em>(disclaimer: referral link)</em>, my custom backups are more fine-grained (e.g. important configuration files, database dumps, package lists), so they are quite useful in migrating between OSes.</p>
<p>So, here’s a reminder not only to test your backups regularly, but also to make sure they are being created at all, and to make sure cron can send you logs somewhere you can see them.</p>
<p>Bonus cron tip: set <code>MAILFROM=</code> and <code>MAILTO=</code> in your crontab if your SMTP server does not like the values cron uses by default.</p>
<h2>Think about IP address reassignment (or pray to the DNS gods)</h2>
<p>A new VPS or cloud server probably means a new IP address. But if you get a new IP address, that might complicate the migration of your publicly accessible applications. If you’re proxying all your Web properties through Cloudflare or something similar, that’s probably not an issue. But if you have a raw A record somewhere, things can get complicated. DNS servers and operating systems do a lot of caching. The conventional wisdom is to wait 24 or even 48 hours after changing DNS values. This might be true if your TTL is set to a long value, but if your TTL is short, the only worry are DNS servers that ignore TTL values and cache records for longer. If you plan a migration, it’s good to check your TTL well in advance, and not worry too much about broken DNS servers.</p>
<p>But you might not need a new IP. Carefully review your cloud provider’s IP management options before making any changes. Hetzner is more flexible than other hosts in this regard, as it is possible to <a href="https://docs.hetzner.com/cloud/servers/primary-ips/faq">move primary public IP addresses (not “floating” or “elastic” IPs) between servers</a>, as long as you’re okay with a few minutes’ downtime (you will need to shut down the source and destination servers).</p>
<p>If you’re not okay with any downtime, you would probably want to leverage the floating/elastic IP feature, or hope DNS propagates quickly enough.</p>
<h2>Trim the fat</h2>
<p>My VPS ran a lot of services I don’t need anymore, but never really got around to decommissioning. For example, I had a full Xfce install with VNC access (the VNC server was only running when needed). I haven’t actually used the desktop for ages, so I just dropped it.</p>
<p>I also had an OpenVPN setup. It was useful years ago, when mobile data allowances were much smaller and speeds much worse. These days, I don’t use public WiFi networks at all, unless I’m going abroad, and I just buy one month of <a href="https://mullvad.net/">Mullvad VPN</a> for €5 whenever that happens. So, add another service to the “do not migrate” list.</p>
<p>One thing that I could not just remove was the e-mail server. Many years ago, I ran a reasonably functional e-mail server on my VPS. I’ve since then migrated to <a href="https://www.zoho.com/mail/">Zoho Mail</a> (which costs €10.80/year), in part due to IP reputation issues after changing hosting providers, and also to avoid having to fight spam. When I did that, I kept Postfix around, but as a local server for things like cron or Django to send e-mail with, and I configured it to send all e-mails via Zoho. But I did not really want to move over all the configuration, hoping that Ubuntu’s Postfix packages can work with my hacked together config from Fedora. So I replaced the server with <a href="https://www.opensmtpd.org/">OpenSMTPD</a> (from the OpenBSD project), and all the Postfix configuration files with just one short configuration file:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">table aliases file:/etc/aliases
table secrets file:/etc/mail-secrets

listen on localhost
listen on 172.17.0.1 # Docker

action "relay" relay host smtp+tls://smtp@smtp.example.net:587 auth &lt;secrets&gt; mail-from "@example.com"

match from any for any action "relay"
</pre></div>

<h2>Dockerize everything…</h2>
<p>My server runs a few different apps, some of which are exposed on the public Internet, while some do useful work in the background. The services I have set up most recently are containerized with the help of Docker. The only Docker-based service that was stateful (and did not just use folders mounted as volumes) was a MariaDB database. Migrating that is straightforward with a simple dump-and-restore.</p>
<p>Of course, not everything on my server is in Docker. The public-facing nginx install isn’t, and neither is PostgreSQL (but that was also a quick dump-and-restore migration with some extra steps).</p>
<h2>…especially Python</h2>
<p>But then, there are the Python apps. Python the language is cool (if a little slow), but the packaging story is a <a href="https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2023/01/15/how-to-improve-python-packaging/">total</a> dumpster <a href="https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2024/01/15/python-packaging-one-year-later/">fire</a>.</p>
<p>By the way, here’s a quick recap of 2024/2025 in Python packaging: the most hyped Python package manager (<code>uv</code>) is written in Rust, which screams “Python is a toy language in which you can’t even write a tool as simple as a package manager”. (I know, dependency resolution is computationally expensive, so doing <em>that</em> in Rust makes sense, but everything else could easily be done in pure Python. And no, the package manager should not manage Python installs.) Of course, almost all the other contenders listed in my 2023 post are still being developed. On the standards front, the community finally produced a lockfile standard after years of discussions.</p>
<p>Anyway, I have three Python apps. One of them is <a href="https://isso-comments.de/">Isso</a>, which is providing the comments box below this post. I used to run a modified version of Isso a long time ago, but I don’t need to anymore. I looked at the docs, and they offer <a href="https://isso-comments.de/docs/reference/installation/#using-docker">a pre-built Docker image</a>, which means I could just quickly deploy it on my server with Docker and skip the pain of managing Python environments.</p>
<p>The other two apps are Django projects built by yours truly. They are not containerized, they exist in venvs created using the system Python. Moving venvs between machines is generally impossible, so I had to re-create them. Of course, I hit a deprecation, because the Python maintainers (especially in the packaging world) does not understand their responsibility as maintainers of the most popular programming language. This time, it was caused by <a href="https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11457">an old editable install with setuptools (using setup.py develop, not PEP 660)</a>, and installs with more recent pip/setuptools versions would not have this error… although <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/do-we-want-to-keep-the-build-system-default-for-pyproject-toml/104759">some people want to remove the fallback to setuptools if there is no pyproject.toml</a>, so you need to stay up to date with the whims of the Python packaging industry if you want to use Python software.</p>
<h2>Don’t bother with ufw</h2>
<p>Ubuntu ships with <code>ufw</code>, the “uncomplicated firewall”, in the default install. I was previously using <code>firewalld</code>, a Red Hat-adjacent project, but I decided to give ufw a try. Since if it’s part of the default install, it might be supported better by the system.</p>
<p>It turns out that Docker and ufw <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/network/packet-filtering-firewalls/#docker-and-ufw">don’t play together</a>. <a href="https://github.com/chaifeng/ufw-docker?tab=readme-ov-file#solving-ufw-and-docker-issues">Someone has built a set of rules that are supposed to fix it</a>, but that did not work for me.</p>
<p>Docker <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/network/packet-filtering-firewalls/#integration-with-firewalld">does integrate with firewalld</a>, and Ubuntu has packages for it, so I just installed it, enabled the services that need to be publicly available and things were working again.</p>
<h2>Kill the ads (and other nonsense too)</h2>
<p>Red Hat makes money by selling a stable OS with at least 10 years of support to enterprises, and their free offering is Fedora, with just 13 months of support; RHEL releases are branched off from Fedora. SUSE also sells SUSE Linux Enterprise and has openSUSE as the free offering (but the relationship between the paid and free version is more complicated).</p>
<p>Ubuntu chose a different monetization strategy: the enterprise offering is the same OS as the free offering, but it gets extra packages and extra updates. The free OS advertises the paid services. It is fairly simple to get rid of them all:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">sudo apt autoremove ubuntu-pro-client
sudo chmod -x /etc/update-motd.d/*
</pre></div>

<p>Also, Ubuntu installs snap by default. Snap is a terrible idea. Luckily, there are no snaps installed by default on a Server install, so we can just remove <code>snapd</code>. We’ll also remove <code>lxd-installer</code> to save ~25 kB of disk space, since the installer requires snap, and lxd is another unsuccessful Canonical project.</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">sudo apt autoremove snapd lxd-installer
</pre></div>

<h2>The cost of downgrading</h2>
<p>Going from Fedora 42 (April 2025) to Ubuntu 24.04 (April 2024) means some software will be downgraded in the process. In general, this does not matter, as most software does not mind downgrades as much. One notable exception is WeeChat, the IRC client, whose config files are versioned, and Ubuntu’s version is not compatible with the one in Fedora. But here’s where Ubuntu’s popularity shines: <a href="https://weechat.org/download/debian/">WeeChat has its own repositories for Debian and Ubuntu</a>, so I could just get the latest version without building it myself or trying to steal packages from a newer version.</p>
<p>Other than WeeChat, I haven’t experienced any other issues with software due to a downgrade. Some of it is luck (or not using new/advanced features), some of it is software caring about backwards compatibility.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Was it worth it? Time will tell. Upgrading Fedora itself was not that hard, and I expect Ubuntu upgrades to be OK too — the annoying part was cleaning up and getting things to work after the upgrade, and the switch means I will have to do it only every 2-4 years instead of every 6-12 months.</p>
<p>The switchover took a few hours, especially since I didn’t have much up-to-date documentation of what is actually installed and running, and there are always the minor details where distros differ that may require adjusting to. I think a migration like this is worth trying if rolling-release or frequently-released distros are too unstable for your needs.</p>

            <p>Last week, we had a great time at <a href="https://www.pycon.fr/2025/">PyCon FR 2025</a> - a free (!) gathering for Pythonistas in France. Here are some of our highlights.</p>
<h3 id="s-sprints-on-django-our-website-ia-marketing">Sprints on Django, our website, IA, marketing</h3>
<p>Over two days, the conference started with <strong>27 contributors</strong> joining us to contribute to <strong>Django</strong> and our website and online presence. Half in the room were complete newcomers to open source, wanting to get a taste of what it’s like behind the scenes. We also had people who were new to Django, taking the excellent <a href="https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/">Django Girls tutorial</a> to get up to speed with the project. The tutorial is translated in 20 languages(!), so it’s excellent in situations like this where people come from all over Europe.</p>

<p>Carmen, one of our sprint contributors, took the time to test that our software for ongoing Board elections is accessible 💚</p>

<h3 id="s-discussing-djangos-direction">Discussing Django’s direction</h3>
<p>At the sprints, we also organized discussions on Django’s direction - specifically on marketing, Artificial Intelligence, and technical decisions. Some recurring topics were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Highlights from the <a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/pycharm/2025/10/the-state-of-django-2025/">State of Django 2025</a> report produced by JetBrains, and the need for fundraising partnerships like their ongoing <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/promo/support-django/">30% Off PyCharm Pro – 100% for Django</a> campaign.</li>
<li>What “batteries included” means for Django in 2025. Does it include REST? Contributors discussed the recent forum thread <a href="https://forum.djangoproject.com/t/django-needs-a-rest-story/42814">Django needs a REST story</a>.</li>
<li>Type hints and Django. The <a href="https://github.com/django/new-features/issues/23">existing feature requests</a>, and how feature requests are meant to work for Django.</li>
<li>The impact of Artificial Intelligence on Django and Django developers. How AI adoption could be supported with documentation investments, but also the ethical concerns of AI coding.</li>
</ul>
<p>We had a great time during those two days of sprints ❤️ thank you to everyone involved, we hope you stick around!</p>
<h3 id="s-design-systems-with-jinjax-stimulus-and-cube-css">Design systems with JinjaX, Stimulus, and Cube CSS</h3>
<p><a href="https://m4dz.net/">Mads</a> demonstrated how to bring a design-system mindset to Django projects by combining <a href="https://github.com/jpsca/jinjax">JinjaX</a>, <a href="https://stimulus.hotwired.dev/">Stimulus JS</a>, and <a href="https://cube.fyi/">Cube CSS</a>. Supported by modern tooling like <strong>Figma</strong>, <strong>Vite</strong>, and <strong>Storybook</strong>. JinjaX in particular, allows to take a more component-driven “lego blocks” approach to front-end development with Django.</p>
<p><img alt="Mads on stage with title slide about design systems at PyCon FR" src="https://media.djangoproject.com/blog/images/2025/11/PyConFR2025_20251101_Mads_on_stage_with_title_slide_about_design_sys_KacI2NG.JPG" /></p>
<h3 id="s-three-years-of-htmx-in-django">Three years of htmx in Django</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/celinemartinet1/">Céline Martinet Sanchez</a> shared her takeaways from using htmx with Django over three years. The verdict? A joyful developer experience, some (solved) challenges with testing.</p>
<p>Her recommended additions to make the most of the two frameworks:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/adamchainz/django-htmx">django-htmx</a>: opinionated htmx integration</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mixxorz/slippers">Slippers</a>: better DX for Django templates</li>
<li><a href="https://factoryboy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">factory_boy</a>: test data generator (alternative to fixtures)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/syrupy-project/syrupy">Syrupy</a>: snapshots for pytest</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="s-becoming-an-open-source-contributor-in-2025">Becoming an open-source contributor in 2025</h3>
<p>In her talk, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amandasavluchinske/">Amanda Savluchinske</a> explored how newcomers can get involved in open source—highlighting the Django community’s <a href="https://djangonaut.space/">Djangonaut Space</a> program. She explains why doing it is great, how to engage with busy maintainers, and specific actions people can take to get started.</p>
<p>We really liked her sharing a prompt she uses with AI, to iterate on questions to maintainers before hitting “send”:</p>
<p>“You are an expert in technical writing. I'm trying to write a message about a question I have about this open-source project I'm contributing to. Here's the link to its repo ‹Add link here›. I want to convey my question to the maintainers in a clear, concise way, at the same time that I want it to have enough context so that the communication happens with the least back and forth possible. I want this question to contain a short, max two sentence summary upfront, and then more context in the text's body. Ask me whatever questions you need about my question and context in order to produce this message.”</p>
<p><img alt="Amanda showcases contributor programs Google Summer of Code and Djangonaut Space" src="https://media.djangoproject.com/blog/images/2025/11/PyConFR2025_20251102_Amanda_showcases_contributor_programs_Google_Su_oSIShcj.JPG" /></p>
<h3 id="s-la-suite-numerique-government-collaboration-powered-by-django">La Suite numérique: government collaboration powered by Django</h3>
<p>PyCon FR also featured <a href="https://lasuite.numerique.gouv.fr/en">La Suite numérique</a>, the French government’s collaborative workspace—developed with partners in Germany, the Netherlands (<a href="https://minbzk.github.io/mijn-bureau/">Mijn Bureau</a>), and Italy. Their platform includes collaborative documents, video calls, chat, and an AI assistant — all powered by Django 🤘. This work is now part of a wider European Union initiative for sovereign digital infrastructure based on open source, for more information see: <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/commission-launch-digital-commons-edic-support-sovereign-european-digital-infrastructure-and">Commission to launch Digital Commons EDIC to support sovereign European digital infrastructure and technology</a>.</p>

<p><strong>لماذا هو سر؟</strong>
هذا الكتاب يأخذك بعيداً عن عالم “البرامج النصية” و “التطبيقات البسيطة” إلى عالم <strong>هندسة البرمجيات الحقيقية</strong>. السر الذي لا يخبرك به أحد هو أن أفضل الواجهات البرمجية ليست مجرد طبقة فوق قاعدة البيانات؛ إنها انعكاس لنطاق العمل (Business Domain). هذا الكتاب يعلمك كيفية تحقيق ذلك باستخدام <strong>التصميم الموجه بالمجال (Domain-Driven Design - DDD)</strong> و<strong>الهندسة النظيفة (Clean Architecture)</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>ماذا ستتعلم لبناء APIs أفضل؟</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>فصل الاهتمامات:</strong> كيف تفصل منطق عملك الأساسي عن تفاصيل إطار العمل (مثل Flask) وقاعدة البيانات. هذا يعني أنه يمكنك تغيير قاعدة بياناتك أو حتى إطار عمل الويب دون إعادة كتابة قلب تطبيقك.</li>

<p><strong>لماذا هو سر؟</strong>
عندما تبدأ في بناء أكثر من API واحد، فإنك تدخل عالم الأنظمة الموزعة، سواء أدركت ذلك أم لا. هذا العالم له قواعده الخاصة وتحدياته الخفية. يتجاهل معظم المطورين هذه التعقيدات حتى تنهار أنظمتهم. هذا الكتاب هو الدليل الشامل لفلسفة الخدمات المصغرة، وهو أمر ضروري لأي شخص يصمم APIs تتفاعل مع بعضها البعض.</p>

<p><strong>المؤلف:</strong> داين هيلارد (Dane Hillard)</p>

<p><strong>لماذا هو سر؟</strong>
كتابة كود يعمل أمر سهل. كتابة كود يمكن لزملائك (أو أنت المستقبلي) فهمه وصيانته وتوسيعه هو التحدي الحقيقي. هذا الكتاب لا يركز على ميزات اللغة بقدر ما يركز على <strong>العادات والممارسات</strong> التي تحول المبرمج الجيد إلى مطور محترف وموثوق.</p>

<p><strong>ماذا ستتعلم لبناء APIs أفضل؟</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>التصميم من أجل الصيانة:</strong> تقنيات لجعل الكود الخاص بك، بما في ذلك منطق الـ API، أكثر مرونة للتغييرات المستقبلية.</li>
  <li><strong>فصل الكود:</strong> استراتيجيات عملية لتفكيك الكود إلى مكونات مستقلة وقابلة لإعادة الاستخدام، مما يجعل واجهاتك البرمجية أنظف.</li>
  <li><strong>قوة التجريد:</strong> متى ولماذا تنشئ طبقات تجريد في الكود الخاص بك لحماية واجهتك البرمجية من التغييرات في التفاصيل الداخلية.</li>
  <li><strong>الكتابة من أجل الآخرين:</strong> يركز الكتاب على أن الكود يُقرأ أكثر مما يُكتب، وهي فلسفة أساسية لتصميم واجهات برمجية ناجحة يفهمها ويستخدمها الآخرون بسهولة.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote class="story-author-note anim-fade-in">
  <p>رأيي الشخصي: إذا كان ‘Fluent Python’ يعلمك كيف تتحدث بايثون بطلاقة، فإن هذا الكتاب يعلمك كيف تكتب بها مقالات ورسائل واضحة ومقنعة. إنه يتعلق بالجانب الإنساني من البرمجة، وهو ما يتم تجاهله غالباً.</p>

<p class="story-author-note anim-fade-in">هذه ليست مجرد تحسينات طفيفة. نحن نتحدث عن تحويل أجزاء من الكود من دقائق إلى ثوانٍ. هذه هي المعرفة التي تفصل بين المبرمج الهاوي ومهندس البرمجيات المحترف.</p>

<h2 class="story-heading anim-slide-up" id="1-high-performance-python">1. High Performance Python</h2>

<p><strong>العنوان الأصلي:</strong> <em>High Performance Python: Practical Performant Programming for Humans</em>
<strong>العنوان المترجم:</strong> <em>بايثون عالية الأداء: برمجة عملية عالية الأداء للبشر</em>
<strong>المؤلفون:</strong> Micha Gorelick (ميشا غورليك) &amp; Ian Ozsvald (إيان أوزفالد)</p>

<p>هذا الكتاب هو نقطة البداية المثالية وأشبه ما يكون بالكتاب المقدس في هذا المجال. إنه لا يخبرك فقط <em>ماذا</em> تفعل، بل <em>لماذا</em> و<em>متى</em>. يغطي الكتاب كل شيء بدءاً من أساسيات التنميط (profiling) لتحديد الأجزاء البطيئة في الكود، وصولاً إلى تقنيات متقدمة مثل الحوسبة المتوازية واستخدام NumPy بفعالية.</p>

<p><strong>أهم الميزات:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>نهج عملي:</strong> يركز الكتاب على مشاكل واقعية ويقدم حلولاً عملية يمكنك تطبيقها مباشرة.</li>
  <li><strong>تغطية شاملة:</strong> من التنميط إلى تعدد المعالجة (multiprocessing) و Cython.</li>
  <li><strong>أمثلة واضحة:</strong> كل مفهوم مدعوم بأمثلة كود توضح الفرق في الأداء قبل وبعد التحسين.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>السر الذي يكشفه:</strong>
كبار المطورين لا يحسنون كل شيء. إنهم يتبعون قاعدة 80/20: 80% من البطء يأتي من 20% من الكود. يعلمك هذا الكتاب كيف تجد تلك الـ 20% وتجعلها سريعة بشكل مذهل. هذا هو الفرق بين إضاعة أسابيع في تحسينات لا طائل منها، وتحقيق قفزة في الأداء في غضون ساعات.</p>

<p class="story-content page-4 page-type-text anim-fade-in"><strong>كيف تحصل عليه:</strong>
يمكنك شراء الكتاب من Amazon أو O’Reilly. في بعض الأحيان، تتوفر فصول منه كجزء من العروض الترويجية للم الناشر.</p>

<hr />
<h2 class="story-heading anim-slide-up" id="2-cython-a-guide-for-python-programmers">2. Cython: A Guide for Python Programmers</h2>

<p><strong>العنوان الأصلي:</strong> <em>Cython: A Guide for Python Programmers</em>
<strong>العنوان المترجم:</strong> <em>سايثون: دليل لمبرمجي بايثون</em>
<strong>المؤلف:</strong> Kurt W. Smith (كيرت دبليو. سميث)</p>

<p>إذا كان الكتاب السابق هو الخريطة، فإن Cython هي الصاروخ الذي ستستخدمه. Cython هي لغة هجينة تتيح لك كتابة كود يشبه بايثون ولكنه يُترجم مباشرة إلى C. النتيجة؟ سرعات يمكن أن تكون <strong>أسرع بمئات المرات</strong> من بايثون النقية.</p>

<p><strong>أهم الميزات:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>شرح متعمق:</strong> الكتاب هو أفضل مرجع شامل لـ Cython، كتبه أحد المساهمين الأساسيين في المشروع.</li>
  <li><strong>التكامل مع C:</strong> يعلمك كيفية استدعاء مكتبات C الموجودة مباشرة من كود Cython الخاص بك.</li>
  <li><strong>إدارة الذاكرة:</strong> يشرح كيفية التعامل مع الذاكرة يدوياً عند الحاجة لتحقيق أقصى أداء.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>السر الذي يكشفه:</strong>
يعرف كبار المطورين أن مترجم بايثون (CPython) نفسه مكتوب بلغة C. Cython تمنحك جسراً مباشراً إلى هذا العالم. السر هنا هو أنك لست مضطراً لإعادة كتابة كل شيء. يمكنك أخذ دالة واحدة بطيئة في مشروعك، تحويلها إلى Cython، وترك بقية الكود كما هو. هذه القدرة على “الجراحة الدقيقة” للأداء هي مهارة لا تقدر بثمن.</p>

<p class="story-content page-5 page-type-text anim-fade-in"><strong>كيف تحصل عليه:</strong>
الكتاب متاح للشراء. للحصول على معرفة مجانية، فإن <strong>توثيق Cython الرسمي</strong> ممتاز ويعتبر بديلاً رائعاً ومفتوح المصدر. ابدأ بصفحة “Cython for NumPy users” إذا كنت تعمل في مجال البيانات.</p>

<h2 class="story-heading anim-slide-up" id="3-fluent-python">3. Fluent Python</h2>

<p><strong>العنوان الأصلي:</strong> <em>Fluent Python: Clear, Concise, and Effective Programming</em>
<strong>العنوان المترجم:</strong> <em>بايثون بطلاقة: برمجة واضحة، موجزة، وفعالة</em>
<strong>المؤلف:</strong> Luciano Ramalho (لوتشيانو راماليو)</p>

<p>قد يبدو هذا الكتاب غريباً في قائمة عن الأداء، لكنه ربما يكون الأهم. لماذا؟ لأنه قبل أن تتمكن من جعل الكود سريعاً، يجب أن تفهم <strong>الطريقة الصحيحة</strong> لكتابته. “Fluent Python” لا يعلمك بناء الجملة (syntax)، بل يعلمك <strong>روح</strong> اللغة.</p>

<p><strong>أهم الميزات:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>التركيز على “Pythonic”:</strong> يشرح كيفية استخدام ميزات اللغة الفريدة مثل المولدات (generators)، والديكوريتورز (decorators)، والأساليب السحرية (magic methods).</li>
  <li><strong>هياكل البيانات العميقة:</strong> يغوص في كيفية عمل القواميس، القوائم، والمجموعات من الداخل.</li>
  <li><strong>البرمجة المتزامنة:</strong> يقدم شرحاً رائعاً لـ asyncio، وهو أمر بالغ الأهمية للأداء في المهام المرتبطة بالشبكات.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>السر الذي يكشفه:</strong>
في كثير من الأحيان، الكود البطيء هو ببساطة كود “غير بايثوني”. قد يكتب خريج bootcamp حلقة <code class="highlighter-rouge">for</code> لمعالجة قائمة، بينما يستخدم المطور الخبير “list comprehension” أو مولداً (generator) يقوم بنفس المهمة بشكل أسرع بكثير وباستهلاك ذاكرة أقل. يعلمك هذا الكتاب التفكير “بأسلوب بايثون”، مما يؤدي غالباً إلى كود أكثر أداءً بشكل طبيعي، حتى قبل أن تبدأ في التفكير في التحسين.</p>

<p class="story-content page-6 page-type-text anim-fade-in"><strong>كيف تحصل عليه:</strong>
الكتاب متاح للشراء. النسخة الثانية أحدث وتغطي ميزات بايثون الجديدة. يمكنك متابعة المؤلف على وسائل التواصل الاجتماعي، حيث يشارك الكثير من الأفكار القيمة مجاناً.</p>

<h2 class="story-heading anim-slide-up" id="4-the-c-programming-language-kr">4. The C Programming Language (K&amp;R)</h2>

<p><strong>العنوان الأصلي:</strong> <em>The C Programming Language</em>
<strong>العنوان المترجم:</strong> <em>لغة البرمجة C</em>
<strong>المؤلفون:</strong> Brian W. Kernighan (براين كيرنيغان) &amp; Dennis M. Ritchie (دينيس ريتشي)</p>

<p>نعم، أنت تقرأ هذا بشكل صحيح. أحد أهم الكتب لتصبح خبيراً في أداء بايثون هو كتاب عن لغة C. لماذا؟ لأن CPython، المترجم الأكثر شيوعاً لبايثون، مكتوب بلغة C. لفهم حدود بايثون وكيفية تجاوزها، يجب أن تفهم اللغة التي بنيت عليها.</p>

<p><strong>أهم الميزات:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>الإيجاز والعمق:</strong> الكتاب أسطوري لإيجازه وقدرته على تعليم أساسيات C بقوة.</li>
  <li><strong>العودة إلى المصدر:</strong> يعلمك كيفية عمل المؤشرات (pointers) وإدارة الذاكرة، وهي المفاهيم التي تخفيها بايثون عنك.</li>
  <li><strong>أساس الواجهات:</strong> فهم C هو أساس كتابة وحدات C (C extensions) لبايثون، وهي الطريقة النهائية لتحقيق أقصى سرعة.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>السر الذي يكشفه:</strong>
كبار المطورين لا يخافون من “النزول إلى المعدن”. عندما تصل أداة مثل Cython إلى حدودها، فإنهم لا يترددون في كتابة وحدة C نقية. هذا الكتاب يزيل الغموض عن لغة C ويمنحك الثقة للتعامل معها. المعرفة بكيفية عمل الذاكرة على مستوى منخفض تمنحك منظوراً جديداً تماماً عند كتابة كود بايثون، حتى لو لم تكتب سطراً واحداً من C.</p>

<p class="story-content page-7 page-type-text anim-fade-in"><strong>كيف تحصل عليه:</strong>
الكتاب كلاسيكي ومتاح في كل مكان. يمكنك العثور على نسخ PDF منه بسهولة عبر الإنترنت، على الرغم من أن شراء نسخة ورقية يعتبر طقساً من طقوس المرور للعديد من المبرمجين.</p>

<strong>العنوان المترجم:</strong> <em>لغة البرمجة Rust</em>
<strong>المؤلفون:</strong> Steve Klabnik (ستيف كلابنيك) &amp; Carol Nichols (كارول نيكولز)</p>

<p>هذا هو السر الأكثر حداثة في جعبة كبار مطوري بايثون. بينما كانت C هي الخيار التقليدي لتوسيع بايثون، ظهرت Rust كبديل أكثر أماناً وحداثة. Rust تمنحك سرعة C بدون الصداع المصاحب لإدارة الذاكرة والمؤشرات.</p>

<p><strong>أهم الميزات:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>الأمان أولاً:</strong> نظام الملكية (Ownership) في Rust يمنع فئات كاملة من الأخطاء المتعلقة بالذاكرة والتزامن.</li>
  <li><strong>تكامل ممتاز مع بايثون:</strong> مكتبات مثل PyO3 و Maturin تجعل بناء وحدات Rust لبايثون أمراً سلساً بشكل مدهش.</li>
  <li><strong>أداء لا يضاهى:</strong> Rust تنافس C و C++ مباشرة في الأداء.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>السر الذي يكشفه:</strong>
المستقبل هو الهجين. يدرك المطورون الكبار أن الجمع بين إنتاجية بايثون وأمان وأداء Rust هو مزيج قاتل. إنهم يبنون الأجزاء الحساسة للأداء أو التي تتطلب أماناً عالياً في تطبيقاتهم باستخدام Rust، ثم يعرضونها كوحدات بايثون عادية. هذه التقنية تمنحهم أفضل ما في العالمين، وهي ميزة تنافسية ضخمة.</p>

<p class="story-content page-8 page-type-text anim-fade-in"><strong>كيف تحصل عليه:</strong>
<strong>مجاني تماماً!</strong> الكتاب متاح للقراءة مجاناً على الموقع الرسمي لـ Rust. هذا يجعله أفضل مصدر ممكن للبدء. ابحث عن “The Rust Book” وستجده على الفور.</p>

<p><strong>العنوان العربي:</strong> المكتبة القياسية لبايثون بالأمثلة
<strong>المؤلف:</strong> دوغ هيلمان (Doug Hellmann)</p>

<p><strong>لماذا هو سر؟</strong>
يتجاهل 90% من المطورين الكنز المدفون في بايثون نفسها: المكتبة القياسية. يعتقدون أنها مجرد أدوات أساسية، فيلجؤون مباشرة إلى تثبيت مكتبات خارجية. هذا الكتاب يكشف لك أن المكتبة القياسية هي <strong>صندوق أدوات سحري</strong> مليء بوحدات قوية لحل مشاكل الشبكات، والتعامل مع البيانات، والتشفير، والخيوط المتعددة، وأكثر من ذلك بكثير، وكل ذلك <strong>بدون <code class="highlighter-rouge">pip install</code></strong>.</p>

<p><strong>أهم الميزات:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>شرح بالأمثلة:</strong> كل وحدة مشروحة بكود عملي يوضح حالات الاستخدام.</li>
  <li><strong>تغطية شاملة:</strong> يغطي أجزاء من المكتبة القياسية ربما لم تسمع بها من قبل.</li>
  <li><strong>زيادة الكفاءة:</strong> يعلمك متى تستخدم أداة مدمجة بدلاً من البحث عن حل خارجي، مما يقلل من الاعتماديات ويجعل برامجك أخف وأسرع.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>كيف يمنحك الأفضلية؟</strong>
كبار المطورين يقدرون الكود الذي يعتمد على أقل عدد ممكن من المكتبات الخارجية. إتقانك للمكتبة القياسية يجعلك تبدو خبيراً حقيقياً يعرف أدواته بعمق، وليس مجرد شخص يجمع المكتبات الشائعة.</p>

<h2 class="story-heading anim-slide-up" id="5-mastering-gui-programming-with-python">5. Mastering GUI Programming with Python</h2>

<p><strong>العنوان العربي:</strong> إتقان برمجة الواجهات الرسومية باستخدام بايثون
<strong>المؤلف:</strong> آلان دي مور (Alan D. Moore)</p>

<p><strong>لماذا هو سر؟</strong>
عندما يفكر الناس في واجهات المستخدم مع بايثون، فإنهم غالباً ما يفكرون في تطبيقات الويب. لكن بايثون لديها نظام بيئي قوي لبناء <strong>تطبيقات سطح المكتب الأصلية</strong>. هذا الكتاب يأخذك في رحلة عميقة مع <code class="highlighter-rouge">PyQt</code> و <code class="highlighter-rouge">Tkinter</code>، ويعلمك كيف تبني واجهات رسومية احترافية ومعقدة.</p>

<h2 class="story-heading anim-slide-up" id="6-text-processing-in-python">6. Text Processing in Python</h2>

<p><strong>العنوان العربي:</strong> معالجة النصوص في بايثون
<strong>المؤلف:</strong> ديفيد ميرتز (David Mertz)</p>

<p><strong>لماذا هو سر؟</strong>
كل مطور يتعامل مع النصوص، لكن معظمهم يخدشون السطح باستخدام <code class="highlighter-rouge">split()</code> و <code class="highlighter-rouge">join()</code>. هذا الكتاب، على الرغم من أنه قديم بعض الشيء (مكتوب لبايثون 2)، إلا أن <strong>مبادئه خالدة</strong>. إنه غوص عميق في فن وعلم معالجة النصوص: من الترميز (Unicode) والتعبيرات النمطية (Regex) إلى تقنيات التحليل اللغوي (Parsing) المتقدمة.</p>

<p><strong>أهم الميزات:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>فهم عميق لـ Unicode:</strong> يحل واحدة من أكثر المشاكل إحباطاً للمطورين مرة واحدة وإلى الأبد.</li>
  <li><strong>إتقان التعبيرات النمطية:</strong> يأخذك إلى ما هو أبعد من المطابقة البسيطة.</li>
  <li><strong>تقنيات التحليل:</strong> يقدم نظرة على كيفية بناء محللات بسيطة للنصوص المهيكلة.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>كيف يمنحك الأفضلية؟</strong>

<h2 class="story-heading anim-slide-up" id="7-twisted-network-programming-essentials">7. Twisted Network Programming Essentials</h2>

<p><strong>العنوان العربي:</strong> أساسيات برمجة الشبكات مع Twisted
<strong>المؤلف:</strong> آبي فيتيغ (Abe Fettig)</p>

<p><strong>لماذا هو سر؟</strong>
عندما يتعلق الأمر بالبرمجة غير المتزامنة في بايثون، فإن <code class="highlighter-rouge">AsyncIO</code> يسرق كل الأضواء. لكن قبل <code class="highlighter-rouge">AsyncIO</code> بسنوات، كان هناك <strong>Twisted</strong>، وهو إطار عمل ناضج وقوي للغاية للشبكات يحركها الحدث (event-driven). لا يزال Twisted يستخدم في تطبيقات عالية الأداء وهو مثال رائع على تصميم البرامج غير المتزامنة.</p>

<p><strong>أهم الميزات:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>مدفوع بالحدث:</strong> يعلمك طريقة تفكير مختلفة تماماً عن البرمجة المتسلسلة التقليدية.</li>
  <li><strong>البطاريات متضمنة:</strong> يوفر تطبيقات جاهزة لبروتوكولات الشبكة الشائعة (HTTP, FTP, SSH, 등).</li>
  <li><strong>تصميم قوي:</strong> يعتمد على مفاهيم مثل <code class="highlighter-rouge">Deferreds</code> (المؤجلات) التي كانت مصدر إلهام لـ <code class="highlighter-rouge">Promises</code> و <code class="highlighter-rouge">Futures</code> الحديثة.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>كيف يمنحك الأفضلية؟</strong>
تعلم Twisted لا يعلمك مجرد إطار عمل آخر؛ إنه يعلمك <strong>المبادئ الأولى للبرمجة غير المتزامنة</strong>. فهمك لـ Twisted سيجعل فهمك لـ <code class="highlighter-rouge">AsyncIO</code> أو أي إطار عمل غير متزامن آخر أعمق بعشر مرات. إنه يظهر أنك مطور يفهم تاريخ وتقنيات مجاله بعمق.</p>

<p class="story-content page-10 page-type-list anim-fade-in"><strong>أين تجده؟</strong>
الكتاب متاح للشراء من O’Reilly. وثائق Twisted الرسمية أيضاً ممتازة وتعتبر مصدراً رائعاً للتعلم.</p>

<p>في عالم تطوير البرمجيات، هناك حقيقة لا يناقشها الكثيرون بصوت عالٍ: معظم معسكرات التدريب والدورات التعليمية عبر الإنترنت تُعدّك لتكون <strong>بنّاءً</strong>، لا <strong>مهندس حصون</strong>. يعلمونك كيف تبني الميزات، وكيف تكتب الشيفرة التي ‘تعمل’، لكنهم نادرًا ما يخبرونك عن الجانب المظلم… عن كيفية تحطيم كل ما بنيته.</p>

<p>كبار المطورين، أولئك الذين يشيدون الأنظمة التي تدير ملايين العمليات وتخزن بيانات حساسة، يعرفون سرًا: <strong>الشيفرة التي تعمل ليست بالضرورة شيفرة آمنة</strong>. إنهم يفهمون أن كل سطر يكتبونه قد يكون ثغرة محتملة. هذا الفهم لا يأتي من دورات “بايثون من الصفر إلى الاحتراف”، بل يأتي من دراسة عقلية المهاجم، ومن فهم عميق لكيفية بناء أنظمة صلبة وقادرة على الصمود.</p>

<p>هذه المعرفة هي الخط الفاصل بين المطور المبتدئ والخبير الحقيقي. اليوم، سنكشف عن قائمة الكتب التي تشكل هذا الخط الفاصل.</p>

<blockquote class="story-author-note anim-fade-in">
  <p><strong>الحقيقة الصادمة</strong>: معرفتك ببايثون لا تكتمل أبدًا إذا كنت تعرف فقط كيف تبني، وليس كيف تحمي ما بنيته. هذه الكتب هي خارطة الطريق للجانب الآخر من المعرفة.</p>

<p>لماذا يخفي كبار المطورين هذه المصادر؟ ليس عن قصد بالضرورة. السبب هو أن هذه المعرفة متخصصة وتتطلب عقلية مختلفة. من الأسهل تعليم كيفية استخدام <code class="highlighter-rouge">requests</code> لجلب البيانات، من تعليم كيفية حماية تطبيقك من هجمات <code class="highlighter-rouge">Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)</code> التي تستغل نفس المكتبة.</p>

<p>معظم المطورين يركزون على <strong>الوظائف (Features)</strong>، بينما يركز الخبراء على <strong>الخصائص غير الوظيفية (Non-Functional Requirements)</strong> مثل الأمان، والأداء، وقابلية التوسع. هذه الكتب هي بوابتك لهذا العالم. إنها تعلمك أن تفكر في كل مدخل للمستخدم كسلاح محتمل، وكل اعتمادية (dependency) كحصان طروادة.</p>

<p>هذه ليست مجرد كتب برمجة، إنها كتب استراتيجية. تعلمك كيف تفكر بثلاث خطوات للأمام، تمامًا مثل لاعب الشطرنج المحترف.</p>

  <li><strong>المؤلفون</strong>: Justin Seitz (جاستن سايتس) &amp; Tim Arnold (تيم أرنولد)</li>
  <li><strong>الترجمة الحرفية</strong>: بايثون القبعة السوداء</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>لماذا هو سر؟</strong>
هذا الكتاب هو الدليل العملي لتعلم “عقلية المهاجم”. كبار المطورين لا يقرؤونه ليصبحوا قراصنة، بل ليفهموا كيف يفكر القراصنة. إنه يعلمك كيف تستخدم بايثون، اللغة التي تحبها، لإنشاء أدوات هجومية، واكتشاف الثغرات، والتسلل إلى الشبكات. عندما تعرف كيف تُصنع الأسلحة، تصبح أفضل في صناعة الدروع.</p>

<p><strong>أهم الميزات:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>أمثلة عملية حقيقية</strong>: يعلمك الكتاب كيفية إنشاء تروجان (حصان طروادة) باستخدام GitHub، واعتراض بيانات الشبكة، وتنفيذ هجمات تصعيد الامتيازات.</li>
  <li><strong>تحديثات للعصر الحديث</strong>: يغطي الإصدار الثاني بايثون 3 وتقنيات الهجوم الحديثة، مما يجعله ذا صلة مباشرة باليوم.</li>
  <li><strong>من الهجوم إلى الدفاع</strong>: كل فصل تقرأه عن الهجوم يمنحك رؤى لا تقدر بثمن حول كيفية بناء دفاعاتك.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>كيف يمنحك الأفضلية؟</strong>
خريج المعسكر التدريبي يعرف كيف يبني واجهة برمجة تطبيقات (API). أنت، بعد قراءة هذا الكتاب، ستعرف كيف يمكن استغلال هذه الواجهة بعشر طرق مختلفة، وبالتالي، كيف تحصنها.</p>

<blockquote class="story-author-note anim-fade-in">
  <p><strong>رأيي الشخصي</strong>: هذا الكتاب هو جرعة الأدرينالين التي تحتاجها لتستيقظ من غفلة “البرمجة السعيدة”. سيجعلك تشك في كل سطر برمجي تكتبه، وهذا أمر جيد.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>المؤلف</strong>: Julien Danjou (جوليان دانجو)</li>
  <li><strong>الترجمة الحرفية</strong>: بايثون الجاد</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>لماذا هو سر؟</strong>
لأن معظم المطورين يتوقفون عند مرحلة “الشيفرة تعمل”. هذا الكتاب يبدأ من هناك. إنه لا يتحدث عن بناء جملة بايثون، بل عن بناء <strong>مشاريع بايثون احترافية ومحصنة</strong>. الأمن ليس مجرد فصل في هذا الكتاب، بل هو فلسفة منسوجة في كل صفحة، من هيكلة المشروع إلى النشر والتعامل مع الأخطاء.</p>

<p><strong>أهم الميزات:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>ما بعد الشيفرة</strong>: يغطي الكتاب تصميم الـ API، وإدارة الوحدات، والنشر، والتوزيع، وقابلية التوسع، وكلها جوانب تؤثر بشكل مباشر على أمان التطبيق.</li>
  <li><strong>فصول عن الأمان</strong>: يحتوي على فصول مخصصة مباشرة للأمان، تشرح كيفية التعامل مع الثغرات الشائعة وتطبيق أفضل الممارسات.</li>
  <li><strong>تركيز على الصلابة (Robustness)</strong>: يعلمك كيفية كتابة شيفرة لا تنهار عند أول إدخال غير متوقع، وهو خط الدفاع الأول ضد العديد من الهجمات.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>كيف يمنحك الأفضلية؟</strong>
المطور العادي يسلم شيفرة. أنت ستسلم نظامًا كاملاً، مصممًا ليكون قويًا وآمنًا وقابلاً للصيانة. هذا الكتاب يعلمك عقلية مهندس البرمجيات، وليس مجرد مبرمج.</p>

<blockquote class="story-author-note anim-fade-in">
  <p><strong>رأيي الشخصي</strong>: إذا كان “Black Hat Python” يعلمك الهجوم، فإن “Serious Python” يعلمك بناء القلعة التي لا يمكن اختراقها. إنه الدليل العملي لتحويل مشاريعك من مجرد نصوص برمجية إلى منتجات برمجية حقيقية.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>المؤلف</strong>: José Manuel Ortega (خوسيه مانويل أورتيجا)</li>
  <li><strong>الترجمة الحرفية</strong>: نفس العنوان.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>لماذا هو سر؟</strong>
لأن أمن التطبيقات لا ينفصل عن أمن الشبكات. هذا الكتاب يردم الفجوة بين عالمي تطوير البرمجيات وأمن الشبكات باستخدام بايثون. بينما يركز المطورون على منطق التطبيق، يتجاهلون غالبًا كيفية انتقال البيانات عبر الشبكة، حيث تكمن العديد من المخاطر.</p>

<p><strong>أهم الميزات:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>الأتمتة الأمنية</strong>: يعلمك كيفية أتمتة المهام الأمنية، مثل فحص الشبكات، وتحليل الحزم (packet analysis)، وبناء أدوات مراقبة أمنية خاصة بك.</li>
  <li><strong>من الدفاع إلى الهجوم</strong>: يغطي الكتاب كلاً من التقنيات الدفاعية (مثل بناء جدران الحماية) والتقنيات الهجومية (مثل استغلال خدمات الشبكة).</li>
  <li><strong>مكتبات متخصصة</strong>: ستتعمق في مكتبات مثل <code class="highlighter-rouge">Scapy</code> لتحليل الحزم و<code class="highlighter-rouge">Nmap</code> لفحص الشبكات، وكل ذلك من خلال بايثون.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>كيف يمنحك الأفضلية؟</strong>
ستكون قادرًا على بناء تطبيقات “واعية بالشبكة”. لن تكون مجرد مطور تطبيقات، بل مطور يفهم البنية التحتية التي يعمل عليها تطبيقه، مما يمنحك القدرة على اكتشاف وتخفيف التهديدات التي لا يراها الآخرون.</p>

<blockquote class="story-author-note anim-fade-in">

<ul>
  <li><strong>المؤلف</strong>: Michal Zalewski (ميكال زاليفسكي)</li>
  <li><strong>الترجمة الحرفية</strong>: نفس العنوان.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>لماذا هو سر؟</strong>
لأنه ليس كتاب بايثون! وهذه هي الخدعة. كبار مطوري بايثون (خاصة في مجال الويب) يعرفون أن أمن الويب هو تخصص بحد ذاته، ومبادئه تتجاوز أي لغة برمجة. هذا الكتاب، الذي كتبه أحد أشهر باحثي الأمن في العالم، هو “الكتاب المقدس” لأمن متصفحات الويب.</p>

<p><strong>أهم الميزات:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>محايد لغوياً</strong>: يشرح الكتاب الثغرات الأساسية في بنية الويب نفسها (مثل XSS, CSRF, SOP) بطريقة تجعلك تفهم “لماذا” تحدث، وليس فقط “كيف” تمنعها في Django أو Flask.</li>
  <li><strong>عمق تقني هائل</strong>: يغوص الكتاب في تفاصيل دقيقة حول كيفية عمل المتصفحات، ومعايير HTTP، وسياسات الأمان التي يعتمد عليها كل مطور ويب دون أن يفهمها حقًا.</li>
  <li><strong>عقلية الباحث الأمني</strong>: يعلمك كيف تنظر إلى تطبيق الويب الخاص بك من منظور المتصفح والمهاجم، وليس فقط من منظور الخادم.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>كيف يمنحك الأفضلية؟</strong>
عندما يواجه مطور آخر ثغرة أمنية في الويب، سيبحث عن حل سريع في Stack Overflow. أنت، بعد قراءة هذا الكتاب، ستفهم السبب الجذري للمشكلة على مستوى البروتوكول، مما يمكنك من كتابة شيفرة تمنع فئة كاملة من الثغرات من الحدوث في المقام الأول.</p>

<blockquote class="story-author-note anim-fade-in">
  <p><strong>رأيي الشخصي</strong>: قراءة هذا الكتاب لمطور ويب بايثون تشبه دراسة عالم التشريح لطبيب جراح. قد لا تستخدم كل المعلومات كل يوم، لكنها تغير بشكل أساسي فهمك لكيفية عمل كل شيء، وتجعل قراراتك أكثر دقة وأمانًا.</p>

<h2 class="story-heading anim-slide-up" id="الخلاصة-المعرفة-هي-درعك-الأقوى">الخلاصة: المعرفة هي درعك الأقوى</h2>

<p>الخيط المشترك بين هذه الكتب هو أنها تدفعك خارج “منطقة الراحة” الخاصة بك كمطور. إنها تجبرك على التفكير في الفشل، في الهجوم، وفي نقاط الضعف. وهذه هي الطريقة الوحيدة لبناء برمجيات قوية حقًا.</p>

<p>كبار المطورين لا يمتلكون قدرات سحرية، بل يمتلكون مكتبة أوسع من النماذج العقلية. إنهم لا يرون الشيفرة البرمجية كتعليمات للحاسوب فحسب، بل كسطح هجوم محتمل، كعقد اجتماعي مع المستخدم، وكجزء من نظام بيئي أكبر.</p>

<p>هذه الكتب هي بوابتك لتطوير تلك النماذج العقلية. إنها الاستثمار الذي يميز بين من يكتب الشيفرة، ومن يهندس البرمجيات.</p>

<p><strong>الخطوة التالية لك</strong>: اختر واحدًا من هذه الكتب، واقرأه، وطبقه. لا تقرأه فقط، بل جرب الأمثلة، واكتب الأدوات، وحاول اختراق تطبيقاتك التجريبية. هذه هي الطريقة التي تحول بها المعرفة إلى مهارة، والمهارة إلى خبرة.</p>

<p class="story-content page-1 page-type-text anim-fade-in">لقد أتقنت أساسيات بايثون، وبنيت بعض المشاريع، وربما تعلمت إطار عمل ويب مثل Django أو FastAPI. تشعر بالثقة. لكن هناك فجوة صامتة، فجوة لا تتحدث عنها معسكرات التدريب البرمجي، وهي ما تفصل بين المطور الجيد والمطور الأسطوري. إنها عالم <strong>برمجة الشبكات والأنظمة الموزعة</strong>.</p>

<blockquote class="story-author-note anim-fade-in">
  <p>الحقيقة هي أن معظم المطورين يعرفون كيفية <strong>استهلاك</strong> واجهات برمجة التطبيقات (APIs)، لكن قلة قليلة منهم تعرف كيفية <strong>بناء</strong> البنية التحتية للشبكة التي تجعل هذه الواجهات ممكنة.</p>

<h2 class="story-heading anim-slide-up" id="1-foundations-of-python-network-programming">1. Foundations of Python Network Programming</h2>

<p><strong>العنوان الأصلي:</strong> Foundations of Python Network Programming, 3rd Edition
<strong>المؤلفون:</strong> براندون رودس (Brandon Rhodes) وجون غورزن (John Goerzen)</p>

<p>هذا ليس مجرد كتاب، بل هو حجر الأساس. بينما تعلمك الدورات استخدام مكتبة <code class="highlighter-rouge">requests</code>، يعلمك هذا الكتاب كيف تعمل <code class="highlighter-rouge">requests</code> من الداخل. إنه يغوص عميقاً في <strong>المقابس (Sockets)</strong>، و <strong>بروتوكولات TCP/IP</strong>، وكيفية بناء خوادم وعملاء من الصفر.</p>

<p><strong>ما يخبرك به كبار المطورين سراً:</strong> فهم هذه الأساسيات هو ما يسمح لك بتشخيص المشاكل المعقدة في الشبكة التي تحير الآخرين. عندما يفشل كل شيء، ستعرف أين تبحث لأنك تفهم اللغة التي تتحدث بها أجهزة الكمبيوتر حقًا.</p>

<p><strong>ميزات رئيسية:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>تغطية شاملة لبروتوكولات الإنترنت الأساسية (TCP, UDP, DNS, SMTP).</li>
  <li>أمثلة عملية لبناء خوادم وعملاء شبكة منخفضة المستوى.</li>
  <li>تحديثات للطبعة الثالثة لتشمل بايثون 3 بشكل كامل.</li>

<h2 class="story-heading anim-slide-up" id="2-twisted-network-programming-essentials">2. Twisted Network Programming Essentials</h2>

<p><strong>العنوان الأصلي:</strong> Twisted Network Programming Essentials, 2nd Edition
<strong>المؤلفون:</strong> جيسيكا ماكيلار (Jessica McKellar) وآبي فيتيغ (Abe Fettig)</p>

<p>قبل ظهور <code class="highlighter-rouge">asyncio</code>، كان <strong>Twisted</strong> هو الملك المتوج لبرمجة الشبكات غير المتزامنة في بايثون. إنه إطار عمل ضخم وقوي وموجه بالأحداث (event-driven) بنى تطبيقات أسطورية. كبار المطورين الذين عملوا على أنظمة بايثون القديمة يعرفون ويحترمون Twisted.</p>

<p><strong>ما يخبرك به كبار المطورين سراً:</strong> تعلم Twisted لا يعلمك مجرد إطار عمل، بل يعلمك <strong>نمط تفكير</strong> مختلف تمامًا حول التزامن. فهم نماذج مثل <code class="highlighter-rouge">Deferreds</code> و <code class="highlighter-rouge">Protocols</code> يمنحك منظورًا فريدًا لحل المشاكل المعقدة التي لا يستطيع نموذج الطلب/الاستجابة البسيط حلها.</p>

<p><strong>ميزات رئيسية:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>مقدمة مركزة ومكثفة لإطار عمل معقد.</li>
  <li>يغطي بناء البروتوكولات، والعملاء، والخوادم.</li>
  <li>أمثلة واقعية توضح قوة البرمجة غير المتزامنة.</li>
</ul>

<p class="story-content page-4 page-type-list anim-fade-in"><strong>كيف تحصل عليه:</strong> متاح للشراء. الأهم من ذلك، أن توثيق Twisted الرسمي واسع جدًا ويعتبر كتابًا في حد ذاته.</p>

<blockquote class="story-author-note anim-fade-in">

<p><strong>العنوان الأصلي:</strong> Distributed Systems with Python
<strong>المؤلف:</strong> هاري بيرسيفال (Harry Percival) - المعروف أيضًا بكتابه عن تطوير Django.</p>

<p>هذا الكتاب يأخذك إلى المستوى التالي: من تطبيق واحد على جهاز واحد إلى نظام مكون من عدة خدمات تعمل معًا. هذا هو جوهر هندسة البرمجيات الحديثة. يغطي الكتاب أنماطًا مثل الاتساق (Consistency)، والتوافر (Availability)، وتحمل الأخطاء (Fault Tolerance).</p>

<p><strong>ما يخبرك به كبار المطورين سراً:</strong> بناء الأنظمة الموزعة هو المكان الذي تحدث فيه المشاكل الحقيقية والفشل غير المتوقع. يعلمك هذا الكتاب كيف تفكر مثل مهندس أنظمة، وتتوقع الفشل، وتصمم برامج تستمر في العمل حتى عندما تنهار أجزاء منها. هذه هي المهارة التي تساوي وزنها ذهباً.</p>

<p><strong>ميزات رئيسية:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>مقدمة عملية لمفاهيم الأنظمة الموزعة النظرية.</li>
  <li>يستخدم بايثون لتوضيح الخوارزميات والأنماط المعقدة.</li>

<p><strong>العنوان الأصلي:</strong> gRPC: Up and Running: Building Cloud Native Applications
<strong>المؤلفون:</strong> كاسون إندراسيري (Kasun Indrasiri) و دانيش كوروبو (Danesh Kuruppu)</p>

<p>واجهات برمجة التطبيقات RESTful رائعة، لكنها ليست دائمًا الأداة الأفضل. <strong>gRPC</strong> هو إطار عمل حديث وعالي الأداء للاتصال عن بعد (RPC) من Google. إنه يستخدم HTTP/2 و Protocol Buffers لتحقيق اتصال سريع وفعال بين الخدمات، وهو مثالي للأنظمة المصغرة.</p>

<p><strong>ما يخبرك به كبار المطورين سراً:</strong> بينما لا يزال الجميع يتعلمون FastAPI و Flask، انتقل كبار المطورين بالفعل إلى تقنيات مثل gRPC لبناء العمود الفقري لأنظمتهم. تعلم gRPC يضعك في طليعة هندسة الخدمات المصغرة ويظهر أنك تفكر في الأداء والكفاءة على مستوى النظام بأكمله.</p>

<p><strong>ميزات رئيسية:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>يغطي المفاهيم الأساسية لـ gRPC و Protocol Buffers.</li>
  <li>أمثلة بلغات متعددة، بما في ذلك بايثون.</li>

<p><strong>العنوان بالعربية</strong>: “بايثون بطلاقة، الإصدار الثاني”
<strong>المؤلف</strong>: Luciano Ramalho (لوتشيانو راماليو)</p>

<p>هذا ليس كتابًا عن أنماط التصميم التقليدية، بل هو أعمق من ذلك. هذا الكتاب هو <strong>الكتاب المقدس للكود البايثوني (Pythonic Code)</strong>. يعلمك كيف تستخدم ميزات بايثون الفريدة—نموذج البيانات، المولدات، المزخرفات، البرمجة غير المتزامنة—لكتابة كود ليس فقط فعالاً، بل معبر وأنيق.</p>

<p><strong>ماذا يكشف من أسرار الكبار؟</strong>
كبار المطورين لا يكتبون بايثون كما لو كانت Java أو C++. إنهم “يتحدثون” اللغة بطلاقة. هذا الكتاب يعلمك تلك الطلاقة. ستكتشف لماذا <code class="highlighter-rouge">len(my_collection)</code> أفضل من <code class="highlighter-rouge">my_collection.len()</code>، وكيف تبني كائنات تتصرف تمامًا مثل أنواع بايثون المدمجة. إنه يكشف عن “الروح” الحقيقية لبايثون.</p>

<p><strong>ميزات رئيسية</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>غوص عميق</strong>: يشرح “لماذا” وراء كل ميزة، وليس فقط “كيف”.</li>
  <li><strong>أمثلة عملية</strong>: كل فصل مليء بأمثلة توضح الفروق الدقيقة بين الكود العادي والكود البايثوني.</li>

<p>إذا كان <code class="highlighter-rouge">Fluent Python</code> يعلمك الجمل، فهذا الكتاب يعلمك كيف تكتب رواية. يركز الكتاب على بناء تطبيقات كبيرة وقابلة للصيانة باستخدام تقنيات مثل <strong>تصميم المجال الموجه (Domain-Driven Design - DDD)</strong>، و<strong>الهيكلية النظيفة (Clean Architecture)</strong>، و<strong>أنماط المراسلة القائمة على الأحداث (Event-Driven Patterns)</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>ماذا يكشف من أسرار الكبار؟</strong>
المطورون المبتدئون يخلطون كل شيء معًا: منطق العمل، تفاصيل قاعدة البيانات، وواجهة المستخدم. والنتيجة؟ كرة من الطين لا يمكن صيانتها. كبار المطورين يبنون طبقات واضحة من التجريد. هذا الكتاب يعلمك كيف تفصل “ماذا” يفعله تطبيقك عن “كيف” يفعله. ستتعلم بناء “نموذج مجال” غني هو قلب تطبيقك، مع إبقاء تفاصيل الإطار (مثل Django أو Flask) على الأطراف.</p>

<p><strong>ميزات رئيسية</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>مشروع واقعي</strong>: يطبق المفاهيم على مشروع حقيقي من البداية إلى النهاية.</li>
  <li><strong>تركيز على الاختبار</strong>: يوضح كيف يقود الاختبار عملية التصميم (TDD).</li>
  <li><strong>لا يعتمد على إطار عمل</strong>: يعلمك مبادئ يمكنك تطبيقها مع أي إطار عمل أو حتى بدونه.</li>

<p>السر الذي لا يدركه الكثيرون: بايثون تأتي مع مجموعة هائلة من “البطاريات المضمنة”. قبل أن تبحث عن مكتبة خارجية، غالبًا ما يكون الحل موجودًا بالفعل في المكتبة القياسية، وهو مُحسَّن ومُختبَر جيدًا. هذا الكتاب هو جولتك الإرشادية في هذا الكنز المخفي.</p>

<p><strong>ماذا يكشف من أسرار الكبار؟</strong>
كبار المطورين لا يعيدون اختراع العجلة. إنهم يعرفون أدواتهم جيدًا. هل تحتاج إلى التعامل مع ملفات CSV معقدة؟ استخدم وحدة <code class="highlighter-rouge">csv</code>. هل تحتاج إلى إنشاء قاعدة بيانات خفيفة الوزن؟ <code class="highlighter-rouge">sqlite3</code> موجود. هل تريد التعامل مع مسارات الملفات بطريقة مستقلة عن نظام التشغيل؟ <code class="highlighter-rouge">pathlib</code> هو صديقك. هذا الكتاب يكشف عن قوة الوحدات التي ربما لم تسمع بها من قبل، مثل <code class="highlighter-rouge">itertools</code> للتعامل المتقدم مع المكررات، أو <code class="highlighter-rouge">functools</code> للبرمجة الوظيفية.</p>

<p><strong>ميزات رئيسية</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>شامل</strong>: يغطي جزءًا كبيرًا جدًا من المكتبة القياسية.</li>
  <li><strong>قائم على الأمثلة</strong>: كل وحدة مشروحة بمثال عملي يوضح كيفية استخدامها.</li>
  <li><strong>منظم</strong>: مقسم حسب الوظيفة (نصوص، هياكل بيانات، شبكات، إلخ)، مما يسهل العثور على ما تحتاجه.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>كيف تحصل عليه؟</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>شراء</strong>: متاح على Amazon.</li>
  <li><strong>مجاناً</strong>: يحتفظ المؤلف بمدونة (<code class="highlighter-rouge">Python Module of the Week</code> أو <code class="highlighter-rouge">PyMOTW</code>) وهي أساس الكتاب ومتاحة بالكامل على الإنترنت.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>العنوان بالعربية</strong>: “الهياكل النظيفة في بايثون، الإصدار الثاني”
<strong>المؤلف</strong>: Leonardo Giordani (ليوناردو جيورداني)</p>

<p>هذا الكتاب يأخذ مبادئ “الهندسة النظيفة” التي شاعها روبرت سي. مارتن (العم بوب) ويطبقها بشكل عملي ومباشر في عالم بايثون. إنه دليل تكتيكي لبناء تطبيقات قوية، قابلة للاختبار، ومستقلة عن الأطر وقواعد البيانات.</p>

<p><strong>ماذا يكشف من أسرار الكبار؟</strong>
يكشف سر <strong>“قاعدة انعكاس التبعية” (Dependency Inversion Principle)</strong>. المطورون المبتدئون يجعلون منطق العمل يعتمد على تفاصيل مثل قاعدة البيانات أو واجهة برمجة التطبيقات. هذا يجعل الكود هشًا وصعب الاختبار. كبار المطورين يعكسون هذا الاعتماد: التفاصيل يجب أن تعتمد على التجريدات (Interfaces)، وليس العكس. يعلمك هذا الكتاب كيفية استخدام التجريد لفصل منطق عملك الأساسي عن العالم الخارجي الفوضوي.</p>

<p><strong>ميزات رئيسية</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>عملي وموجز</strong>: يركز على التطبيق العملي للمبادئ بدلاً من التنظير الطويل.</li>
  <li><strong>أمثلة بايثونية</strong>: يوضح كيفية تطبيق المفاهيم باستخدام ميزات بايثون مثل <code class="highlighter-rouge">dataclasses</code> و <code class="highlighter-rouge">typing</code>.</li>
  <li><strong>تركيز على الاختبار</strong>: يوضح كيف أن الهندسة النظيفة تجعل اختبار الوحدات (Unit Testing) سهلاً للغاية.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>كيف تحصل عليه؟</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>شراء</strong>: متاح على Leanpub.</li>
  <li><strong>مجاناً</strong>: المؤلف جعل الكتاب متاحًا للقراءة مجانًا على موقعه <code class="highlighter-rouge">leanpub.com/clean-architectures-in-python</code>.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote class="story-author-note anim-fade-in story-content page-7 page-type-text anim-fade-in">
  <p>بعد قراءة هذا الكتاب، ستفهم أن إطار العمل ليس تطبيقك. قاعدة البيانات ليست تطبيقك. تطبيقك هو منطق العمل النقي في المنتصف، وكل شيء آخر هو مجرد تفصيل قابل للاستبدال.</p>

<strong>المؤلف</strong>: Sakis Kasampalis (ساكيس كاسامباليس)</p>

<p>هذا الكتاب هو دليلك الشامل لأنماط التصميم الكلاسيكية (GoF) والحديثة، كلها مطبقة في بايثون. إنه بمثابة صندوق أدوات عقلي يمكنك الرجوع إليه عندما تواجه مشكلة تصميم متكررة.</p>

<p><strong>ماذا يكشف من أسرار الكبار؟</strong>
كبار المطورين لا يحلون كل مشكلة من الصفر. إنهم يتعرفون على “شكل” المشكلة ويطبقون “نمطًا” مجربًا ومختبرًا لحلها. هذا الكتاب يعلمك لغة التصميم المشتركة هذه. ستتعلم متى تستخدم نمط المصنع (Factory) بدلاً من المُنشئ المباشر، وكيف يبسط نمط الواجهة (Facade) نظامًا معقدًا، ولماذا يعد نمط المراقب (Observer) مثاليًا للتطبيقات التفاعلية.</p>

<p><strong>ميزات رئيسية</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>تغطية واسعة</strong>: يغطي الأنماط الإنشائية (Creational)، الهيكلية (Structural)، والسلوكية (Behavioral)، بالإضافة إلى أنماط أخرى.</li>
  <li><strong>أمثلة من العالم الحقيقي</strong>: يربط كل نمط بسيناريو عملي يمكنك أن تتخيله.</li>
  <li><strong>تحديثات بايثون الحديثة</strong>: الإصدار الثالث يتضمن استخدامات لميزات بايثون الحديثة مثل <code class="highlighter-rouge">asyncio</code> و <code class="highlighter-rouge">dataclasses</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>كيف تحصل عليه؟</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>شراء</strong>: متاح على Amazon و Packt.</li>
  <li><strong>مجاناً</strong>: قد تتمكن من الوصول إليه من خلال اشتراك Packt التجريبي أو العروض الترويجية.</li>

<p>هذا الكتاب ليس عن الأنماط المعمارية الكبيرة، بل عن الأنماط الصغيرة والأنيقة على مستوى الكود. إنه مجموعة من “الوصفات” التي توضح طرقًا ذكية وموجزة وفعالة لحل المشاكل اليومية الصغيرة بطريقة بايثونية.</p>

<p><strong>ماذا يكشف من أسرار الكبار؟</strong>
يكشف أن الأناقة تكمن في التفاصيل. كبار المطورين مهووسون بكتابة كود ليس فقط صحيحًا، بل جميلًا أيضًا. هذا الكتاب مليء بالتعابير الاصطلاحية (idioms) التي تجعل الكود أقصر وأكثر قابلية للقراءة. ستتعلم حيلًا لاستخدام <code class="highlighter-rouge">itertools</code>، و <code class="highlighter-rouge">collections</code>، و comprehensions بطرق لم تفكر بها من قبل.</p>

<p><strong>ميزات رئيسية</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>موجز ومباشر</strong>: كل وصفة هي حل لمشكلة صغيرة ومحددة.</li>
  <li><strong>تركيز على القراءة</strong>: يعلمك كيف تكتب كودًا يفهمه الآخرون بسهولة.</li>
  <li><strong>ممتع</strong>: قراءته ممتعة وتجعلك ترغب في تجربة هذه الحيل على الفور.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>كيف تحصل عليه؟</strong>:</p>

<p><strong>العنوان بالعربية</strong>: “أنماط التصميم في بايثون”
<strong>المؤلف</strong>: Alexander Shvets (ألكسندر شفيتس)</p>

<p>ما يميز هذا الكتاب هو بساطته وتركيزه البصري. إذا كانت الكتب الأخرى تبدو أكاديمية جدًا، فهذا الكتاب هو نقطة الدخول المثالية لعالم أنماط التصميم. يشرح كل نمط من أنماط GoF الـ 23 بمصطلحات بسيطة، ورسوم توضيحية واضحة، وأمثلة كود بايثون مباشرة.</p>

<p><strong>ماذا يكشف من أسرار الكبار؟</strong>
يكشف أن أنماط التصميم ليست مفاهيم مخيفة ومعقدة. إنها حلول منطقية لمشاكل شائعة. هذا الكتاب يزيل الغموض عن مصطلحات مثل “Singleton” و “Decorator” و “Visitor”، ويظهر لك أنها مجرد أسماء لأفكار ربما تكون قد استخدمتها بالفعل دون أن تعرف. إنه يمنحك المفردات اللازمة للتحدث عن تصميم البرمجيات بثقة.</p>

<p><strong>ميزات رئيسية</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>بصري للغاية</strong>: كل نمط مصحوب برسوم UML ومخططات توضح العلاقات.</li>
  <li><strong>سهل الفهم</strong>: اللغة بسيطة ومباشرة، وتتجنب المصطلحات المعقدة.</li>
  <li><strong>تفاعلي</strong>: الموقع المصاحب (<code class="highlighter-rouge">refactoring.guru</code>) يقدم نسخة تفاعلية من المحتوى.</li>

<p>I’m Aayush Gauba, a Django developer and Djangonaut Space mentee passionate about open source security and AI integration in web systems. I’ve spoken at DjangoCon US and actively contribute to the Django community through projects like AIWAF. My focus is on using technology to build safer and more inclusive ecosystems for developers worldwide.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, I’ve contributed to multiple areas of technology ranging from web development and AI security to research in quantum inspired computing. I’ve presented talks across these domains, including at DjangoCon US, where I spoke about AI powered web security and community driven innovation.
Beyond Django, I’ve published academic papers exploring the intersection of ethics, quantum AI, and neural architecture design presented at IEEE and other research venues. These experiences have helped me understand both the technical and philosophical challenges of building responsible and transparent technology.
As a Djangonaut Space mentee, I’ve been on the learning side of Django’s mentorship process and have seen firsthand how inclusive guidance and collaboration can empower new contributors. I bring a perspective that connects deep research with community growth and balancing innovation with the values that make Django strong: openness, ethics, and accessibility.</p>
<p>As part of the DSF board, I would like to bridge the gap between experienced contributors and new voices. I believe mentorship and accessibility are key to Django’s future. I would also like to encourage discussions around responsible AI integration, web security, and community growth ensuring Django continues to lead both technically and ethically. My goal is to help the DSF stay forward looking while staying true to its open, supportive roots.</p>

When not writing code, I'm probably playing pinball, watching a movie, or shouting into the void on social media.</p>
<p>I have been working with Django in production for over 10 years at The Motley Fool where I am a Staff Engineer. I have also participated in the Djangonauts program for my Django Unicorn library, gave a talk at DjangoCon EU (virtual) and multiple lightning talks at DjangoCon US conferences, built multiple libraries for Django and Python, have a semi-regularly updated podcast about Django with my friend, Sangeeta,  and just generally try to push the Django ecosystem forward in positive ways.</p>
<p>The key issue I would like to get involved with is updating the djangoproject.com website. The homepage itself hasn't changed substantially in over 10 years and I think Django could benefit from a fresh approach to selling itself to developers who are interested in a robust, stable web framework.

I actively organize and volunteer for community events around Django, Grafana, and Postgres. Professionally, I work as a software engineer at a startup, focusing on building scalable backend systems and developer tools. I’m also part of the Google Summer of Code working groups with Django and JdeRobot, contributing to mentorship and open source development for over four years.</p>
<p>I have been actively speaking at various tech communities including Python, FOSSASIA, Django, Grafana, and Postgres. Over time, I’ve gradually shifted from just speaking to also organizing and volunteering at these community events, helping others get involved and build connections around open source technologies.</p>
<p>Beyond work, I’ve been mentoring students through Google Summer of Code with Django and JdeRobot. I also teach high school students the fundamentals of Python, Django, and robotics, helping them build curiosity and confidence in programming from an early stage.</p>
<p>Last year, I joined the Accessibility Working Group of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which focuses on improving web accessibility standards and ensuring inclusive digital experiences for all users. My goal is to bring these learnings into the Django ecosystem, aligning its community and tools with global accessibility best practices.</p>
<p>Looking at the issues, I believe the opportunity of Google Summer of Code is currently very limited in Django. I know Django already has a lot of contributions, but being part of the core members in the JdeRobot organization, which is a small open source group, I understand the pain points we face when trying to reach that level of contribution. The way we utilize GSoC in JdeRobot has helped us grow, improve productivity, and bring in long-term contributors. I believe Django can benefit from adopting a similar approach.</p>
<p>Funding is another major issue faced by almost every open source organization. There are continuous needs around managing grants for conferences, supporting local communities and fellows, and sponsoring initiatives that strengthen the ecosystem. Finding sustainable ways to handle these challenges is something I want to focus on.</p>
<p>I also plan to promote Django across different open source programs. In my opinion, Django should not be limited to Python or Django-focused events. It can and should have a presence in database and infrastructure communities such as Postgres, Grafana, FOSSASIA, and W3C conferences around the world. This can help connect Django with new audiences and create more collaboration opportunities.</p></blockquote></details></section>

As a Microsoft MVP in the Developer Technologies category, an active DSF member and a leader in open source communities, I believe in the power of collaboration, documentation, and mentorship to unlock global impact.</p>
<p>My efforts focus on lowering the barriers to meaningful participation. My work sits at the intersection of production engineering, clear technical communication, and community building. I’ve spent years building ML production-ready systems with Django, FastAPI, Docker, cloud platforms, and also ensuring that the knowledge behind those systems is accessible to others. I’ve turned complex workflows into approachable, accessible guides and workshops that empower others to build confidently. I’ve also collaborated with global networks to promote ethical ML/AI and sustainable tech infrastructure in resource-constrained environments.</p>
<p>Through my extensive experience organizing major events like: DjangoCon Africa, UbuCon Africa, PyCon Africa, DjangoCon US, EuroPython, I’ve created inclusive spaces where underrepresented voices lead, thrive and are celebrated. This has equipped me with the skills and insights needed to drive inclusivity, sustainability and community engagement. I volunteer on both the DSF's CoC and the D&amp;I (as Chair) working groups.
I also contribute to the scientific community through projects like NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, the DISCOVER COOKBOOK (under NumFOCUS' DISC Program).</p>
<p>As the very first female Cameroonian to be awarded Microsoft MVP, this recognition reflects years of consistent contribution, technical excellence, and community impact. The program connects me with a global network that I actively leverage to bring visibility, resources, and opportunities back to Django and Python communities, bridging local initiatives with global platforms to amplify Django’s reach and relevance. It demonstrates that my work is recognized at the highest levels of the industry.</p>
<p>As a young Black African woman in STEM from a region of Africa with pretty limited resources and an active DSF member, I’ve dedicated my career to fostering inclusivity and representation in the tech and scientific spaces and I am confident that I bring a unique perspective to the table. </p>
<p>I will push the DSF to be more than a steward of code, to be a catalyst for global belonging. My priorities are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Radical inclusion: I'll work to expand resources and support for contributors from underrepresented regions, especially in Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia. This includes funding for local events, mentorship pipelines, and multilingual documentation sprints.</li>
<li>Sustainable community infrastructure: I’ll advocate for sustainable models of community leadership, ones that recognize invisible labor, prevent burnout, and promote distributed governance. We need to rethink how we support organizers, maintainers, and contributors beyond code.</li>
<li>Ethical tech advocacy: I’ll help the DSF navigate the ethical dimensions of Django’s growing role in AI and data-driven systems. From privacy to fairness, Django can lead by example. And I’ll work to ensure our framework reflects our values.</li>
<li>Global partnerships: I want to strengthen partnerships with regional communities and allied open-source foundations, ensuring Django’s growth is global and socially conscious. </li>
</ul>
<p>I will bring diversity, a young and energized spirit that I think most senior boards lack.
My vision is for the DSF to not only maintain Django but to set the standard for inclusive, ethical, and sustainable open source.
My goal is simple: to make Django the most welcoming, resilient, and socially conscious web framework in the world.</p></blockquote></details></section>

<p>I would want to get involved more on the community side, diversity in terms of regional presentation and awareness of Django, and the Django Software Foundation. In as much as they's a lot of efforts in place. With no available African entity of the DSF, this would make it difficult for companies/organization in Africa to donate and support the DSF, I would love to champion for that and pioner towards that direction, not only for Africa but also for other under-represented geographical areas.</p>
<p>I wasn't so sure about this last year, but I am more confident, with a better understanding of the Django ecosystem and I know I have the capabilities of getting more contributions to Django, both financially and code-wise. I would also love to make sure that Django and the ecosystem is well know through proper communication channels, I know this differs based on different countries, the goal is to make sure that the DSF is all over, of course, where we are needed.

I re-joined the DSF board in 2023, and have served as Treasurer since 2024. I used to be a software engineer and security consultant (REVSYS, Latacora, 18F, Heroku), before mostly retiring from tech in 2025 to become an EMT.</p>
<p>I've been a member of the DSF Board for 3 years, so I bring some institutional knowledge there. I've been involved in the broader Django community as long as there has been a Django community, though the level of my involvement has waxed and waned. The accomplishments I'm the most proud of in the Django community are creating our Code of Conduct (<a href="https://djangoproject.com/conduct/" rel="ugc">djangoproject.com/conduct/</a>), and more recently establishing the DSF's Working Groups model (<a href="https://github.com/django/dsf-working-groups/" rel="ugc">django/dsf-working-groups</a>).</p>
<p>Outside of the Django community, I have about 15 years of management experience, at companies small and large (and also in the US federal government).</p>
<p>I'm running for re-election with three goals for the DSF: (a) hire an Executive Director, (b) build more &quot;&quot;onramps&quot;&quot; into the DSF and Django community, and (c) expand and update our Grants program.</p>
<p>Hire an ED: this is my main goal for 2026, and the major reason I'm running for re-election. The DSF has grown past the point where being entirely volunteer-ran is working; we need transition the organization towards a more professional non-profit operation. Which means paid staff. Members of the Board worked on this all throughout 2025, mostly behind the scenes, and we're closer than ever -- but not quite there. We need to make this happen in 2026.</p>
<p>Build &quot;&quot;onramps&quot;&quot;: this was my main goal when I ran in 2024 (see my statement at <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2023/nov/13/2024-dsf-board-candidates/" rel="ugc">2024 DSF Board Candidates</a>). We've had some success there: several Working Groups are up and running, and over on the technical side we helped the Steering Council navigate a tricky transition, and they're now headed in a more positive direction. I'm happy with our success there, but there's still work to do; helping more people get involved with the DSF and Django would continue to be a high-level goal of mine. And, I'd like to build better systems for recognition of people who contribute to the DSF/Django — there are some incredible people working behind the scenes that most of the community has heard of.</p>
<p>Expand and update our grants program: our grants program is heavily overdue for a refresh. I'd like to update our rules and policies, make funding decisions clearer and less ad-hoc, increase the amount of money we're giving per grant, and (funding allowing) expand to to other kinds of grants (e.g. travel grants, feature grants, and more). I'd also like to explore turning over grant decisions to a Working Group (or subcommittee of the board), to free up Board time for more strategic work.</p></blockquote></details></section>

<p>My experience as Opportunity Grant Co-Chair for DjangoCon US and Design Lead for PyCon Africa has shown me how powerful community-driven support can be when it’s backed by inclusion and transparency. I want the DSF to continue building bridges between developers, organizers, and contributors  making sure that everyone, regardless of location or background, feels seen and supported.</p>
<p>I believe the DSF can take a more active role in empowering local communities, improving mentorship pathways, and creating better visibility for contributors who work behind the scenes. I also want to support initiatives that make Django more approachable to new developers through clearer learning materials and global outreach programs.</p>
<p>Personally, I want to help the DSF improve communication with international communities, expand partnerships with educational programs and tech organizations, and ensure the next generation of developers see Django as not just a framework, but a welcoming and sustainable ecosystem.</p>
<p>My direction for leadership is guided by collaboration, empathy, and practical action building on Django’s strong foundation while helping it evolve for the future</p></blockquote></details></section>

I’ve collaborated across India, UK, and Canada, so I’m used to async work, time-zones, and transparent communication.</p>
<p>I owe my learnings to the community and want to give back. I understand the DSF Board is non-technical leadership like fundraising, grants/sponsorships, community programs, CoC support, and stewardship of Django’s operations and not deciding framework features. That’s exactly where I want to contribute.</p>
<p>I’ll push for an easy, skimmable annual “Where your donation went” report (fellows, events, grants, infra) plus lightweight quarterly updates. Clear storytelling helps retain individual and corporate sponsors and shows impact beyond core commits.</p>
<p>I want to grow contributors globally by turning their first PR into regular contributions. I want to make this path smoother by funding micro-grants for mentorship/sprints and backing working groups with small, delegated budgets under clear guardrails - so they can move fast without waiting on the Board.</p>
<p>I propose a ready-to-use “starter kit” for meetups/sprints: budget templates, venue ask letters, CoC, diversity travel-grant boilerplates, and a sponsor prospectus. We should prioritize regions with high Django usage but fewer historic DSF touchpoints (South Asia, Africa, LATAM). This comes directly from organizing over 120 meetups and annual conference like PyCon India for 3 years.</p></blockquote></details></section>

the main goals of the game is to collect “<a href="https://www.pikminwiki.com/Decor_Pikmin">decor Pikmin</a>” which can
come from the environment, landmarks, and businesses that you walk by.
Recently there's been a change to the game that makes completing sets
of decor Pikmin <strong>significantly more difficult</strong>, this post
explores the new difficulty increase.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Every month there are <a href="https://www.pikminwiki.com/Special_Decor_Pikmin">special decor Pikmin</a> which are earned by completing
challenges like walking, growing Pikmin, or planting flowers. The type of Pikmin
you receive is randomized between the available types, and you can only complete
the set by collecting one of <a href="https://www.pikminwiki.com/Pikmin_family">each available Pikmin type</a>. You can only
receive these special decors during the specific month, after the month is
over you have to wait a calendar year before you can continue collecting seedlings.</p>

<p>Just a few days ago there were 7 Pikmin types corresponding to the
first three mainline Pikmin games: Red, Yellow, Blue, White, Purple, Rock, and Wing Pikmin.
With the most recent update another Pikmin type has been added: <a href="https://pikminbloom.com/en/news/nov25-icepikmin-welcome">Ice Pikmin from Pikmin 4</a>.
This means that going forward there will be 8 Pikmin types per event decor set
instead of only 7.</p>

<p><strong>So, what does that mean for the difficulty of the game?</strong>
I could probably do some math here, but it'd be much easier to simulate how
many event Pikmin you'd need to receive before completing the set depending
on if there are 7 or 8 total Pikmin types.</p>

<p>Running this <a href="https://gist.github.com/sethmlarson/e0ec72671b2362d9da4090121750179e">Python simulation script</a> creates the below table which shows the difference in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_distribution_function">cumulative
probability</a> for completing a decor set after receiving a number of Pikmin seedlings. For example,
if you have grown 10 seedlings you'd have a <strong>10.5% chance</strong> of completing the decor set
<strong>before Ice Pikmin</strong> and only a <strong>2.8% chance</strong> of completing the decor set <strong>after Ice Pikmin</strong>.</p>

<p>For mid-range numbers of Pikmin seedlings (13-22)
you'll be at <strong>least 15% less likely</strong> to have completed the Pikmin decor set
for that number of seedlings. To have a 95% chance of completing a decor set
you'd need to gather 32 seedlings prior to Ice Pikmin, with Ice Pikmin you'd
need to collect 38 seedlings.</p>

<p>I don't know how many event Pikmin seedlings I receive in a typical month,
I'll be watching that number and see if I'm able to complete the set. Good luck out there, Pikmin players! 😬</p>

            <p>Most Python objects store their attributes in a <code>__dict__</code> dictionary. Modules and classes always use <code>__dict__</code>, but not everything does.</p>

    <h2>How are class attributes stored by default?</h2>
    
      
        <p>Here we have a class called <code>Point</code> in a <code>points.py</code> file:</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Point</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="fm">__init__</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">z</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">y</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">z</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">z</span><span class="p">)</span>


<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">point_path_from_file</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">filename</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">with</span> <span class="nb">open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">filename</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">lines</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="p">[</span>
            <span class="n">Point</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="nb">map</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">float</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">point_line</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">split</span><span class="p">()))</span>
            <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">point_line</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">lines</span>
        <span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>And here's an instance of this <code>Point</code> class:</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">p</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Point</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>Normally, classes store their attributes in a <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/using-dictionaries-in-python/" target="_blank">dictionary</a> called <code>__dict__</code>.</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">p</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="vm">__dict__</span>
<span class="go">{'x': 1, 'y': 2, 'z': 3}</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>We have a class here where every instance has <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>z</code> attributes.
But we could add other attributes to any instance of this <code>Point</code> class, and another key-value pair will appear in this <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/where-are-attributes-stored/" target="_blank"><code>__dict__</code></a> dictionary.</p>

      
        <p>For example if we add a <code>w</code> attribute:</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">p</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">w</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">4</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>Our <code>__dict__</code> dictionary will now have a <code>w</code> attribute:</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">p</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="vm">__dict__</span>
<span class="go">{'x': 1, 'y': 2, 'z': 3, 'w': 4}</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>This is how classes work <em>by default</em>; classes work this way <strong>unless you use <code>__slots__</code></strong>.</p>
