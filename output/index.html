            <p>The <a href="http://python.org/psf" target="_blank">Python Software Foundation</a> (PSF) is the charitable organization behind Python, dedicated to advancing, supporting, and protecting the Python programming language and the community that sustains it. That mission and cause are more than just words we believe in. Our tiny but mighty team works hard to deliver the projects and services that allow Python to be the thriving, independent, community-driven language it is today. Some of what the PSF does includes producing <a href="https://us.pycon.org" target="_blank">PyCon US</a>, hosting the <a href="http://pypi.org" target="_blank">Python Package Index (PyPI)</a>, supporting <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/developersinresidence/" target="_blank">5 Developers-in-Residence</a>, <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/about/" target="_blank">maintaining critical community infrastructure</a>, and more.<br /><br />Python is for teaching, learning, playing, researching, exploring, creating, working– the list goes on and on and on! Support this year's fundraiser with your donations and memberships to help the PSF, the Python community, and the language stay strong and sustainable. <b>Because Python is for everyone, thanks to you.<br /><br /></b></p><h3 style="text-align: left;">There are two direct ways to join through <a href="http://donate.python.org">donate.python.org</a>:&nbsp;</h3><ul style="text-align: left;"><li><b>Donate directly to the PSF!</b> Your donation is a direct way to support and power the future of the Python programming language and community you love.

Lawrence Convention Center in beautiful downtown Pittsburgh. PyCon US 2025 was packed with 9 days of content, education, and networking for the Python community, including 6 Keynote Sessions, 91 Talks, including the Charlas Spanish track, 24 Tutorials, 20 Posters, 30+ Sprint Projects, 146 Open Spaces, and 60 Booths!&nbsp;</li><li><b>Continuing to enhance Python and PyPI’s security through Developers-in-Residence:</b> The PSF’s PyPI Safety and Security Engineer, Mike Fiedler, has implemented new safeguards, including automation to detect expiring email domains and prevent impersonation attacks, as well as guidance for maintainers to use more secure authentication methods like WebAuthn and Trusted Publishers. The PSF’s Security Developer-in-Residence, Seth Larson, continues to lead efforts to strengthen Python’s security and transparency. His work on PEP 770 introduces standardized Software Bill-of-Materials (SBOMs) within Python packages, improving visibility into dependencies for stronger supply chain security. A <a href="https://alpha-omega.dev/blog/slippery-zips-and-sticky-tar-pits-security-and-archives-white-paper-by-seth-larson-python-software-foundation/" target="_blank">new white paper co-authored with Alpha-Omega</a> outlines how these improvements enhance trust and measurability across the ecosystem.&nbsp;</li><li><b>Adoption of <a href="http://pypistats.org">pypistats.org</a>:</b> The <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2025/08/pypistats-org-is-now-operated-by-the-psf.html" target="_blank">PSF infrastructure team has officially adopted the operation of pypistats.org</a>, which had been run by volunteer Christopher Flynn for over six years (thank you, Christopher!). The PSF’s Infrastructure Team now handles the service’s infrastructure, costs, and domain registration– and the service itself remains open source and community-maintained.&nbsp;</li><li><b>Advancing PyPI Organizations:</b> The rollout of <a href="https://docs.pypi.org/organization-accounts/" target="_blank">PyPI Organizations</a> is now well underway, marking a major milestone in improving project management and collaboration across the Python ecosystem. With new Terms of Service finalized and supporting tools in place, the PSF has cleared its backlog of requests and approved thousands of organizations—including 2,409 Community and 4979 Company organizations as of today. Hundreds of these organizations have already begun adding members, transferring projects, and subscribing to the new Company tier, generating sustainable support for the PSF. We’re excited to see how teams are using these new features to better organize and maintain their projects on PyPI.</li><li><b>Empowering the Python community through Fiscal Sponsorship:</b> We are proud to continue supporting our 20 fiscal sponsoree organizations with their initiatives and events all year round. The PSF provides 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status to fiscal sponsorees such as PyLadies and Pallets, and provides back office support so they can focus on their missions. Consider <a href="https://linktr.ee/thepsf" target="_blank">donating to your favorite PSF Fiscal Sponsoree</a> and check out our <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/fiscal-sponsorees/" target="_blank">Fiscal Sponsorees page</a> to learn more about what each of these awesome organizations is all about!</li><li><b>Serving our community with grants:</b> The PSF Grants Program awarded approximately $340K to 86 grantees around the world; supporting local conferences, workshops, and community initiatives that keep Python growing and accessible to all. While we had to make <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2025/08/the-psf-has-paused-our-grants-program.html" target="_blank">the difficult decision to pause the program early</a> to ensure financial sustainability, we would love to reopen it as soon as possible. Your participation in this year’s fundraiser fuels that effort!</li><li><b>Honoring community leaders:</b> The PSF honored three leaders with Distinguished Service Awards this year. <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2025/03/psf-dsa-ewa-jodlowska.html" target="_blank">Ewa Jodlowska</a> helped transform the PSF into a professional, globally supportive organization. <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2025/03/dsa-thomas-wouters.html" target="_blank">Thomas Wouters</a> has contributed decades of leadership, guidance, and institutional knowledge. <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2025/03/dsa-van-lindberg.html" target="_blank">Van Lindberg</a> provided essential legal expertise that guided the PSF through growth and governance. Their dedication has left a lasting impact on the PSF, Python, and its community.&nbsp;The PSF was also thrilled to recognize <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2025/10/announcing-psf-community-service-award.html" target="_blank">Katie McLaughlin, Sarah Kuchinsky, and Rodrigo Girão Serrão with Community Service Awards</a>&nbsp;(CSA) for their outstanding contributions to the Python community. Their dedication, creativity, and generosity embody the spirit of Python and strengthen our global community.&nbsp;We recognized Jay Miller with a CSA for his work to improve diversity, inclusion, and equity in the global Python community through founding and sustaining Black Python Devs. We also honored Matt Lebrun and Micaela Reyes with CSA's for their efforts to grow and support the Python community in the Philippines through conferences, meetups, and volunteer programs.</li><li><b>Finding strength in the Python community:</b> When the PSF shared <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2025/10/NSF-funding-statement.html" target="_blank">the news about turning down a NSF grant</a>, the outpouring of support from the Python community was nothing short of incredible. In just one day, you helped raise over $60K and welcomed 125 new Supporting Members- in the week after, that number jumped to $150K+ and 270+ new Supporting Members! A community-led matching campaign and countless messages of support, solidarity, and encouragement reminded us that while some choices are tough, we never face them alone. The PSF Board &amp; Staff are deeply moved and energized by your words, actions, and continued belief in our shared mission. This moment has set the stage for a record-breaking end-of-year fundraiser, and we are so incredibly grateful to be in community with each of you.&nbsp;</li></ul>

    <h2>Parentheses can be used for grouping</h2>
    
      
        <p>Parentheses are used for 3 things in Python: <strong>calling callables</strong>, <strong>creating empty tuples</strong>, and <strong>grouping</strong>.</p>

      
        <p>Functions, classes, and other [callable][] objects can be called with parentheses:</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"I'm calling a function"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">I'm calling a function</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>Empty tuples can be created with parentheses:</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">empty</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">()</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>Lastly, parentheses can be used for <strong>grouping</strong>:</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="mi">3</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">4</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">7</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">33</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>Sometimes parentheses are <em>necessary</em> to convey the order of execution for an expression.
For example, <code>3 * (4 + 7)</code> is different than <code>3 * 4 + 7</code>:</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="mi">3</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">4</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">7</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">33</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="mi">3</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">4</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">7</span>
<span class="go">19</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>Those parentheses around <code>4 + 7</code> are for grouping that sub-expression, which changes the meaning of the larger expression.</p>

      
        <p>All confusing and unnecessary uses of parentheses are caused by this third use: <strong>grouping parentheses</strong>.</p>

            <p>Happy 6-year blogiversary to me! 🎉 To celebrate
I want to talk about <em>other peoples’ blogs</em>, more specifically
the magic of “<a href="https://indieweb.org/blogroll">blogrolls</a>”.
Blogrolls are “lists of other sites that you read, are a follower of, or recommend”.
Any blog can host a blogroll, or sometimes websites can be <a href="https://blogroll.org/">one big blogroll</a>.
<!-- more --></p>

<p>I’ve hosted a <a href="https://sethmlarson.dev/blogroll">blogroll</a> on my own blog <a href="https://github.com/sethmlarson/sethmlarson.dev/commit/bb1878ed81db05d194d350e108176241f339362e">since 2023</a>
and encourage other bloggers to do so. My own blogroll is <a href="https://github.com/sethmlarson/sethmlarson.dev/tree/main/archive">generated</a> from the list of RSS
feeds I subscribe to and articles that I “favorite” within <a href="https://inoreader.com">my RSS reader</a>.
If you want to be particularly fancy you can add an RSS feed (<a href="https://henry.codes/recent-reading/">example</a>) to your blogroll
that provides readers a method to “subscribe” for future blogroll updates.</p>

<p>Blogrolls are like catnip for me: I cannot resist opening and <code>Ctrl</code>-clicking
every link until I can’t see my tabs anymore. The feeling is akin to the first deep breath
of air before starting a hike: there’s a rush of new information, topics, and potential new blogs
to follow.</p>

<p>Blogrolls can bridge the “effort chasm” I frequently
hear as an issue when I recommend folks try an RSS feed reader. We’re not used to
empty feeds anymore; self-curating blogs until you receive multiple articles
per day takes time and effort. Blogrolls can help here, especially ones that
publish using the importable <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sethmlarson/sethmlarson.dev/refs/heads/main/archive/feeds.opml">OPML format</a>.</p>

<p>You can instantly populate your feed reader app with hundreds of feeds
from blogs that are likely relevant to you. Simply create an account on
a feed reader, <a href="https://www.inoreader.com/blog/2014/05/opml-subscriptions.html">import the blogroll OPML document</a> from a blogger you enjoy,
and watch the articles “roll” in. Blogrolls are almost like Bluesky
“Starter Packs” in this way!</p>

<p>Hopefully this has convinced you to either curate your own blogroll
or to start looking for (or asking for!) blogrolls from your favorite
writers on the Web. Share your favorite blogroll with me on email or social media.

<ul>
<li>Rich-powered CLI that breaks each HTTP request into DNS, connect, TLS, wait, and transfer phases with waterfall timelines, compact summaries, or metrics-only output.</li>
<li>Features
<ul>
<li><strong>Phase-by-phase timing</strong> – precise measurements built from httpcore trace hooks (with sane fallbacks when metal-level data is unavailable).</li>
<li><strong>All HTTP methods</strong> – GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, HEAD, OPTIONS with request body support.</li>
<li><strong>Request body support</strong> – send JSON, XML, or any data inline or from file with automatic Content-Type detection.</li>
<li><strong>IPv4/IPv6 aware</strong> – the resolver and TLS inspector report both the address and its family.</li>
<li><strong>TLS insights</strong> – certificate CN, expiry countdown, cipher suite, and protocol version are captured automatically.</li>
<li><strong>Multiple output modes</strong> – rich waterfall view, compact single-line summaries, or <code>-metrics-only</code> for scripting.</li>
<li><strong>JSON export</strong> – persist full step data (including redirect chains) for later processing.</li>
<li><strong>Extensible</strong> – clean Protocol interfaces for DNS, TLS, timing, visualization, and export so you can plug in custom behavior.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Example:</li>

<ul>
<li>Use math functions instead of operators</li>
<li>Avoid exception handling in hot loops</li>
<li>Use itertools for combinatorial operations - huge speedup</li>

<li>Features
<ul>
<li>🗣️ Automatic Voice Detection and Turn Taking built-in, only worry about the logic for responding to the user.</li>
<li>💻 Automatic UI - Use the <code>.ui.launch()</code> method to launch the webRTC-enabled built-in Gradio UI.</li>
<li>🔌 Automatic WebRTC Support - Use the <code>.mount(app)</code> method to mount the stream on a FastAPI app and get a webRTC endpoint for your own frontend!</li>
<li>⚡️ Websocket Support - Use the <code>.mount(app)</code> method to mount the stream on a FastAPI app and get a websocket endpoint for your own frontend!</li>
<li>📞 Automatic Telephone Support - Use the <code>fastphone()</code> method of the stream to launch the application and get a free temporary phone number!</li>
<li>🤖 Completely customizable backend - A <code>Stream</code> can easily be mounted on a FastAPI app so you can easily extend it to fit your production application. See the <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/fastrtc/talk-to-claude?featured_on=pythonbytes">Talk To Claude</a> demo for an example of how to serve a custom JS frontend.</li>

            <p>Sometimes you just want to know about your dependencies, and their dependencies.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using <code>pipdeptree</code> for a while, but recently switched to <code>uv pip tree</code>.<br />
Let&rsquo;s take a look at both tools.</p>
<h2 id="pipdeptree">pipdeptree</h2>
<p><code>pipdeptree</code> is pip installable, but I don&rsquo;t want <code>pipdeptree</code> itself to be reported alongside everything else installed, so I usually install it outside of a project. We can use it system wide by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Installing with <code>uv tool install pipdeptree</code>.
<ul>
<li>Then running with <code>pipdeptree --python auto</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Running without installing with <code>uvx pipdeptree --python auto</code></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="usage">usage</h3>
<p>The <code>--python auto</code> tells <code>pipdeptree</code> to look at the current environment.</p>

            Today we’re digging into the Model Context Protocol, or MCP. Think LSP for AI: build a small Python service once and your tools and data show up across editors and agents like VS Code, Claude Code, and more. My guest, Den Delimarsky from Microsoft, helps build this space and will keep us honest about what’s solid versus what's just shiny. We’ll keep it practical: transports that actually work, guardrails you can trust, and a tiny server you could ship this week. By the end, you’ll have a clear mental model and a path to plug Python into the internet of agents.

            <p>It&#8217;s been a busy, bumpy week with coverage.py. Some things did not go
smoothly, and I didn&#8217;t handle everything as well as I could have.</p><p>It started with trying to fix <a href="https://github.com/coveragepy/coveragepy/issues/2064" rel="external noopener">issue 2064</a> about
conflicts between the &#8220;sysmon&#8221; measurement core and a concurrency setting.</p><p>To measure your code, coverage.py needs to know what code got executed. To
know that, it collects execution events from the Python interpreter. CPython now
has two mechanisms for this: trace functions and sys.monitoring.  Coverage.py
has two implementations of a trace function (in C and in Python), and an
implementation of a sys.monitoring listener.  These three components are the
measurement cores, known as &#8220;ctrace&#8221;, &#8220;pytrace&#8221;, and &#8220;sysmon&#8221;.</p><p>The fastest is sysmon, but there are coverage.py features it doesn&#8217;t yet
support.  With Python 3.14, sysmon is the default core.  Issue 2064 complained
that when the defaulted core conflicted with an explicit concurrency choice, the
conflict resulted in an error.  I agreed with the issue: since the core was
defaulted, it shouldn&#8217;t be an error, we should choose a different core.</p><p>But I figured if you explicitly asked for the sysmon core and also a
conflicting setting, that should be an error because you&#8217;ve got two settings
that can&#8217;t be used together.</p><p>Implementing all that got a little involved because of &#8220;metacov&#8221;: coverage.py
coverage-measuring itself.  The sys.monitoring facility in Python was added in
3.12, but wasn&#8217;t fully fleshed out enough to do branch coverage until 3.14. When
we measure ourselves, we use branch coverage, so 3.12 and 3.13 needed some
special handling to avoid causing the error that sysmon plus branch coverage
would cause.</p><p>I got it all done, and <a href="https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/7.11.3/changes.html#version-7-11-1-2025-11-07" rel="external noopener">released 7.11.1</a> on Friday.</p><p>Soon, <a href="https://github.com/coveragepy/coveragepy/issues/2077" rel="external noopener">issue 2077</a> arrived. Another fix in 7.11.1
involved some missing branches when using the sysmon core.  That fix required
parsing the source code during execution.  But sometimes the &#8220;code&#8221; can&#8217;t be
parsed: Jinja templates compile html files to Python and use the html file as
the file name for the code. When coverage.py tries to parse the html file as
Python, of course it fails. My fix didn&#8217;t account for this.  I fixed that on
Saturday and <a href="https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/7.11.3/changes.html#version-7-11-2-2025-11-08" rel="external noopener">released 7.11.2</a>.</p><p>In the meantime, <a href="https://github.com/coveragepy/coveragepy/issues/2076" rel="external noopener">issue 2076</a> and <a href="https://github.com/coveragepy/coveragepy/issues/2078" rel="external noopener">issue
2078</a> both pointed out that now some settings combinations that used to
produce warnings now produced errors. This is a breaking change, they said, and
should not have been released as a patch version.</p><p>To be honest, my first reaction was that it wasn&#8217;t that big a deal, the
settings were in conflict. Fix the settings and all will be well.  It&#8217;s hard to
remember all of the possibilities when making changes like this, it&#8217;s easy to
make mistakes, and semantic versioning is bound to have judgement calls anyway.
I had already spent a while getting 7.11.1 done, and .2 followed just a day
later. I was annoyed and didn&#8217;t want to have to re-think everything.</p><p>But the more I thought about it, I decided they were right: it does break
pipelines that used to work.  And falling back to a different core is fine: the
cores differ in speed and compatibility but (for the most part) produce the same
results. Changing the requested core with a warning is a fine way to deal with
the settings conflict without stopping test suites from running.</p><p>So I just <a href="https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/7.11.3/changes.html#version-7-11-3-2025-11-09" rel="external noopener">released 7.11.3</a> to go back to the older
behavior. Maybe I won&#8217;t have to do another release tomorrow!</p><p>While all this was going on, I also moved the code from my personal GitHub
account to a new <a href="https://github.com/coveragepy" rel="external noopener">coveragepy GitHub
organization</a>!</p><p>Coverage.py is basically a one-man show. Maybe the GitHub organization will
make others feel more comfortable chiming in, but I doubt it. I&#8217;d like to have
more people to talk through changes with.  Maybe I wouldn&#8217;t have had to make
three releases in three days if someone else had been around as a sounding
board.</p><p>I&#8217;m in the <a href="https://discord.gg/RBw567RyWc" rel="external noopener">#coverage-py</a> channel if you want to talk
about any aspect of coverage.py, or I can be reached in
<a href="https://nedbatchelder.com/site/aboutned.html">lots of other ways</a>. I&#8217;d love to talk to
you.</p>

            <p>I’ve recently migrated my VPS from Fedora to Ubuntu. Here’s a list of things that might be useful to keep in mind before, during, and after a migration of a server that hosts publicly accessible Web sites and applications, as well as other personal services, and how to get rid of the most annoying parts of Ubuntu.</p>
<!-- TEASER_END -->

<h2>Why switch?</h2>
<p>Fedora is a relatively popular distro, so it’s well supported by software vendors. Its packagers adopt a no-nonsense approach, making very little changes that deviate from the upstream.</p>
<p>Ubuntu is not my favorite distro, far from it. While it is perhaps the most popular distro out there, its packages contain many more patches compared to Fedora, and Canonical (the company behind Ubuntu) are famous for betting on the wrong horse (Unity, upstart, Mir…). But one thing Ubuntu does well is stability. Fedora makes releases every 6 months, and those releases are supported for just 13 months, which means upgrading at least every year. Every upgrade may introduce incompatibilities, almost every upgrade requires recreating Python venvs. That gets boring fast, and it does not necessarily bring benefits. Granted, the Fedora system upgrade works quite well, and I upgraded through at least eight releases without a re-install, but I would still prefer to avoid it. That’s why I went with Ubuntu LTS, which is supported for five years, with a new release every two years, but which still comes with reasonably new software (and with many third-party repositories if something is missing or outdated).</p>
<h2>Test your backups</h2>
<p>I have a backup “system” that’s a bunch of Bash scripts. After upgrading one of the services that is being backed up, the responsible script started crashing, and thus backups stopped working. Another thing that broke was e-mails from cron, so I didn’t know anything was wrong.</p>
<p>While I do have full disk backups enabled at <a href="https://hetzner.cloud/?ref=Qy1lehF8PwzP">Hetzner</a> <em>(disclaimer: referral link)</em>, my custom backups are more fine-grained (e.g. important configuration files, database dumps, package lists), so they are quite useful in migrating between OSes.</p>
<p>So, here’s a reminder not only to test your backups regularly, but also to make sure they are being created at all, and to make sure cron can send you logs somewhere you can see them.</p>
<p>Bonus cron tip: set <code>MAILFROM=</code> and <code>MAILTO=</code> in your crontab if your SMTP server does not like the values cron uses by default.</p>
<h2>Think about IP address reassignment (or pray to the DNS gods)</h2>
<p>A new VPS or cloud server probably means a new IP address. But if you get a new IP address, that might complicate the migration of your publicly accessible applications. If you’re proxying all your Web properties through Cloudflare or something similar, that’s probably not an issue. But if you have a raw A record somewhere, things can get complicated. DNS servers and operating systems do a lot of caching. The conventional wisdom is to wait 24 or even 48 hours after changing DNS values. This might be true if your TTL is set to a long value, but if your TTL is short, the only worry are DNS servers that ignore TTL values and cache records for longer. If you plan a migration, it’s good to check your TTL well in advance, and not worry too much about broken DNS servers.</p>
<p>But you might not need a new IP. Carefully review your cloud provider’s IP management options before making any changes. Hetzner is more flexible than other hosts in this regard, as it is possible to <a href="https://docs.hetzner.com/cloud/servers/primary-ips/faq">move primary public IP addresses (not “floating” or “elastic” IPs) between servers</a>, as long as you’re okay with a few minutes’ downtime (you will need to shut down the source and destination servers).</p>
<p>If you’re not okay with any downtime, you would probably want to leverage the floating/elastic IP feature, or hope DNS propagates quickly enough.</p>
<h2>Trim the fat</h2>
<p>My VPS ran a lot of services I don’t need anymore, but never really got around to decommissioning. For example, I had a full Xfce install with VNC access (the VNC server was only running when needed). I haven’t actually used the desktop for ages, so I just dropped it.</p>
<p>I also had an OpenVPN setup. It was useful years ago, when mobile data allowances were much smaller and speeds much worse. These days, I don’t use public WiFi networks at all, unless I’m going abroad, and I just buy one month of <a href="https://mullvad.net/">Mullvad VPN</a> for €5 whenever that happens. So, add another service to the “do not migrate” list.</p>
<p>One thing that I could not just remove was the e-mail server. Many years ago, I ran a reasonably functional e-mail server on my VPS. I’ve since then migrated to <a href="https://www.zoho.com/mail/">Zoho Mail</a> (which costs €10.80/year), in part due to IP reputation issues after changing hosting providers, and also to avoid having to fight spam. When I did that, I kept Postfix around, but as a local server for things like cron or Django to send e-mail with, and I configured it to send all e-mails via Zoho. But I did not really want to move over all the configuration, hoping that Ubuntu’s Postfix packages can work with my hacked together config from Fedora. So I replaced the server with <a href="https://www.opensmtpd.org/">OpenSMTPD</a> (from the OpenBSD project), and all the Postfix configuration files with just one short configuration file:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">table aliases file:/etc/aliases
table secrets file:/etc/mail-secrets

listen on localhost
listen on 172.17.0.1 # Docker

action "relay" relay host smtp+tls://smtp@smtp.example.net:587 auth &lt;secrets&gt; mail-from "@example.com"

match from any for any action "relay"
</pre></div>

<h2>Dockerize everything…</h2>
<p>My server runs a few different apps, some of which are exposed on the public Internet, while some do useful work in the background. The services I have set up most recently are containerized with the help of Docker. The only Docker-based service that was stateful (and did not just use folders mounted as volumes) was a MariaDB database. Migrating that is straightforward with a simple dump-and-restore.</p>
<p>Of course, not everything on my server is in Docker. The public-facing nginx install isn’t, and neither is PostgreSQL (but that was also a quick dump-and-restore migration with some extra steps).</p>
<h2>…especially Python</h2>
<p>But then, there are the Python apps. Python the language is cool (if a little slow), but the packaging story is a <a href="https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2023/01/15/how-to-improve-python-packaging/">total</a> dumpster <a href="https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2024/01/15/python-packaging-one-year-later/">fire</a>.</p>
<p>By the way, here’s a quick recap of 2024/2025 in Python packaging: the most hyped Python package manager (<code>uv</code>) is written in Rust, which screams “Python is a toy language in which you can’t even write a tool as simple as a package manager”. (I know, dependency resolution is computationally expensive, so doing <em>that</em> in Rust makes sense, but everything else could easily be done in pure Python. And no, the package manager should not manage Python installs.) Of course, almost all the other contenders listed in my 2023 post are still being developed. On the standards front, the community finally produced a lockfile standard after years of discussions.</p>
<p>Anyway, I have three Python apps. One of them is <a href="https://isso-comments.de/">Isso</a>, which is providing the comments box below this post. I used to run a modified version of Isso a long time ago, but I don’t need to anymore. I looked at the docs, and they offer <a href="https://isso-comments.de/docs/reference/installation/#using-docker">a pre-built Docker image</a>, which means I could just quickly deploy it on my server with Docker and skip the pain of managing Python environments.</p>
<p>The other two apps are Django projects built by yours truly. They are not containerized, they exist in venvs created using the system Python. Moving venvs between machines is generally impossible, so I had to re-create them. Of course, I hit a deprecation, because the Python maintainers (especially in the packaging world) does not understand their responsibility as maintainers of the most popular programming language. This time, it was caused by <a href="https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11457">an old editable install with setuptools (using setup.py develop, not PEP 660)</a>, and installs with more recent pip/setuptools versions would not have this error… although <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/do-we-want-to-keep-the-build-system-default-for-pyproject-toml/104759">some people want to remove the fallback to setuptools if there is no pyproject.toml</a>, so you need to stay up to date with the whims of the Python packaging industry if you want to use Python software.</p>
<h2>Don’t bother with ufw</h2>
<p>Ubuntu ships with <code>ufw</code>, the “uncomplicated firewall”, in the default install. I was previously using <code>firewalld</code>, a Red Hat-adjacent project, but I decided to give ufw a try. Since if it’s part of the default install, it might be supported better by the system.</p>
<p>It turns out that Docker and ufw <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/network/packet-filtering-firewalls/#docker-and-ufw">don’t play together</a>. <a href="https://github.com/chaifeng/ufw-docker?tab=readme-ov-file#solving-ufw-and-docker-issues">Someone has built a set of rules that are supposed to fix it</a>, but that did not work for me.</p>
<p>Docker <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/network/packet-filtering-firewalls/#integration-with-firewalld">does integrate with firewalld</a>, and Ubuntu has packages for it, so I just installed it, enabled the services that need to be publicly available and things were working again.</p>
<h2>Kill the ads (and other nonsense too)</h2>
<p>Red Hat makes money by selling a stable OS with at least 10 years of support to enterprises, and their free offering is Fedora, with just 13 months of support; RHEL releases are branched off from Fedora. SUSE also sells SUSE Linux Enterprise and has openSUSE as the free offering (but the relationship between the paid and free version is more complicated).</p>
<p>Ubuntu chose a different monetization strategy: the enterprise offering is the same OS as the free offering, but it gets extra packages and extra updates. The free OS advertises the paid services. It is fairly simple to get rid of them all:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">sudo apt autoremove ubuntu-pro-client
sudo chmod -x /etc/update-motd.d/*
</pre></div>

<p>Also, Ubuntu installs snap by default. Snap is a terrible idea. Luckily, there are no snaps installed by default on a Server install, so we can just remove <code>snapd</code>. We’ll also remove <code>lxd-installer</code> to save ~25 kB of disk space, since the installer requires snap, and lxd is another unsuccessful Canonical project.</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">sudo apt autoremove snapd lxd-installer
</pre></div>

<h2>The cost of downgrading</h2>
<p>Going from Fedora 42 (April 2025) to Ubuntu 24.04 (April 2024) means some software will be downgraded in the process. In general, this does not matter, as most software does not mind downgrades as much. One notable exception is WeeChat, the IRC client, whose config files are versioned, and Ubuntu’s version is not compatible with the one in Fedora. But here’s where Ubuntu’s popularity shines: <a href="https://weechat.org/download/debian/">WeeChat has its own repositories for Debian and Ubuntu</a>, so I could just get the latest version without building it myself or trying to steal packages from a newer version.</p>
<p>Other than WeeChat, I haven’t experienced any other issues with software due to a downgrade. Some of it is luck (or not using new/advanced features), some of it is software caring about backwards compatibility.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Was it worth it? Time will tell. Upgrading Fedora itself was not that hard, and I expect Ubuntu upgrades to be OK too — the annoying part was cleaning up and getting things to work after the upgrade, and the switch means I will have to do it only every 2-4 years instead of every 6-12 months.</p>
<p>The switchover took a few hours, especially since I didn’t have much up-to-date documentation of what is actually installed and running, and there are always the minor details where distros differ that may require adjusting to. I think a migration like this is worth trying if rolling-release or frequently-released distros are too unstable for your needs.</p>

            <p>Last week, we had a great time at <a href="https://www.pycon.fr/2025/">PyCon FR 2025</a> - a free (!) gathering for Pythonistas in France. Here are some of our highlights.</p>
<h3 id="s-sprints-on-django-our-website-ia-marketing">Sprints on Django, our website, IA, marketing</h3>
<p>Over two days, the conference started with <strong>27 contributors</strong> joining us to contribute to <strong>Django</strong> and our website and online presence. Half in the room were complete newcomers to open source, wanting to get a taste of what it’s like behind the scenes. We also had people who were new to Django, taking the excellent <a href="https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/">Django Girls tutorial</a> to get up to speed with the project. The tutorial is translated in 20 languages(!), so it’s excellent in situations like this where people come from all over Europe.</p>

<h3 id="s-discussing-djangos-direction">Discussing Django’s direction</h3>
<p>At the sprints, we also organized discussions on Django’s direction - specifically on marketing, Artificial Intelligence, and technical decisions. Some recurring topics were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Highlights from the <a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/pycharm/2025/10/the-state-of-django-2025/">State of Django 2025</a> report produced by JetBrains, and the need for fundraising partnerships like their ongoing <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/promo/support-django/">30% Off PyCharm Pro – 100% for Django</a> campaign.</li>
<li>What “batteries included” means for Django in 2025. Does it include REST? Contributors discussed the recent forum thread <a href="https://forum.djangoproject.com/t/django-needs-a-rest-story/42814">Django needs a REST story</a>.</li>
<li>Type hints and Django. The <a href="https://github.com/django/new-features/issues/23">existing feature requests</a>, and how feature requests are meant to work for Django.</li>
<li>The impact of Artificial Intelligence on Django and Django developers. How AI adoption could be supported with documentation investments, but also the ethical concerns of AI coding.</li>
</ul>
<p>We had a great time during those two days of sprints ❤️ thank you to everyone involved, we hope you stick around!</p>
<h3 id="s-design-systems-with-jinjax-stimulus-and-cube-css">Design systems with JinjaX, Stimulus, and Cube CSS</h3>
<p><a href="https://m4dz.net/">Mads</a> demonstrated how to bring a design-system mindset to Django projects by combining <a href="https://github.com/jpsca/jinjax">JinjaX</a>, <a href="https://stimulus.hotwired.dev/">Stimulus JS</a>, and <a href="https://cube.fyi/">Cube CSS</a>. Supported by modern tooling like <strong>Figma</strong>, <strong>Vite</strong>, and <strong>Storybook</strong>. JinjaX in particular, allows to take a more component-driven “lego blocks” approach to front-end development with Django.</p>

<h3 id="s-three-years-of-htmx-in-django">Three years of htmx in Django</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/celinemartinet1/">Céline Martinet Sanchez</a> shared her takeaways from using htmx with Django over three years. The verdict? A joyful developer experience, some (solved) challenges with testing.</p>
<p>Her recommended additions to make the most of the two frameworks:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/adamchainz/django-htmx">django-htmx</a>: opinionated htmx integration</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mixxorz/slippers">Slippers</a>: better DX for Django templates</li>

<h3 id="s-becoming-an-open-source-contributor-in-2025">Becoming an open-source contributor in 2025</h3>
<p>In her talk, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amandasavluchinske/">Amanda Savluchinske</a> explored how newcomers can get involved in open source—highlighting the Django community’s <a href="https://djangonaut.space/">Djangonaut Space</a> program. She explains why doing it is great, how to engage with busy maintainers, and specific actions people can take to get started.</p>
<p>We really liked her sharing a prompt she uses with AI, to iterate on questions to maintainers before hitting “send”:</p>
<p>“You are an expert in technical writing. I'm trying to write a message about a question I have about this open-source project I'm contributing to. Here's the link to its repo ‹Add link here›. I want to convey my question to the maintainers in a clear, concise way, at the same time that I want it to have enough context so that the communication happens with the least back and forth possible. I want this question to contain a short, max two sentence summary upfront, and then more context in the text's body. Ask me whatever questions you need about my question and context in order to produce this message.”</p>
<p><img alt="Amanda showcases contributor programs Google Summer of Code and Djangonaut Space" src="https://media.djangoproject.com/blog/images/2025/11/PyConFR2025_20251102_Amanda_showcases_contributor_programs_Google_Su_oSIShcj.JPG" /></p>
<h3 id="s-la-suite-numerique-government-collaboration-powered-by-django">La Suite numérique: government collaboration powered by Django</h3>
<p>PyCon FR also featured <a href="https://lasuite.numerique.gouv.fr/en">La Suite numérique</a>, the French government’s collaborative workspace—developed with partners in Germany, the Netherlands (<a href="https://minbzk.github.io/mijn-bureau/">Mijn Bureau</a>), and Italy. Their platform includes collaborative documents, video calls, chat, and an AI assistant — all powered by Django 🤘. This work is now part of a wider European Union initiative for sovereign digital infrastructure based on open source, for more information see: <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/commission-launch-digital-commons-edic-support-sovereign-european-digital-infrastructure-and">Commission to launch Digital Commons EDIC to support sovereign European digital infrastructure and technology</a>.</p>

<blockquote class="story-author-note anim-fade-in">

<h2 class="story-heading anim-slide-up" id="1-fluent-python-clear-concise-and-effective-programming">1. Fluent Python: Clear, Concise, and Effective Programming</h2>

<p><strong>العنوان العربي:</strong> “بايثون بطلاقة: برمجة واضحة، موجزة، وفعالة”
<strong>المؤلف:</strong> لوتشيانو راماليو (Luciano Ramalho)</p>

<p>هذا ليس كتابًا للمبتدئين، بل هو “الكتاب المقدس” لفهم روح بايثون. لا يعلمك الكتاب بناء الجملة، بل يعلمك <strong>التفكير</strong> بلغة بايثون. إنه يكشف القوة الكامنة وراء ميزات اللغة التي غالبًا ما يتم تجاهلها.</p>

<p><strong>أهم الميزات:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>الغوص العميق:</strong> يشرح هياكل البيانات الأساسية في بايثون وكيفية عملها داخليًا، مما يجعلك تستخدمها بكفاءة لا مثيل لها.</li>
  <li><strong>النموذج البياني لبايثون (Python Data Model):</strong> يكشف سر “سحر” بايثون من خلال شرح الـ <code class="highlighter-rouge">magic methods</code> (مثل <code class="highlighter-rouge">__getitem__</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">__len__</code>) وكيف تمكنك من جعل كائناتك تتصرف مثل الأنواع المدمجة.</li>
  <li><strong>البرمجة المتزامنة:</strong> يقدم شرحًا من أفضل ما كُتب عن المولدات (generators)، الكوروتين (coroutines)، و <code class="highlighter-rouge">asyncio</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>السر الذي يكشفه:</strong> كبار المطورين لا يحفظون الدوال، بل يفهمون <strong>البروتوكولات</strong> التي تعمل بها اللغة. هذا الكتاب يعلمك تلك البروتوكولات، مما يمنحك القدرة على كتابة كود “بايثوني” أصيل وفعال.</p>

<p class="story-content page-4 page-type-list anim-fade-in"><strong>كيف تحصل عليه مجانًا:</strong> الكتاب ليس مجانيًا، ولكن يمكنك الوصول إليه عبر اشتراك في منصة O’Reilly التعليمية (التي تقدم غالبًا فترة تجريبية مجانية).</p>

<blockquote class="story-author-note anim-fade-in">
  <p>رأيي الشخصي: إذا كان عليك شراء كتاب واحد فقط لتطوير مستواك في بايثون، فليكن هذا الكتاب. كل صفحة فيه تحتوي على معلومة ثمينة ستغير نظرتك للغة.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />
<h2 class="story-heading anim-slide-up" id="2-python-cookbook-3rd-edition">2. Python Cookbook, 3rd Edition</h2>

<p><strong>العنوان العربي:</strong> “كتاب طبخ بايثون، الإصدار الثالث”
<strong>المؤلفون:</strong> ديفيد بيزلي (David Beazley) و براين ك. جونز (Brian K. Jones)</p>

<p>تخيل أنك تواجه مشكلة برمجية شائعة، وبدلاً من البحث في Stack Overflow عن حلول متضاربة، تفتح كتابًا يقدم لك وصفة (recipe) أنيقة، فعالة، و”بايثونية” لحل المشكلة، مع شرح تفصيلي لسبب نجاح هذا الحل. هذا هو بالضبط ما يقدمه هذا الكتاب.</p>

<p><strong>أهم الميزات:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>موجه نحو الحلول:</strong> يركز الكتاب على مشاكل عملية واقعية، من معالجة البيانات إلى البرمجة المتزامنة.</li>
  <li><strong>كود حديث:</strong> جميع الوصفات مكتوبة لبايثون 3 وتستغل أحدث ميزات اللغة.</li>
  <li><strong>شروحات عميقة:</strong> كل وصفة لا تقدم الحل فقط، بل تشرح الآليات الكامنة وراءه، مما يعمق فهمك للغة.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>السر الذي يكشفه:</strong> المطورون الخبراء لديهم “صندوق أدوات” عقلي من الأنماط والحلول الجاهزة. هذا الكتاب يملأ صندوق أدواتك بوصفات مجربة ومختبرة، مما يوفر عليك ساعات من التجربة والخطأ ويضمن أن حلك للمشكلات ليس فقط صحيحًا، بل وأنيقًا أيضًا.</p>

<p class="story-content page-5 page-type-list anim-fade-in"><strong>كيف تحصل عليه:</strong> مثل الكتاب السابق، أفضل طريقة للوصول إليه هي عبر منصة O’Reilly.</p>

<hr />
<h2 class="story-heading anim-slide-up" id="3-architecture-patterns-with-python">3. Architecture Patterns with Python</h2>

<p><strong>العنوان العربي:</strong> “أنماط الهيكلة مع بايثون”
<strong>المؤلفون:</strong> هاري بيرسيفال (Harry Percival) و بوب غريغوري (Bob Gregory)</p>

<p>هذا الكتاب ينقلك من مستوى كتابة الأكواد والاسكربتات إلى مستوى <strong>بناء الأنظمة</strong>. يركز على كيفية تطبيق أنماط تصميم عالية المستوى مثل (Domain-Driven Design (DDD و Clean Architecture في سياق بايثون.</p>

<p><strong>أهم الميزات:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>التطبيق العملي:</strong> يأخذك في رحلة بناء تطبيق حقيقي من الصفر، مطبقًا الأنماط خطوة بخطوة.</li>
  <li><strong>فصل الاهتمامات (Separation of Concerns):</strong> يعلمك كيف تفصل منطق العمل الأساسي (domain logic) عن تفاصيل البنية التحتية (قواعد البيانات، واجهات برمجة التطبيقات)، مما يجعل الكود قابلاً للاختبار والصيانة.</li>
  <li><strong>الاختبار أولاً (TDD):</strong> يستخدم نهج التطوير الموجه بالاختبار (Test-Driven Development) كأساس لبناء النظام.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>السر الذي يكشفه:</strong> الكود الذي يعمل اليوم قد يصبح كابوس الصيانة غدًا. كبار المطورين لا يفكرون فقط في ميزة اليوم، بل في كيفية تطور النظام على مدى سنوات. هذا الكتاب يعلمك التفكير كمهندس معماري للبرمجيات، وليس مجرد بنّاء.</p>

<p class="story-content page-6 page-type-list anim-fade-in"><strong>كيف تحصل عليه مجانًا:</strong> هذا الكتاب <strong>متاح بالكامل ومجانًا</strong> على الإنترنت على الموقع الرسمي <code class="highlighter-rouge">cosmicpython.com</code>. إنها فرصة لا تقدر بثمن.</p>

<blockquote class="story-sticker anim-fade-in">
  <p>هذا الكتاب هو الجسر المفقود بين معرفة بايثون وبناء تطبيقات مؤسسية قوية.</p>

<p><strong>العنوان العربي:</strong> “الكود النظيف في بايثون”
<strong>المؤلف:</strong> ماريانو أنايا (Mariano Anaya)</p>

<p>يأخذ هذا الكتاب المبادئ الخالدة من كتاب “Clean Code” الشهير لـ Robert C. Martin ويطبقها خصيصًا على عالم بايثون. إنه دليل عملي لكتابة كود ليس فقط فعالًا، بل أيضًا مقروءًا وقابلاً للصيانة والتوسيع.</p>

<p><strong>أهم الميزات:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>تكييف المبادئ لبايثون:</strong> يشرح كيف تبدو مبادئ مثل SOLID، DRY، KISS في سياق بايثون، مع الأخذ في الاعتبار طبيعة اللغة الديناميكية.</li>
  <li><strong>أمثلة “بايثونية”:</strong> مليء بأمثلة “قبل وبعد” التي توضح كيف تحول الكود من فوضوي إلى نظيف باستخدام ميزات بايثون.</li>
  <li><strong>تغطية شاملة:</strong> يغطي كل شيء من تسمية المتغيرات والدوال إلى التعامل مع الأخطاء وتصميم الكائنات.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>السر الذي يكشفه:</strong> “الكود الذي يعمل” هو الحد الأدنى المتوقع. القيمة الحقيقية للمطور تكمن في كتابة كود يمكن لفريق كامل أن يفهمه ويعمل عليه بكفاءة. هذا الكتاب يعلمك كيف تكتب كودًا يراعي “القارئ” المستقبلي (الذي قد يكون أنت بعد ستة أشهر).</p>

<h2 class="story-heading anim-slide-up" id="5-effective-python-90-specific-ways-to-write-better-python">5. Effective Python: 90 Specific Ways to Write Better Python</h2>

<p><strong>العنوان العربي:</strong> “بايثون الفعالة: 90 طريقة محددة لكتابة بايثون أفضل”
<strong>المؤلف:</strong> بريت سلاتكين (Brett Slatkin)</p>

<p>إذا كان “Fluent Python” هو الرواية العميقة، فإن “Effective Python” هو مجموعة من الحكم القصيرة والمكثفة. كل “طريقة” في الكتاب هي نصيحة محددة وقابلة للتنفيذ يمكنك تطبيقها فورًا لتحسين الكود الخاص بك.</p>

<p><strong>أهم الميزات:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>نصائح مركزة:</strong> كل فصل قصير، ويعالج نقطة واحدة محددة، مما يجعله سهل الهضم والتطبيق.</li>
  <li><strong>تغطية واسعة:</strong> يغطي مجموعة واسعة من المواضيع، من التعبيرات البايثونية (Pythonic expressions) إلى التزامن (concurrency) والمتانة (robustness).</li>
  <li><strong>أمثلة واضحة:</strong> كل نصيحة مدعومة بأمثلة توضح “الطريقة السيئة” و”الطريقة الأفضل”.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>السر الذي يكشفه:</strong> الاحتراف هو نتيجة تراكم العادات الجيدة الصغيرة. هذا الكتاب يزودك بـ 90 عادة صغيرة ومحددة، والتي بتطبيقها المستمر، ستحول جودة الكود الذي تكتبه بشكل جذري. إنه يعلمك أن التميز يكمن في التفاصيل.</p>

<p class="story-content page-8 page-type-list anim-fade-in"><strong>كيف تحصل عليه:</strong> الكتاب جزء من سلسلة “Effective Software Development” الشهيرة، ومتوفر للشراء أو عبر اشتراك O’Reilly.</p>

<h2 class="story-heading anim-slide-up" id="6-python-tricks-a-buffet-of-awesome-python-features">6. Python Tricks: A Buffet of Awesome Python Features</h2>

<p><strong>العنوان العربي:</strong> “خدع بايثون: بوفيه من ميزات بايثون الرائعة”
<strong>المؤلف:</strong> دان بادر (Dan Bader)</p>

<p>هذا الكتاب هو احتفال بجمال وقوة بايثون. يركز دان بادر، مؤسس موقع Real Python الشهير، على الميزات والأنماط التي تجعل الكود أكثر تعبيرًا و”بايثونية”. إنه أقل أكاديمية وأكثر متعة، لكنه لا يقل أهمية.</p>

<p><strong>أهم الميزات:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>اكتشافات ممتعة:</strong> يكشف عن طرق أنيقة لاستخدام ميزات قد تعرفها بالفعل، بالإضافة إلى جواهر خفية في اللغة.</li>
  <li><strong>تركيز على الوضوح:</strong> الهدف من كل “خدعة” هو جعل الكود ليس فقط أقصر، بل أكثر وضوحًا في القصد.</li>
  <li><strong>أمثلة عملية:</strong> كل خدعة تأتي مع مثال عملي يوضح كيف ومتى تستخدمها.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>السر الذي يكشفه:</strong> أفضل المطورين يستمتعون بعملهم. هذا الكتاب يعيد إشعال شغفك باللغة من خلال إظهار الطرق المبتكرة والأنيقة التي يمكنك من خلالها التعبير عن أفكارك. إنه يعلمك أن الكود الفعال يمكن أن يكون جميلاً أيضًا.</p>

<p class="story-content page-9 page-type-list anim-fade-in"><strong>كيف تحصل عليه:</strong> متوفر للشراء مباشرة من المؤلف، وغالبًا ما يأتي مع محتوى إضافي مثل مقاطع الفيديو.</p>

<h2 class="story-heading anim-slide-up" id="7-the-pythonic-way-write-more-idiomatic-python">7. The Pythonic Way: Write More Idiomatic Python</h2>

<p><strong>العنوان العربي:</strong> “الطريقة البايثونية: اكتب كود بايثون أكثر اصطلاحية”
<strong>المؤلف:</strong> إيان لي (Ian Lee)</p>

<p>كما يوحي الاسم، هذا الكتاب مكرس بالكامل لمفهوم الكود “البايثوني”. إنه يأخذ الأنماط الشائعة من لغات أخرى (مثل C++ أو Java) ويوضح لك كيف يمكن تحقيق نفس الهدف بطريقة أكثر طبيعية وأناقة في بايثون.</p>

<p><strong>أهم الميزات:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>مقارنات مباشرة:</strong> يقارن بشكل مباشر بين الأنماط “غير البايثونية” والبدائل “البايثونية”، مما يجعل الفروق واضحة جدًا.</li>
  <li><strong>فلسفة اللغة:</strong> يتعمق في “لماذا” تفضل بايثون أسلوبًا على آخر، ويربط ذلك بفلسفة “The Zen of Python”.</li>
  <li><strong>موجز وعملي:</strong> الكتاب ليس ضخمًا، ولكنه مليء بالنصائح العملية التي يمكنك البدء في استخدامها على الفور.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>السر الذي يكشفه:</strong> أن تكون مطور بايثون لا يعني فقط كتابة كود يعمل في مفسر بايثون. بل يعني تبني فلسفة اللغة وأسلوبها. هذا الكتاب هو دليلك لترجمة أفكارك البرمجية إلى “لهجة” بايثون الأصلية، بدلاً من التحدث بلكنة لغة أخرى.</p>

<p class="story-content page-10 page-type-list anim-fade-in"><strong>كيف تحصل عليه:</strong> الكتاب متاح للشراء ككتاب إلكتروني، مما يجعله سهل الوصول.</p>

<p class="story-content page-2 page-type-text anim-fade-in">المعسكرات التدريبية تعلمك بناء الجملة، لكنها لا تعلمك <strong>الفلسفة</strong>. تعلمك كيفية استخدام أداة، لكن ليس كيفية بناء نظام متكامل. واجهة برمجة التطبيقات ليست مجرد مجموعة من الدوال التي يمكن استدعاؤها عبر الشبكة؛ إنها واجهة منتجك الرقمي. إذا كانت سيئة التصميم، فمنتجك بأكمله سيء، بغض النظر عن مدى روعة الكود خلفها.</p>

<h2 class="story-subheading anim-type-out" id="1-بايثون-السلس-fluent-python">1. “بايثون السلس” (Fluent Python)</h2>

<p><strong>المؤلف:</strong> لوتشيانو راماليو (Luciano Ramalho)</p>

<p><strong>لماذا هو سر؟</strong>
يعتقد الكثيرون أنهم يعرفون بايثون، لكنهم في الحقيقة يعرفون “جافا المكتوبة ببايثون” أو “جافاسكريبت المكتوبة ببايثون”. هذا الكتاب هو الترياق. إنه لا يعلمك فقط <strong>ماذا</strong> تفعله ميزات بايثون، بل <strong>لماذا</strong> توجد وكيف تستخدمها بفعالية لإنشاء كود “بايثوني” حقيقي: واضح، موجز، وفعال.</p>

<p><strong>ماذا ستتعلم لبناء APIs أفضل؟</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>نماذج البيانات (Data Models):</strong> كيف تجعل كائناتك تتصرف مثل الأنواع المضمنة في بايثون، مما يجعل واجهاتك البرمجية الداخلية بديهية.</li>
  <li><strong>الدوال ككائنات من الدرجة الأولى:</strong> فهم عميق للمُزخرفات (Decorators) والإغلاقات (Closures)، وهي أدوات لا غنى عنها في أطر عمل الويب الحديثة مثل Flask و FastAPI.</li>
  <li><strong>البرمجة المتزامنة (Concurrency):</strong> يغوص الكتاب في <code class="highlighter-rouge">asyncio</code>، مما يمنحك فهماً أساسياً لبناء APIs عالية الأداء يمكنها التعامل مع آلاف الطلبات في وقت واحد.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote class="story-author-note anim-fade-in">

<p><strong>المؤلفون:</strong> هاري بيرسيفال (Harry Percival) وبوب غريغوري (Bob Gregory)</p>

<p><strong>لماذا هو سر؟</strong>
هذا الكتاب يأخذك بعيداً عن عالم “البرامج النصية” و “التطبيقات البسيطة” إلى عالم <strong>هندسة البرمجيات الحقيقية</strong>. السر الذي لا يخبرك به أحد هو أن أفضل الواجهات البرمجية ليست مجرد طبقة فوق قاعدة البيانات؛ إنها انعكاس لنطاق العمل (Business Domain). هذا الكتاب يعلمك كيفية تحقيق ذلك باستخدام <strong>التصميم الموجه بالمجال (Domain-Driven Design - DDD)</strong> و<strong>الهندسة النظيفة (Clean Architecture)</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>ماذا ستتعلم لبناء APIs أفضل؟</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>فصل الاهتمامات:</strong> كيف تفصل منطق عملك الأساسي عن تفاصيل إطار العمل (مثل Flask) وقاعدة البيانات. هذا يعني أنه يمكنك تغيير قاعدة بياناتك أو حتى إطار عمل الويب دون إعادة كتابة قلب تطبيقك.</li>
  <li><strong>نمط المستودع (Repository Pattern):</strong> طريقة مجربة لعزل طبقة البيانات، مما يجعل اختبار منطق عملك سهلاً للغاية.</li>
  <li><strong>الخدمات المصغرة (Microservices):</strong> يقدم الكتاب مقدمة عملية لكيفية تقسيم تطبيق متجانس (Monolith) إلى خدمات أصغر وأكثر قابلية للإدارة، وهو أمر حاسم للأنظمة الكبيرة.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote class="story-author-note anim-fade-in">
  <p>رأيي الشخصي: هذا الكتاب هو أهم كتاب قرأته في السنوات الخمس الماضية. لقد غير تماماً طريقتي في بناء التطبيقات. قبل هذا الكتاب، كنت أبني تطبيقات ويب. بعده، أصبحت أبني أنظمة برمجية.</p>

<p><strong>المؤلف:</strong> سام نيومان (Sam Newman)</p>

<p><strong>لماذا هو سر؟</strong>
عندما تبدأ في بناء أكثر من API واحد، فإنك تدخل عالم الأنظمة الموزعة، سواء أدركت ذلك أم لا. هذا العالم له قواعده الخاصة وتحدياته الخفية. يتجاهل معظم المطورين هذه التعقيدات حتى تنهار أنظمتهم. هذا الكتاب هو الدليل الشامل لفلسفة الخدمات المصغرة، وهو أمر ضروري لأي شخص يصمم APIs تتفاعل مع بعضها البعض.</p>

<p><strong>ماذا ستتعلم لبناء APIs أفضل؟</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>حجم الخدمة المناسب:</strong> متى وكيف تقسم نظامك إلى خدمات؟ (تلميح: ليس دائماً أصغر هو الأفضل).</li>
  <li><strong>استراتيجيات التكامل:</strong> كيف تتواصل الخدمات مع بعضها البعض بشكل موثوق؟ (REST, gRPC, Message Queues). هذا هو جوهر تصميم الـ API في بيئة الخدمات المصغرة.</li>
  <li><strong>المراقبة والتحمل:</strong> كيف تصمم واجهات برمجية يمكنها التعامل مع فشل الخدمات الأخرى بأمان (باستخدام أنماط مثل Circuit Breaker).</li>
  <li><strong>الأمان:</strong> استراتيجيات تأمين الاتصالات بين الخدمات.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote class="story-author-note anim-fade-in">
  <p>رأيي الشخصي: بناء API واحدة شيء، وبناء نظام من واجهات APIs المتعددة شيء آخر تماماً. هذا الكتاب يمنحك العقلية اللازمة للنجاح في السيناريو الثاني، وهو ما يميز المهندسين الكبار.</p>

<p><strong>المؤلف:</strong> جي جي جيواكس (JJ Geewax)</p>

<p><strong>لماذا هو سر؟</strong>
تماماً كما توجد أنماط تصميم للكائنات (Object-Oriented Design Patterns)، توجد أنماط مثبتة لبناء واجهات برمجية قوية ومرنة. معظم المطورين يرتجلون، ويعيدون اختراع العجلة (غالباً بشكل سيء). هذا الكتاب يجمع عقوداً من الخبرة في تصميم الـ API في Google ويقدمها لك في شكل كتالوج من الأنماط العملية.</p>

<p><strong>ماذا ستتعلم لبناء APIs أفضل؟</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>أنماط تصميم الموارد:</strong> كيف تسمي وتنظم مواردك بطريقة بديهية (مثل <code class="highlighter-rouge">Singleton Resource</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Listable Singleton</code>).</li>
  <li><strong>أنماط تصميم الطلبات والاستجابات:</strong> تقنيات للتعامل مع العمليات طويلة الأمد (Long-Running Operations)، وترقيم الصفحات (Pagination)، والطلبات الجزئية (Partial Responses) بكفاءة.</li>
  <li><strong>أنماط التطور (Evolution Patterns):</strong> كيف تحدث واجهتك البرمجية وتضيف ميزات جديدة دون كسر تطبيقات العملاء الحاليين. هذا هو الكأس المقدس لتصميم الـ API.</li>
  <li><strong>معالجة الأخطاء المتقدمة:</strong> تصميم رسائل خطأ مفيدة وقابلة للتنفيذ آلياً.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote class="story-author-note anim-fade-in">
  <p>رأيي الشخصي: هذا الكتاب هو المكافئ لـ ‘كتاب الأنماط’ الكلاسيكي (Gang of Four) ولكن لعالم الـ API. إنه ليس للقراءة من الغلاف إلى الغلاف، بل هو مرجع تعود إليه في كل مرة تواجه فيها مشكلة تصميم جديدة.</p>

<p><strong>ماذا ستتعلم لبناء APIs أفضل؟</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>التصميم من أجل الصيانة:</strong> تقنيات لجعل الكود الخاص بك، بما في ذلك منطق الـ API، أكثر مرونة للتغييرات المستقبلية.</li>
  <li><strong>فصل الكود:</strong> استراتيجيات عملية لتفكيك الكود إلى مكونات مستقلة وقابلة لإعادة الاستخدام، مما يجعل واجهاتك البرمجية أنظف.</li>
  <li><strong>قوة التجريد:</strong> متى ولماذا تنشئ طبقات تجريد في الكود الخاص بك لحماية واجهتك البرمجية من التغييرات في التفاصيل الداخلية.</li>
  <li><strong>الكتابة من أجل الآخرين:</strong> يركز الكتاب على أن الكود يُقرأ أكثر مما يُكتب، وهي فلسفة أساسية لتصميم واجهات برمجية ناجحة يفهمها ويستخدمها الآخرون بسهولة.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote class="story-author-note anim-fade-in">
  <p>رأيي الشخصي: إذا كان ‘Fluent Python’ يعلمك كيف تتحدث بايثون بطلاقة، فإن هذا الكتاب يعلمك كيف تكتب بها مقالات ورسائل واضحة ومقنعة. إنه يتعلق بالجانب الإنساني من البرمجة، وهو ما يتم تجاهله غالباً.</p>

<p class="story-content page-2 page-type-text anim-fade-in">الحقيقة هي أن <strong>بطء بايثون هو خيار وليس قدراً</strong>. كبار المطورين لا يضيعون وقتهم في الشكوى من مترجم بايثون (Interpreter). بدلاً من ذلك، يسألون: “أين عنق الزجاجة؟” ثم يستخدمون الأدوات المناسبة لسحقه.</p>

<p class="story-sticker anim-fade-in">هذه الأدوات والتقنيات هي سر محفوظ جيداً. إنها الجسر الذي يربط بين سهولة بايثون وقوة لغات مثل C و Rust. في هذه القصة، سنكشف عن الكتب التي تحتوي على هذه الأسرار.</p>

<h2 class="story-heading anim-slide-up" id="1-high-performance-python">1. High Performance Python</h2>

<p><strong>العنوان الأصلي:</strong> <em>High Performance Python: Practical Performant Programming for Humans</em>
<strong>العنوان المترجم:</strong> <em>بايثون عالية الأداء: برمجة عملية عالية الأداء للبشر</em>
<strong>المؤلفون:</strong> Micha Gorelick (ميشا غورليك) &amp; Ian Ozsvald (إيان أوزفالد)</p>

<p>هذا الكتاب هو نقطة البداية المثالية وأشبه ما يكون بالكتاب المقدس في هذا المجال. إنه لا يخبرك فقط <em>ماذا</em> تفعل، بل <em>لماذا</em> و<em>متى</em>. يغطي الكتاب كل شيء بدءاً من أساسيات التنميط (profiling) لتحديد الأجزاء البطيئة في الكود، وصولاً إلى تقنيات متقدمة مثل الحوسبة المتوازية واستخدام NumPy بفعالية.</p>

<p><strong>أهم الميزات:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>نهج عملي:</strong> يركز الكتاب على مشاكل واقعية ويقدم حلولاً عملية يمكنك تطبيقها مباشرة.</li>
  <li><strong>تغطية شاملة:</strong> من التنميط إلى تعدد المعالجة (multiprocessing) و Cython.</li>
  <li><strong>أمثلة واضحة:</strong> كل مفهوم مدعوم بأمثلة كود توضح الفرق في الأداء قبل وبعد التحسين.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>السر الذي يكشفه:</strong>
كبار المطورين لا يحسنون كل شيء. إنهم يتبعون قاعدة 80/20: 80% من البطء يأتي من 20% من الكود. يعلمك هذا الكتاب كيف تجد تلك الـ 20% وتجعلها سريعة بشكل مذهل. هذا هو الفرق بين إضاعة أسابيع في تحسينات لا طائل منها، وتحقيق قفزة في الأداء في غضون ساعات.</p>

<p class="story-content page-4 page-type-text anim-fade-in"><strong>كيف تحصل عليه:</strong>

<h2 class="story-heading anim-slide-up" id="2-cython-a-guide-for-python-programmers">2. Cython: A Guide for Python Programmers</h2>

<p><strong>العنوان الأصلي:</strong> <em>Cython: A Guide for Python Programmers</em>
<strong>العنوان المترجم:</strong> <em>سايثون: دليل لمبرمجي بايثون</em>
<strong>المؤلف:</strong> Kurt W. Smith (كيرت دبليو. سميث)</p>

<p>إذا كان الكتاب السابق هو الخريطة، فإن Cython هي الصاروخ الذي ستستخدمه. Cython هي لغة هجينة تتيح لك كتابة كود يشبه بايثون ولكنه يُترجم مباشرة إلى C. النتيجة؟ سرعات يمكن أن تكون <strong>أسرع بمئات المرات</strong> من بايثون النقية.</p>

<p><strong>أهم الميزات:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>شرح متعمق:</strong> الكتاب هو أفضل مرجع شامل لـ Cython، كتبه أحد المساهمين الأساسيين في المشروع.</li>
  <li><strong>التكامل مع C:</strong> يعلمك كيفية استدعاء مكتبات C الموجودة مباشرة من كود Cython الخاص بك.</li>
  <li><strong>إدارة الذاكرة:</strong> يشرح كيفية التعامل مع الذاكرة يدوياً عند الحاجة لتحقيق أقصى أداء.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>السر الذي يكشفه:</strong>
يعرف كبار المطورين أن مترجم بايثون (CPython) نفسه مكتوب بلغة C. Cython تمنحك جسراً مباشراً إلى هذا العالم. السر هنا هو أنك لست مضطراً لإعادة كتابة كل شيء. يمكنك أخذ دالة واحدة بطيئة في مشروعك، تحويلها إلى Cython، وترك بقية الكود كما هو. هذه القدرة على “الجراحة الدقيقة” للأداء هي مهارة لا تقدر بثمن.</p>

<p class="story-content page-5 page-type-text anim-fade-in"><strong>كيف تحصل عليه:</strong>
الكتاب متاح للشراء. للحصول على معرفة مجانية، فإن <strong>توثيق Cython الرسمي</strong> ممتاز ويعتبر بديلاً رائعاً ومفتوح المصدر. ابدأ بصفحة “Cython for NumPy users” إذا كنت تعمل في مجال البيانات.</p>

<h2 class="story-heading anim-slide-up" id="3-fluent-python">3. Fluent Python</h2>

<p><strong>العنوان الأصلي:</strong> <em>Fluent Python: Clear, Concise, and Effective Programming</em>
<strong>العنوان المترجم:</strong> <em>بايثون بطلاقة: برمجة واضحة، موجزة، وفعالة</em>
<strong>المؤلف:</strong> Luciano Ramalho (لوتشيانو راماليو)</p>

<p>قد يبدو هذا الكتاب غريباً في قائمة عن الأداء، لكنه ربما يكون الأهم. لماذا؟ لأنه قبل أن تتمكن من جعل الكود سريعاً، يجب أن تفهم <strong>الطريقة الصحيحة</strong> لكتابته. “Fluent Python” لا يعلمك بناء الجملة (syntax)، بل يعلمك <strong>روح</strong> اللغة.</p>

<p><strong>أهم الميزات:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>التركيز على “Pythonic”:</strong> يشرح كيفية استخدام ميزات اللغة الفريدة مثل المولدات (generators)، والديكوريتورز (decorators)، والأساليب السحرية (magic methods).</li>
  <li><strong>هياكل البيانات العميقة:</strong> يغوص في كيفية عمل القواميس، القوائم، والمجموعات من الداخل.</li>
  <li><strong>البرمجة المتزامنة:</strong> يقدم شرحاً رائعاً لـ asyncio، وهو أمر بالغ الأهمية للأداء في المهام المرتبطة بالشبكات.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>السر الذي يكشفه:</strong>
في كثير من الأحيان، الكود البطيء هو ببساطة كود “غير بايثوني”. قد يكتب خريج bootcamp حلقة <code class="highlighter-rouge">for</code> لمعالجة قائمة، بينما يستخدم المطور الخبير “list comprehension” أو مولداً (generator) يقوم بنفس المهمة بشكل أسرع بكثير وباستهلاك ذاكرة أقل. يعلمك هذا الكتاب التفكير “بأسلوب بايثون”، مما يؤدي غالباً إلى كود أكثر أداءً بشكل طبيعي، حتى قبل أن تبدأ في التفكير في التحسين.</p>

<p class="story-content page-6 page-type-text anim-fade-in"><strong>كيف تحصل عليه:</strong>
الكتاب متاح للشراء. النسخة الثانية أحدث وتغطي ميزات بايثون الجديدة. يمكنك متابعة المؤلف على وسائل التواصل الاجتماعي، حيث يشارك الكثير من الأفكار القيمة مجاناً.</p>

<h2 class="story-heading anim-slide-up" id="4-the-c-programming-language-kr">4. The C Programming Language (K&amp;R)</h2>

<p><strong>العنوان الأصلي:</strong> <em>The C Programming Language</em>
<strong>العنوان المترجم:</strong> <em>لغة البرمجة C</em>
<strong>المؤلفون:</strong> Brian W. Kernighan (براين كيرنيغان) &amp; Dennis M. Ritchie (دينيس ريتشي)</p>

<p>نعم، أنت تقرأ هذا بشكل صحيح. أحد أهم الكتب لتصبح خبيراً في أداء بايثون هو كتاب عن لغة C. لماذا؟ لأن CPython، المترجم الأكثر شيوعاً لبايثون، مكتوب بلغة C. لفهم حدود بايثون وكيفية تجاوزها، يجب أن تفهم اللغة التي بنيت عليها.</p>

<p><strong>أهم الميزات:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>الإيجاز والعمق:</strong> الكتاب أسطوري لإيجازه وقدرته على تعليم أساسيات C بقوة.</li>
  <li><strong>العودة إلى المصدر:</strong> يعلمك كيفية عمل المؤشرات (pointers) وإدارة الذاكرة، وهي المفاهيم التي تخفيها بايثون عنك.</li>
  <li><strong>أساس الواجهات:</strong> فهم C هو أساس كتابة وحدات C (C extensions) لبايثون، وهي الطريقة النهائية لتحقيق أقصى سرعة.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>السر الذي يكشفه:</strong>
كبار المطورين لا يخافون من “النزول إلى المعدن”. عندما تصل أداة مثل Cython إلى حدودها، فإنهم لا يترددون في كتابة وحدة C نقية. هذا الكتاب يزيل الغموض عن لغة C ويمنحك الثقة للتعامل معها. المعرفة بكيفية عمل الذاكرة على مستوى منخفض تمنحك منظوراً جديداً تماماً عند كتابة كود بايثون، حتى لو لم تكتب سطراً واحداً من C.</p>

<p class="story-content page-7 page-type-text anim-fade-in"><strong>كيف تحصل عليه:</strong>
الكتاب كلاسيكي ومتاح في كل مكان. يمكنك العثور على نسخ PDF منه بسهولة عبر الإنترنت، على الرغم من أن شراء نسخة ورقية يعتبر طقساً من طقوس المرور للعديد من المبرمجين.</p>

<blockquote class="story-author-note anim-fade-in">

<h2 class="story-heading anim-slide-up" id="5-the-rust-programming-language">5. The Rust Programming Language</h2>

<p><strong>العنوان الأصلي:</strong> <em>The Rust Programming Language</em>
<strong>العنوان المترجم:</strong> <em>لغة البرمجة Rust</em>
<strong>المؤلفون:</strong> Steve Klabnik (ستيف كلابنيك) &amp; Carol Nichols (كارول نيكولز)</p>

<p>هذا هو السر الأكثر حداثة في جعبة كبار مطوري بايثون. بينما كانت C هي الخيار التقليدي لتوسيع بايثون، ظهرت Rust كبديل أكثر أماناً وحداثة. Rust تمنحك سرعة C بدون الصداع المصاحب لإدارة الذاكرة والمؤشرات.</p>

<p><strong>أهم الميزات:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>الأمان أولاً:</strong> نظام الملكية (Ownership) في Rust يمنع فئات كاملة من الأخطاء المتعلقة بالذاكرة والتزامن.</li>
  <li><strong>تكامل ممتاز مع بايثون:</strong> مكتبات مثل PyO3 و Maturin تجعل بناء وحدات Rust لبايثون أمراً سلساً بشكل مدهش.</li>
  <li><strong>أداء لا يضاهى:</strong> Rust تنافس C و C++ مباشرة في الأداء.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>السر الذي يكشفه:</strong>
المستقبل هو الهجين. يدرك المطورون الكبار أن الجمع بين إنتاجية بايثون وأمان وأداء Rust هو مزيج قاتل. إنهم يبنون الأجزاء الحساسة للأداء أو التي تتطلب أماناً عالياً في تطبيقاتهم باستخدام Rust، ثم يعرضونها كوحدات بايثون عادية. هذه التقنية تمنحهم أفضل ما في العالمين، وهي ميزة تنافسية ضخمة.</p>

<p class="story-content page-8 page-type-text anim-fade-in"><strong>كيف تحصل عليه:</strong>
<strong>مجاني تماماً!</strong> الكتاب متاح للقراءة مجاناً على الموقع الرسمي لـ Rust. هذا يجعله أفضل مصدر ممكن للبدء. ابحث عن “The Rust Book” وستجده على الفور.</p>

<p><strong>العنوان العربي:</strong> المكتبة القياسية لبايثون بالأمثلة
<strong>المؤلف:</strong> دوغ هيلمان (Doug Hellmann)</p>

<p><strong>لماذا هو سر؟</strong>
يتجاهل 90% من المطورين الكنز المدفون في بايثون نفسها: المكتبة القياسية. يعتقدون أنها مجرد أدوات أساسية، فيلجؤون مباشرة إلى تثبيت مكتبات خارجية. هذا الكتاب يكشف لك أن المكتبة القياسية هي <strong>صندوق أدوات سحري</strong> مليء بوحدات قوية لحل مشاكل الشبكات، والتعامل مع البيانات، والتشفير، والخيوط المتعددة، وأكثر من ذلك بكثير، وكل ذلك <strong>بدون <code class="highlighter-rouge">pip install</code></strong>.</p>

<p><strong>أهم الميزات:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>شرح بالأمثلة:</strong> كل وحدة مشروحة بكود عملي يوضح حالات الاستخدام.</li>
  <li><strong>تغطية شاملة:</strong> يغطي أجزاء من المكتبة القياسية ربما لم تسمع بها من قبل.</li>
  <li><strong>زيادة الكفاءة:</strong> يعلمك متى تستخدم أداة مدمجة بدلاً من البحث عن حل خارجي، مما يقلل من الاعتماديات ويجعل برامجك أخف وأسرع.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>كيف يمنحك الأفضلية؟</strong>
كبار المطورين يقدرون الكود الذي يعتمد على أقل عدد ممكن من المكتبات الخارجية. إتقانك للمكتبة القياسية يجعلك تبدو خبيراً حقيقياً يعرف أدواته بعمق، وليس مجرد شخص يجمع المكتبات الشائعة.</p>

<h2 class="story-heading anim-slide-up" id="6-text-processing-in-python">6. Text Processing in Python</h2>

<p><strong>العنوان العربي:</strong> معالجة النصوص في بايثون
<strong>المؤلف:</strong> ديفيد ميرتز (David Mertz)</p>

<p><strong>لماذا هو سر؟</strong>
كل مطور يتعامل مع النصوص، لكن معظمهم يخدشون السطح باستخدام <code class="highlighter-rouge">split()</code> و <code class="highlighter-rouge">join()</code>. هذا الكتاب، على الرغم من أنه قديم بعض الشيء (مكتوب لبايثون 2)، إلا أن <strong>مبادئه خالدة</strong>. إنه غوص عميق في فن وعلم معالجة النصوص: من الترميز (Unicode) والتعبيرات النمطية (Regex) إلى تقنيات التحليل اللغوي (Parsing) المتقدمة.</p>

<p><strong>أهم الميزات:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>فهم عميق لـ Unicode:</strong> يحل واحدة من أكثر المشاكل إحباطاً للمطورين مرة واحدة وإلى الأبد.</li>
  <li><strong>إتقان التعبيرات النمطية:</strong> يأخذك إلى ما هو أبعد من المطابقة البسيطة.</li>
  <li><strong>تقنيات التحليل:</strong> يقدم نظرة على كيفية بناء محللات بسيطة للنصوص المهيكلة.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>كيف يمنحك الأفضلية؟</strong>
في عالم البيانات الضخمة والذكاء الاصطناعي، أصبحت معالجة النصوص مهارة مركزية. فهم كيفية التعامل مع النصوص بكفاءة ودقة يمنحك أفضلية هائلة في مجالات مثل تحليل البيانات، ومعالجة اللغات الطبيعية، وأتمتة المهام التي تتضمن بيانات نصية غير مهيكلة.</p>

<p class="story-content page-9 page-type-list anim-fade-in"><strong>أين تجده؟</strong>
الكتاب متاح للشراء. نظراً لقدمه، قد تجد نسخاً مستعملة بأسعار منخفضة. المبادئ الأساسية لا تزال ذات قيمة هائلة، ويمكن تكييف الكود بسهولة مع بايثون 3.</p>

<h2 class="story-heading anim-slide-up" id="7-twisted-network-programming-essentials">7. Twisted Network Programming Essentials</h2>

<p><strong>العنوان العربي:</strong> أساسيات برمجة الشبكات مع Twisted
<strong>المؤلف:</strong> آبي فيتيغ (Abe Fettig)</p>

<p><strong>لماذا هو سر؟</strong>
عندما يتعلق الأمر بالبرمجة غير المتزامنة في بايثون، فإن <code class="highlighter-rouge">AsyncIO</code> يسرق كل الأضواء. لكن قبل <code class="highlighter-rouge">AsyncIO</code> بسنوات، كان هناك <strong>Twisted</strong>، وهو إطار عمل ناضج وقوي للغاية للشبكات يحركها الحدث (event-driven). لا يزال Twisted يستخدم في تطبيقات عالية الأداء وهو مثال رائع على تصميم البرامج غير المتزامنة.</p>

<p><strong>أهم الميزات:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>مدفوع بالحدث:</strong> يعلمك طريقة تفكير مختلفة تماماً عن البرمجة المتسلسلة التقليدية.</li>
  <li><strong>البطاريات متضمنة:</strong> يوفر تطبيقات جاهزة لبروتوكولات الشبكة الشائعة (HTTP, FTP, SSH, 등).</li>
  <li><strong>تصميم قوي:</strong> يعتمد على مفاهيم مثل <code class="highlighter-rouge">Deferreds</code> (المؤجلات) التي كانت مصدر إلهام لـ <code class="highlighter-rouge">Promises</code> و <code class="highlighter-rouge">Futures</code> الحديثة.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>كيف يمنحك الأفضلية؟</strong>
تعلم Twisted لا يعلمك مجرد إطار عمل آخر؛ إنه يعلمك <strong>المبادئ الأولى للبرمجة غير المتزامنة</strong>. فهمك لـ Twisted سيجعل فهمك لـ <code class="highlighter-rouge">AsyncIO</code> أو أي إطار عمل غير متزامن آخر أعمق بعشر مرات. إنه يظهر أنك مطور يفهم تاريخ وتقنيات مجاله بعمق.</p>

<p class="story-content page-10 page-type-list anim-fade-in"><strong>أين تجده؟</strong>
الكتاب متاح للشراء من O’Reilly. وثائق Twisted الرسمية أيضاً ممتازة وتعتبر مصدراً رائعاً للتعلم.</p>

<p>في عالم تطوير البرمجيات، هناك حقيقة لا يناقشها الكثيرون بصوت عالٍ: معظم معسكرات التدريب والدورات التعليمية عبر الإنترنت تُعدّك لتكون <strong>بنّاءً</strong>، لا <strong>مهندس حصون</strong>. يعلمونك كيف تبني الميزات، وكيف تكتب الشيفرة التي ‘تعمل’، لكنهم نادرًا ما يخبرونك عن الجانب المظلم… عن كيفية تحطيم كل ما بنيته.</p>

<p>كبار المطورين، أولئك الذين يشيدون الأنظمة التي تدير ملايين العمليات وتخزن بيانات حساسة، يعرفون سرًا: <strong>الشيفرة التي تعمل ليست بالضرورة شيفرة آمنة</strong>. إنهم يفهمون أن كل سطر يكتبونه قد يكون ثغرة محتملة. هذا الفهم لا يأتي من دورات “بايثون من الصفر إلى الاحتراف”، بل يأتي من دراسة عقلية المهاجم، ومن فهم عميق لكيفية بناء أنظمة صلبة وقادرة على الصمود.</p>

<p>هذه المعرفة هي الخط الفاصل بين المطور المبتدئ والخبير الحقيقي. اليوم، سنكشف عن قائمة الكتب التي تشكل هذا الخط الفاصل.</p>

<blockquote class="story-author-note anim-fade-in">
  <p><strong>الحقيقة الصادمة</strong>: معرفتك ببايثون لا تكتمل أبدًا إذا كنت تعرف فقط كيف تبني، وليس كيف تحمي ما بنيته. هذه الكتب هي خارطة الطريق للجانب الآخر من المعرفة.</p>

<h2 class="story-heading anim-slide-up" id="السر-الذي-لا-يُقال-البرمجة-الدفاعية-تبدأ-بالهجوم">السر الذي لا يُقال: البرمجة الدفاعية تبدأ بالهجوم</h2>

<p>لماذا يخفي كبار المطورين هذه المصادر؟ ليس عن قصد بالضرورة. السبب هو أن هذه المعرفة متخصصة وتتطلب عقلية مختلفة. من الأسهل تعليم كيفية استخدام <code class="highlighter-rouge">requests</code> لجلب البيانات، من تعليم كيفية حماية تطبيقك من هجمات <code class="highlighter-rouge">Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)</code> التي تستغل نفس المكتبة.</p>

<p>معظم المطورين يركزون على <strong>الوظائف (Features)</strong>، بينما يركز الخبراء على <strong>الخصائص غير الوظيفية (Non-Functional Requirements)</strong> مثل الأمان، والأداء، وقابلية التوسع. هذه الكتب هي بوابتك لهذا العالم. إنها تعلمك أن تفكر في كل مدخل للمستخدم كسلاح محتمل، وكل اعتمادية (dependency) كحصان طروادة.</p>

<p>هذه ليست مجرد كتب برمجة، إنها كتب استراتيجية. تعلمك كيف تفكر بثلاث خطوات للأمام، تمامًا مثل لاعب الشطرنج المحترف.</p>

  <li><strong>المؤلفون</strong>: Justin Seitz (جاستن سايتس) &amp; Tim Arnold (تيم أرنولد)</li>
  <li><strong>الترجمة الحرفية</strong>: بايثون القبعة السوداء</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>لماذا هو سر؟</strong>
هذا الكتاب هو الدليل العملي لتعلم “عقلية المهاجم”. كبار المطورين لا يقرؤونه ليصبحوا قراصنة، بل ليفهموا كيف يفكر القراصنة. إنه يعلمك كيف تستخدم بايثون، اللغة التي تحبها، لإنشاء أدوات هجومية، واكتشاف الثغرات، والتسلل إلى الشبكات. عندما تعرف كيف تُصنع الأسلحة، تصبح أفضل في صناعة الدروع.</p>

<p><strong>أهم الميزات:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>أمثلة عملية حقيقية</strong>: يعلمك الكتاب كيفية إنشاء تروجان (حصان طروادة) باستخدام GitHub، واعتراض بيانات الشبكة، وتنفيذ هجمات تصعيد الامتيازات.</li>
  <li><strong>تحديثات للعصر الحديث</strong>: يغطي الإصدار الثاني بايثون 3 وتقنيات الهجوم الحديثة، مما يجعله ذا صلة مباشرة باليوم.</li>
  <li><strong>من الهجوم إلى الدفاع</strong>: كل فصل تقرأه عن الهجوم يمنحك رؤى لا تقدر بثمن حول كيفية بناء دفاعاتك.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>كيف يمنحك الأفضلية؟</strong>
خريج المعسكر التدريبي يعرف كيف يبني واجهة برمجة تطبيقات (API). أنت، بعد قراءة هذا الكتاب، ستعرف كيف يمكن استغلال هذه الواجهة بعشر طرق مختلفة، وبالتالي، كيف تحصنها.</p>

<blockquote class="story-author-note anim-fade-in">
  <p><strong>رأيي الشخصي</strong>: هذا الكتاب هو جرعة الأدرينالين التي تحتاجها لتستيقظ من غفلة “البرمجة السعيدة”. سيجعلك تشك في كل سطر برمجي تكتبه، وهذا أمر جيد.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>المؤلف</strong>: Julien Danjou (جوليان دانجو)</li>
  <li><strong>الترجمة الحرفية</strong>: بايثون الجاد</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>لماذا هو سر؟</strong>
لأن معظم المطورين يتوقفون عند مرحلة “الشيفرة تعمل”. هذا الكتاب يبدأ من هناك. إنه لا يتحدث عن بناء جملة بايثون، بل عن بناء <strong>مشاريع بايثون احترافية ومحصنة</strong>. الأمن ليس مجرد فصل في هذا الكتاب، بل هو فلسفة منسوجة في كل صفحة، من هيكلة المشروع إلى النشر والتعامل مع الأخطاء.</p>

<p><strong>أهم الميزات:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>ما بعد الشيفرة</strong>: يغطي الكتاب تصميم الـ API، وإدارة الوحدات، والنشر، والتوزيع، وقابلية التوسع، وكلها جوانب تؤثر بشكل مباشر على أمان التطبيق.</li>
  <li><strong>فصول عن الأمان</strong>: يحتوي على فصول مخصصة مباشرة للأمان، تشرح كيفية التعامل مع الثغرات الشائعة وتطبيق أفضل الممارسات.</li>
  <li><strong>تركيز على الصلابة (Robustness)</strong>: يعلمك كيفية كتابة شيفرة لا تنهار عند أول إدخال غير متوقع، وهو خط الدفاع الأول ضد العديد من الهجمات.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>كيف يمنحك الأفضلية؟</strong>
المطور العادي يسلم شيفرة. أنت ستسلم نظامًا كاملاً، مصممًا ليكون قويًا وآمنًا وقابلاً للصيانة. هذا الكتاب يعلمك عقلية مهندس البرمجيات، وليس مجرد مبرمج.</p>

<blockquote class="story-author-note anim-fade-in">
  <p><strong>رأيي الشخصي</strong>: إذا كان “Black Hat Python” يعلمك الهجوم، فإن “Serious Python” يعلمك بناء القلعة التي لا يمكن اختراقها. إنه الدليل العملي لتحويل مشاريعك من مجرد نصوص برمجية إلى منتجات برمجية حقيقية.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>المؤلف</strong>: José Manuel Ortega (خوسيه مانويل أورتيجا)</li>
  <li><strong>الترجمة الحرفية</strong>: نفس العنوان.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>لماذا هو سر؟</strong>
لأن أمن التطبيقات لا ينفصل عن أمن الشبكات. هذا الكتاب يردم الفجوة بين عالمي تطوير البرمجيات وأمن الشبكات باستخدام بايثون. بينما يركز المطورون على منطق التطبيق، يتجاهلون غالبًا كيفية انتقال البيانات عبر الشبكة، حيث تكمن العديد من المخاطر.</p>

<p><strong>أهم الميزات:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>الأتمتة الأمنية</strong>: يعلمك كيفية أتمتة المهام الأمنية، مثل فحص الشبكات، وتحليل الحزم (packet analysis)، وبناء أدوات مراقبة أمنية خاصة بك.</li>
  <li><strong>من الدفاع إلى الهجوم</strong>: يغطي الكتاب كلاً من التقنيات الدفاعية (مثل بناء جدران الحماية) والتقنيات الهجومية (مثل استغلال خدمات الشبكة).</li>
  <li><strong>مكتبات متخصصة</strong>: ستتعمق في مكتبات مثل <code class="highlighter-rouge">Scapy</code> لتحليل الحزم و<code class="highlighter-rouge">Nmap</code> لفحص الشبكات، وكل ذلك من خلال بايثون.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>كيف يمنحك الأفضلية؟</strong>
ستكون قادرًا على بناء تطبيقات “واعية بالشبكة”. لن تكون مجرد مطور تطبيقات، بل مطور يفهم البنية التحتية التي يعمل عليها تطبيقه، مما يمنحك القدرة على اكتشاف وتخفيف التهديدات التي لا يراها الآخرون.</p>

<blockquote class="story-author-note anim-fade-in">
  <p><strong>رأيي الشخصي</strong>: هذا الكتاب يحولك من مجرد طاهٍ يعد وجبة (التطبيق) إلى خبير تغذية يفهم كيف يؤثر كل مكون (حزمة بيانات) على الجسم بأكمله (الشبكة). إنها معرفة عميقة وقوية.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>المؤلف</strong>: Michal Zalewski (ميكال زاليفسكي)</li>
  <li><strong>الترجمة الحرفية</strong>: نفس العنوان.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>لماذا هو سر؟</strong>
لأنه ليس كتاب بايثون! وهذه هي الخدعة. كبار مطوري بايثون (خاصة في مجال الويب) يعرفون أن أمن الويب هو تخصص بحد ذاته، ومبادئه تتجاوز أي لغة برمجة. هذا الكتاب، الذي كتبه أحد أشهر باحثي الأمن في العالم، هو “الكتاب المقدس” لأمن متصفحات الويب.</p>

<p><strong>أهم الميزات:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>محايد لغوياً</strong>: يشرح الكتاب الثغرات الأساسية في بنية الويب نفسها (مثل XSS, CSRF, SOP) بطريقة تجعلك تفهم “لماذا” تحدث، وليس فقط “كيف” تمنعها في Django أو Flask.</li>
  <li><strong>عمق تقني هائل</strong>: يغوص الكتاب في تفاصيل دقيقة حول كيفية عمل المتصفحات، ومعايير HTTP، وسياسات الأمان التي يعتمد عليها كل مطور ويب دون أن يفهمها حقًا.</li>
  <li><strong>عقلية الباحث الأمني</strong>: يعلمك كيف تنظر إلى تطبيق الويب الخاص بك من منظور المتصفح والمهاجم، وليس فقط من منظور الخادم.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>كيف يمنحك الأفضلية؟</strong>
عندما يواجه مطور آخر ثغرة أمنية في الويب، سيبحث عن حل سريع في Stack Overflow. أنت، بعد قراءة هذا الكتاب، ستفهم السبب الجذري للمشكلة على مستوى البروتوكول، مما يمكنك من كتابة شيفرة تمنع فئة كاملة من الثغرات من الحدوث في المقام الأول.</p>

<blockquote class="story-author-note anim-fade-in">
  <p><strong>رأيي الشخصي</strong>: قراءة هذا الكتاب لمطور ويب بايثون تشبه دراسة عالم التشريح لطبيب جراح. قد لا تستخدم كل المعلومات كل يوم، لكنها تغير بشكل أساسي فهمك لكيفية عمل كل شيء، وتجعل قراراتك أكثر دقة وأمانًا.</p>

<h2 class="story-heading anim-slide-up" id="الخلاصة-المعرفة-هي-درعك-الأقوى">الخلاصة: المعرفة هي درعك الأقوى</h2>

<p>الخيط المشترك بين هذه الكتب هو أنها تدفعك خارج “منطقة الراحة” الخاصة بك كمطور. إنها تجبرك على التفكير في الفشل، في الهجوم، وفي نقاط الضعف. وهذه هي الطريقة الوحيدة لبناء برمجيات قوية حقًا.</p>

<p>كبار المطورين لا يمتلكون قدرات سحرية، بل يمتلكون مكتبة أوسع من النماذج العقلية. إنهم لا يرون الشيفرة البرمجية كتعليمات للحاسوب فحسب، بل كسطح هجوم محتمل، كعقد اجتماعي مع المستخدم، وكجزء من نظام بيئي أكبر.</p>

<p>هذه الكتب هي بوابتك لتطوير تلك النماذج العقلية. إنها الاستثمار الذي يميز بين من يكتب الشيفرة، ومن يهندس البرمجيات.</p>

<p><strong>الخطوة التالية لك</strong>: اختر واحدًا من هذه الكتب، واقرأه، وطبقه. لا تقرأه فقط، بل جرب الأمثلة، واكتب الأدوات، وحاول اختراق تطبيقاتك التجريبية. هذه هي الطريقة التي تحول بها المعرفة إلى مهارة، والمهارة إلى خبرة.</p>

<p><strong>العنوان الأصلي:</strong> Foundations of Python Network Programming, 3rd Edition
<strong>المؤلفون:</strong> براندون رودس (Brandon Rhodes) وجون غورزن (John Goerzen)</p>

<p>هذا ليس مجرد كتاب، بل هو حجر الأساس. بينما تعلمك الدورات استخدام مكتبة <code class="highlighter-rouge">requests</code>، يعلمك هذا الكتاب كيف تعمل <code class="highlighter-rouge">requests</code> من الداخل. إنه يغوص عميقاً في <strong>المقابس (Sockets)</strong>، و <strong>بروتوكولات TCP/IP</strong>، وكيفية بناء خوادم وعملاء من الصفر.</p>

<p><strong>ما يخبرك به كبار المطورين سراً:</strong> فهم هذه الأساسيات هو ما يسمح لك بتشخيص المشاكل المعقدة في الشبكة التي تحير الآخرين. عندما يفشل كل شيء، ستعرف أين تبحث لأنك تفهم اللغة التي تتحدث بها أجهزة الكمبيوتر حقًا.</p>

<p><strong>ميزات رئيسية:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>تغطية شاملة لبروتوكولات الإنترنت الأساسية (TCP, UDP, DNS, SMTP).</li>
  <li>أمثلة عملية لبناء خوادم وعملاء شبكة منخفضة المستوى.</li>
  <li>تحديثات للطبعة الثالثة لتشمل بايثون 3 بشكل كامل.</li>

  <li>مقدمة مركزة ومكثفة لإطار عمل معقد.</li>
  <li>يغطي بناء البروتوكولات، والعملاء، والخوادم.</li>
  <li>أمثلة واقعية توضح قوة البرمجة غير المتزامنة.</li>
</ul>

<p class="story-content page-4 page-type-list anim-fade-in"><strong>كيف تحصل عليه:</strong> متاح للشراء. الأهم من ذلك، أن توثيق Twisted الرسمي واسع جدًا ويعتبر كتابًا في حد ذاته.</p>

<blockquote class="story-author-note anim-fade-in">
  <p>تعلم Twisted اليوم يشبه دراسة اللاتينية لفهم اللغات الحديثة. قد لا تستخدمه يوميًا، لكنه سيجعل فهمك لـ <code class="highlighter-rouge">asyncio</code> أعمق بعشر مرات.</p>

<strong>المؤلفون:</strong> كاسون إندراسيري (Kasun Indrasiri) و دانيش كوروبو (Danesh Kuruppu)</p>

<p>واجهات برمجة التطبيقات RESTful رائعة، لكنها ليست دائمًا الأداة الأفضل. <strong>gRPC</strong> هو إطار عمل حديث وعالي الأداء للاتصال عن بعد (RPC) من Google. إنه يستخدم HTTP/2 و Protocol Buffers لتحقيق اتصال سريع وفعال بين الخدمات، وهو مثالي للأنظمة المصغرة.</p>

<p><strong>ما يخبرك به كبار المطورين سراً:</strong> بينما لا يزال الجميع يتعلمون FastAPI و Flask، انتقل كبار المطورين بالفعل إلى تقنيات مثل gRPC لبناء العمود الفقري لأنظمتهم. تعلم gRPC يضعك في طليعة هندسة الخدمات المصغرة ويظهر أنك تفكر في الأداء والكفاءة على مستوى النظام بأكمله.</p>

<p><strong>ميزات رئيسية:</strong></p>
<ul>

<p><strong>العنوان بالعربية</strong>: “بايثون بطلاقة، الإصدار الثاني”
<strong>المؤلف</strong>: Luciano Ramalho (لوتشيانو راماليو)</p>

<p>هذا ليس كتابًا عن أنماط التصميم التقليدية، بل هو أعمق من ذلك. هذا الكتاب هو <strong>الكتاب المقدس للكود البايثوني (Pythonic Code)</strong>. يعلمك كيف تستخدم ميزات بايثون الفريدة—نموذج البيانات، المولدات، المزخرفات، البرمجة غير المتزامنة—لكتابة كود ليس فقط فعالاً، بل معبر وأنيق.</p>

<p><strong>ماذا يكشف من أسرار الكبار؟</strong>
كبار المطورين لا يكتبون بايثون كما لو كانت Java أو C++. إنهم “يتحدثون” اللغة بطلاقة. هذا الكتاب يعلمك تلك الطلاقة. ستكتشف لماذا <code class="highlighter-rouge">len(my_collection)</code> أفضل من <code class="highlighter-rouge">my_collection.len()</code>، وكيف تبني كائنات تتصرف تمامًا مثل أنواع بايثون المدمجة. إنه يكشف عن “الروح” الحقيقية لبايثون.</p>

<p><strong>ميزات رئيسية</strong>:</p>

<p><strong>ماذا يكشف من أسرار الكبار؟</strong>
المطورون المبتدئون يخلطون كل شيء معًا: منطق العمل، تفاصيل قاعدة البيانات، وواجهة المستخدم. والنتيجة؟ كرة من الطين لا يمكن صيانتها. كبار المطورين يبنون طبقات واضحة من التجريد. هذا الكتاب يعلمك كيف تفصل “ماذا” يفعله تطبيقك عن “كيف” يفعله. ستتعلم بناء “نموذج مجال” غني هو قلب تطبيقك، مع إبقاء تفاصيل الإطار (مثل Django أو Flask) على الأطراف.</p>

<p><strong>ميزات رئيسية</strong>:</p>

<strong>المؤلف</strong>: Doug Hellmann (دوغ هيلمان)</p>

<p>السر الذي لا يدركه الكثيرون: بايثون تأتي مع مجموعة هائلة من “البطاريات المضمنة”. قبل أن تبحث عن مكتبة خارجية، غالبًا ما يكون الحل موجودًا بالفعل في المكتبة القياسية، وهو مُحسَّن ومُختبَر جيدًا. هذا الكتاب هو جولتك الإرشادية في هذا الكنز المخفي.</p>

<p><strong>ماذا يكشف من أسرار الكبار؟</strong>
كبار المطورين لا يعيدون اختراع العجلة. إنهم يعرفون أدواتهم جيدًا. هل تحتاج إلى التعامل مع ملفات CSV معقدة؟ استخدم وحدة <code class="highlighter-rouge">csv</code>. هل تحتاج إلى إنشاء قاعدة بيانات خفيفة الوزن؟ <code class="highlighter-rouge">sqlite3</code> موجود. هل تريد التعامل مع مسارات الملفات بطريقة مستقلة عن نظام التشغيل؟ <code class="highlighter-rouge">pathlib</code> هو صديقك. هذا الكتاب يكشف عن قوة الوحدات التي ربما لم تسمع بها من قبل، مثل <code class="highlighter-rouge">itertools</code> للتعامل المتقدم مع المكررات، أو <code class="highlighter-rouge">functools</code> للبرمجة الوظيفية.</p>

<p><strong>العنوان بالعربية</strong>: “الهياكل النظيفة في بايثون، الإصدار الثاني”
<strong>المؤلف</strong>: Leonardo Giordani (ليوناردو جيورداني)</p>

<p>هذا الكتاب يأخذ مبادئ “الهندسة النظيفة” التي شاعها روبرت سي. مارتن (العم بوب) ويطبقها بشكل عملي ومباشر في عالم بايثون. إنه دليل تكتيكي لبناء تطبيقات قوية، قابلة للاختبار، ومستقلة عن الأطر وقواعد البيانات.</p>

<p><strong>ماذا يكشف من أسرار الكبار؟</strong>
يكشف سر <strong>“قاعدة انعكاس التبعية” (Dependency Inversion Principle)</strong>. المطورون المبتدئون يجعلون منطق العمل يعتمد على تفاصيل مثل قاعدة البيانات أو واجهة برمجة التطبيقات. هذا يجعل الكود هشًا وصعب الاختبار. كبار المطورين يعكسون هذا الاعتماد: التفاصيل يجب أن تعتمد على التجريدات (Interfaces)، وليس العكس. يعلمك هذا الكتاب كيفية استخدام التجريد لفصل منطق عملك الأساسي عن العالم الخارجي الفوضوي.</p>

<p><strong>ميزات رئيسية</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>عملي وموجز</strong>: يركز على التطبيق العملي للمبادئ بدلاً من التنظير الطويل.</li>
  <li><strong>أمثلة بايثونية</strong>: يوضح كيفية تطبيق المفاهيم باستخدام ميزات بايثون مثل <code class="highlighter-rouge">dataclasses</code> و <code class="highlighter-rouge">typing</code>.</li>
  <li><strong>تركيز على الاختبار</strong>: يوضح كيف أن الهندسة النظيفة تجعل اختبار الوحدات (Unit Testing) سهلاً للغاية.</li>

<p><strong>ماذا يكشف من أسرار الكبار؟</strong>
كبار المطورين لا يحلون كل مشكلة من الصفر. إنهم يتعرفون على “شكل” المشكلة ويطبقون “نمطًا” مجربًا ومختبرًا لحلها. هذا الكتاب يعلمك لغة التصميم المشتركة هذه. ستتعلم متى تستخدم نمط المصنع (Factory) بدلاً من المُنشئ المباشر، وكيف يبسط نمط الواجهة (Facade) نظامًا معقدًا، ولماذا يعد نمط المراقب (Observer) مثاليًا للتطبيقات التفاعلية.</p>

<p><strong>ميزات رئيسية</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>تغطية واسعة</strong>: يغطي الأنماط الإنشائية (Creational)، الهيكلية (Structural)، والسلوكية (Behavioral)، بالإضافة إلى أنماط أخرى.</li>
  <li><strong>أمثلة من العالم الحقيقي</strong>: يربط كل نمط بسيناريو عملي يمكنك أن تتخيله.</li>
  <li><strong>تحديثات بايثون الحديثة</strong>: الإصدار الثالث يتضمن استخدامات لميزات بايثون الحديثة مثل <code class="highlighter-rouge">asyncio</code> و <code class="highlighter-rouge">dataclasses</code>.</li>

<p>هذا الكتاب ليس عن الأنماط المعمارية الكبيرة، بل عن الأنماط الصغيرة والأنيقة على مستوى الكود. إنه مجموعة من “الوصفات” التي توضح طرقًا ذكية وموجزة وفعالة لحل المشاكل اليومية الصغيرة بطريقة بايثونية.</p>

<p><strong>ماذا يكشف من أسرار الكبار؟</strong>
يكشف أن الأناقة تكمن في التفاصيل. كبار المطورين مهووسون بكتابة كود ليس فقط صحيحًا، بل جميلًا أيضًا. هذا الكتاب مليء بالتعابير الاصطلاحية (idioms) التي تجعل الكود أقصر وأكثر قابلية للقراءة. ستتعلم حيلًا لاستخدام <code class="highlighter-rouge">itertools</code>، و <code class="highlighter-rouge">collections</code>، و comprehensions بطرق لم تفكر بها من قبل.</p>

<p><strong>ميزات رئيسية</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>موجز ومباشر</strong>: كل وصفة هي حل لمشكلة صغيرة ومحددة.</li>
  <li><strong>تركيز على القراءة</strong>: يعلمك كيف تكتب كودًا يفهمه الآخرون بسهولة.</li>
  <li><strong>ممتع</strong>: قراءته ممتعة وتجعلك ترغب في تجربة هذه الحيل على الفور.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>كيف تحصل عليه؟</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>شراء</strong>: متاح على Real Python كجزء من عضويتهم.</li>
  <li><strong>مجاناً</strong>: العديد من هذه الوصفات مستوحاة من المقالات والدروس المجانية المتاحة على موقع Real Python.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>العنوان بالعربية</strong>: “أنماط التصميم في بايثون”
<strong>المؤلف</strong>: Alexander Shvets (ألكسندر شفيتس)</p>

<p>ما يميز هذا الكتاب هو بساطته وتركيزه البصري. إذا كانت الكتب الأخرى تبدو أكاديمية جدًا، فهذا الكتاب هو نقطة الدخول المثالية لعالم أنماط التصميم. يشرح كل نمط من أنماط GoF الـ 23 بمصطلحات بسيطة، ورسوم توضيحية واضحة، وأمثلة كود بايثون مباشرة.</p>

<p><strong>ماذا يكشف من أسرار الكبار؟</strong>
يكشف أن أنماط التصميم ليست مفاهيم مخيفة ومعقدة. إنها حلول منطقية لمشاكل شائعة. هذا الكتاب يزيل الغموض عن مصطلحات مثل “Singleton” و “Decorator” و “Visitor”، ويظهر لك أنها مجرد أسماء لأفكار ربما تكون قد استخدمتها بالفعل دون أن تعرف. إنه يمنحك المفردات اللازمة للتحدث عن تصميم البرمجيات بثقة.</p>

<p><strong>ميزات رئيسية</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>بصري للغاية</strong>: كل نمط مصحوب برسوم UML ومخططات توضح العلاقات.</li>
  <li><strong>سهل الفهم</strong>: اللغة بسيطة ومباشرة، وتتجنب المصطلحات المعقدة.</li>
  <li><strong>تفاعلي</strong>: الموقع المصاحب (<code class="highlighter-rouge">refactoring.guru</code>) يقدم نسخة تفاعلية من المحتوى.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>كيف تحصل عليه؟</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>شراء</strong>: يمكنك شراء نسخة PDF أو e-book من الموقع الرسمي.</li>
  <li><strong>مجاناً</strong>: المحتوى الكامل للكتاب متاح مجانًا على موقع <code class="highlighter-rouge">refactoring.guru</code>، مما يجعله مصدرًا لا يقدر بثمن.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote class="story-author-note anim-fade-in story-content page-10 page-type-text anim-fade-in">
  <p>هذا الكتاب هو الجسر المثالي بين النظرية والتطبيق. إنه يثبت أنك لست بحاجة إلى درجة دكتوراه في علوم الكمبيوتر لفهم وتطبيق مبادئ التصميم القوية.</p>

<h2 class="story-heading anim-slide-up" id="الخاتمة-من-كاتب-كود-إلى-مهندس">الخاتمة: من كاتب كود إلى مهندس</h2>

<p>الفجوة بينك وبين المطورين الكبار ليست فجوة معرفة، بل فجوة عقلية. إنهم لا يعرفون فقط “كيف” يكتبون الكود، بل يفهمون “لماذا” يكتبونه بطريقة معينة. هذه الكتب هي مفتاحك لفك شفرة هذه العقلية.</p>

<p class="story-content page-final page-type-text anim-fade-in">لا تقرأها فقط. ادرسها. طبقها. تحدَّ كودك القديم. في البداية، ستشعر بالبطء وعدم الارتياح. هذا طبيعي. إنها علامة على أن عقلك ينمو. ومع مرور الوقت، ستجد نفسك تبني أنظمة لم تكن تحلم بها من قبل، وستنظر إلى الوراء وتدرك أنك لم تعد مجرد كاتب كود، بل أصبحت مهندس برمجيات حقيقيًا.</p>
