            <blockquote><p>This is a copy of an email I used to send internally at work and now
<a href="https://lists.torproject.org/mailman3/hyperkitty/list/tor-project@lists.torproject.org/thread/HR3ISDIVLOR5NNAN24F2TCHMPHFOI2XR/">made public</a>. I'm not sure I'll make a habit of posting it here,
especially not <em>twice a year</em>, unless people really like it. Right
now, it's mostly here to keep with my current writing spree going.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is your bi-yearly reminder that time is changing soon!</p>

<h1 id="whats-happening">What's happening?</h1>

<p>For people not on tor-internal, you should know that I've been sending
semi-regular announcements when daylight saving changes occur. Starting
now, I'm making those announcements public so they can be shared with
the wider community because, after all, this affects everyone (kind of).</p>

<p>For those of you lucky enough to have no idea what I'm talking about,
you should know that some places in the world implement what is called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time">Daylight saving time or DST</a>.</p>

<p>Normally, you shouldn't have to do anything: computers automatically
change time following local rules, assuming they are correctly
configured, provided recent updates have been applied in the case of a
recent change in said rules (because yes, this happens).</p>

<p>Appliances, of course, will likely <em>not</em> change time and will need to
adjusted unless they are so-called "smart" (also known as "part of a bot
net").</p>

<p>If your clock is flashing "0:00" or "12:00", you have no action to take,
congratulations on having the right time once or twice a day.</p>

<p>If you haven't changed those clocks in six months, congratulations, they
will be accurate again!</p>

<p>In any case, you should still consider DST because it might affect some
of your meeting schedules, particularly if you set up a new meeting
schedule in the last 6 months and forgot to consider this
change.</p>

<h1 id="if-your-location-does-not-have-dst">If your location does not have DST</h1>

<p>Properly scheduled meetings affecting multiple time zones are set in UTC
time, which does <em>not</em> change. So if your location does not observer
time changes, your (local!) meeting time will <em>not</em> change.</p>

<p>But be aware that some other folks attending your meeting <em>might</em> have
the DST bug and <em>their</em> meeting times will change. They might miss
entire meetings or arrive late as you frantically ping them over IRC,
Matrix, Signal, SMS, Ricochet, Mattermost, SimpleX, Whatsapp, Discord,
Slack, Wechat, Snapchat, Telegram, XMPP, Briar, Zulip, RocketChat,
DeltaChat, talk(1), write(1), actual telegrams, Meshtastic, Meshcore,
Reticulum, APRS, snail mail, and, finally, flying a remote presence
drone to their house, asking what's going on.</p>

<p>(Sorry if I forgot your preferred messaging client here, I tried my
best.)</p>

<p>Be kind; those poor folks might be more sleep deprived as DST <em>steals</em>
one hour of sleep from them on the night that implements the change.</p>

<h1 id="if-you-do-observe-dst">If you do observe DST</h1>

<p>If you are affected by the DST bug, your <em>local</em> meeting times <em>will</em>
change access the board. Normally, you can trust that your meetings are
scheduled to take this change into account and the new time should still
be reasonable.</p>

<p>Trust, but verify; make sure the new times <em>are</em> adequate and there are
no scheduling conflicts.</p>

<p>Do this <em>now</em>: take a look at your calendar in two week <em>and</em> in
April. See if any meeting need to be rescheduled because of an
impossible or conflicting time.</p>

<h1 id="when-does-time-change-how-and-where">When does time change, how and where?</h1>

<p>Notice how I mentioned "North America" in the subject? That's a
lie. ("The doctor lies", as they say on the BBC.) Other places,
including Europe, also changes times, just not all at once (and not all
North America).</p>

<p>We'll get into "where" soon, but first let's look at the "how". As you might
already know, the trick is:</p>

<blockquote><p>Spring forward, fall backwards.</p></blockquote>

<p>This northern-centric (sorry!) proverb says that clocks will move
<em>forward</em> by an hour this "spring", after moving <em>backwards</em> last
"fall". This is why we lose an hour of work, sorry, sleep. It sucks, to
put it bluntly. I want it to stop and will keep writing those advisories
until it does.</p>

<p>To see where and when, we, unfortunately, still need to go into politics.</p>

<h2 id="usa-and-canada">USA and Canada</h2>

<p>First, we start with "North America" which, really, is just some <em>parts</em>
of USA[1] and Canada[2]. As usual, on the Second Sunday in March (the
8th) at 02:00 local (not UTC!), the clocks will move forward.</p>

<p>This means that properly set clocks will flip from 1:59 to 3:00, coldly
depriving us from an hour of sleep that was perniciously granted 6
months ago and making calendar software stupidly hard to write.</p>

<p>Practically, set your wrist watch and alarm clocks[3] back one hour
before going to bed and go to bed early.</p>

<p>[1] except Arizona (except the Navajo nation), US territories, and
    Hawaii</p>

<p>[2] except Yukon, most of Saskatchewan, and parts of British Columbia
    (northeast), one island in Nunavut (Southampton Island), one town in
    Ontario (Atikokan) and small parts of Quebec (Le
    Golfe-du-Saint-Laurent), a list which I keep recopying because I
    find it just so amazing how chaotic it is. When your clock has its
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_Saskatchewan">own Wikipedia page</a>, you know something is wrong.</p>

<p>[3] hopefully not managed by a botnet, otherwise kindly ask your bot net
    operator to apply proper software upgrades in a timely manner</p>

<h2 id="europe">Europe</h2>

<p>Next we look at our dear Europe, which will change time on the last
Sunday in March (the 29th) at 01:00 <em>UTC</em> (not local!). I <em>think</em> it
means that, Amsterdam-time, the clocks will flip from 1:59 to 3:00 AM
<em>local</em> on that night.</p>

<p>(Every time I write this, I have doubts. I would welcome independent
confirmation from night owls that observe that funky behavior
experimentally.)</p>

<p>Just like your poor fellows out west, just fix your old-school clocks
before going to bed, and go to sleep early, it's good for you.</p>

<h2 id="rest-of-the-world-with-dst">Rest of the world with DST</h2>

<p>Renewed and recurring apologies again to the people of Cuba, Mexico,
Moldova, Israel, Lebanon, Palestine, Egypt, Chile (except Magallanes
Region), parts of Australia, and New Zealand which <em>all</em> have their own
<em>individual</em> DST rules, omitted here for brevity.</p>

<p>In general, changes also happen in March, but either on different
times or different days, except in the south hemisphere, where they
happen in April.</p>

<h2 id="rest-of-the-world-without-dst">Rest of the world without DST</h2>

<p>All of you other folks without DST, rejoice! Thank you for reminding us
how manage calendars and clocks normally. Sometimes, doing nothing is
precisely the right thing to do. You're an inspiration for us all.</p>

<h1 id="changes-since-last-time">Changes since last time</h1>

<p>There were, again, no changes since last year on daylight savings that
I'm aware of. It seems the <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2026/02/19/daylight-act-of-2026-proposing-half-daylight-saving-time/88760725007/">US congress debating switching to a
"half-daylight" time zone</a> which is an half-baked idea that I
should have expected from the current USA politics.</p>

<p>The plan is to, say, switch from "Eastern is UTC-4 in the summer" to
"Eastern is UTC-4.5". The bill also proposes to do this 90 days after
enactment, which is dangerously optimistic about our capacity at
deploying any significant change in human society.</p>

<p>In general, I rely on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time_by_country">Wikipedia time nerds</a> for this and Paul
Eggert which seems to singlehandledly be keeping everything in order
for all of us, on the <a href="https://lists.iana.org/hyperkitty/list/tz-announce@iana.org/latest">tz-announce mailing list</a>.</p>

<p>This time, I've also looked at the <a href="https://lists.iana.org/hyperkitty/list/tz@iana.org/latest">tz mailing list</a> which is where
I learned about the congress bill.</p>

<p>If your country has changed time and no one above noticed, now would
be an extremely late time to do something about this, typically
writing to the above list. (Incredibly, <em>I</em> need to write to the list
because of <a href="https://lists.iana.org/hyperkitty/list/tz@iana.org/thread/6HN5SWD2BJA7OVTPFR3VB42JIA6PFLPG/">this post</a>.)</p>

<p>One thing that <em>did</em> change since last year is that I've implemented
what I hope to be a robust calendar for this, which was surprisingly
tricky.</p>

<p>If you have access to our Nextcloud, it should be visible under the
heading "Daylight saving times". If you don't, you can access it using
<a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/tpa/team/-/wikis/howto/time/dst.ics">this direct link</a>.</p>

<p>The procedures around how this calendar was created, how this email
was written, and curses found along the way, are also documented in
<a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/tpa/team/-/wikis/howto/time">this wiki page</a>, if someone ever needs to pick up the Time Lord
duty.</p>

<p><strong>Michael #4: <a href="https://github.com/nektos/act?featured_on=pythonbytes">act - run your GitHub actions locally</a></strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Run your <a href="https://developer.github.com/actions/?featured_on=pythonbytes">GitHub Actions</a> locally! Why would you want to do this? Two reasons:
<ul>
<li><strong>Fast Feedback</strong> - Rather than having to commit/push every time you want to test out the changes you are making to your <code>.github/workflows/</code> files (or for any changes to embedded GitHub actions), you can use <code>act</code> to run the actions locally. The <a href="https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/using-environment-variables#default-environment-variables">environment variables</a> and <a href="https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/virtual-environments-for-github-hosted-runners#filesystems-on-github-hosted-runners">filesystem</a> are all configured to match what GitHub provides.</li>
<li><strong>Local Task Runner</strong> - I love <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)?featured_on=pythonbytes">make</a>. However, I also hate repeating myself. With <code>act</code>, you can use the GitHub Actions defined in your <code>.github/workflows/</code> to replace your <code>Makefile</code>!</li>
</ul></li>
<li>When you run <code>act</code> it reads in your GitHub Actions from <code>.github/workflows/</code> and determines the set of actions that need to be run.
<ul>
<li>Uses the Docker API to either pull or build the necessary images, as defined in your workflow files and finally determines the execution path based on the dependencies that were defined.</li>
<li>Once it has the execution path, it then uses the Docker API to run containers for each action based on the images prepared earlier.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/using-environment-variables#default-environment-variables">environment variables</a> and <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners#file-systems">filesystem</a> are all configured to match what GitHub provides.</li>

            Introduction Over the past ten years or so, my role has gradually shifted from software to platforms. More towards the &lsquo;ops&rsquo; side of things, but coming from a background that values APIs, automation, artifacts and guardrails in the form of automated tests.
And I found out that a lot of best practices from software engineering can be adapted and applied to modern ops practices as well.
DevOps in a nutshell really: Bridging the gap between Dev and Ops.

            <p>في 2026، لم يعد المستخدم العادي يبحث عن موقع إلكتروني “يعمل” فقط، بل يبحث عن تجربة “تُدهشه” وتتفاعل معه. الفرق بين تطبيق ناجح وآخر منسي يكمن غالبًا في جودة هذه التجربة: هل الواجهة سهلة وممتعة؟ هل البيانات المعقدة معروضة بشكل بسيط وجذاب؟</p>

<p>هنا يظهر دور جديد ومطلوب بشدة في سوق العمل: <strong>صانع التجارب التفاعلية</strong>. هذا ليس مجرد مطور واجهة أمامية، بل هو فنان رقمي ومهندس يجمع بين دقة البرمجة، وإبداع التصميم، وقوة سرد القصص عبر البيانات.</p>

<p>هذه التدوينة هي خارطة طريقك العملية لتصبح هذا الشخص. لقد اخترنا لك 5 شهادات مجانية متكاملة، تعمل معًا لتمنحك المهارات التقنية والإبداعية اللازمة لبناء تجارب رقمية لا تُنسى.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="خارطة-الطريق-لبناء-التجارب-التفاعلية"><strong>خارطة الطريق لبناء التجارب التفاعلية</strong></h3>

<p>تتكون رحلتك من أربع خطوات أساسية، كل خطوة تبني على التي قبلها لتكوين مجموعة مهارات فريدة.</p>

<h4 id="الخطوة-الأولى-بناء-اللوحة-القماشية---إتقان-أساسيات-الويب"><strong>الخطوة الأولى: بناء اللوحة القماشية - إتقان أساسيات الويب</strong></h4>

<p>قبل أن ترسم تحفتك الفنية، تحتاج إلى لوحة قماشية وألوان أساسية. في عالم الويب، هذه الأساسيات هي HTML و CSS و JavaScript.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>الشهادة المقترحة (1):</strong> <strong>Responsive Web Design</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>لماذا هذه الشهادة؟</strong> لأنها تعلمك كيفية بناء هيكل صفحات الويب (HTML) وتصميمها بشكل جميل ومتجاوب مع جميع الشاشات (CSS). ستبني 5 مشاريع حقيقية لترسيخ هذه المهارة.</li>

<h4 id="الخطوة-الثانية-إضافة-الحركة-والحياة---بناء-الواجهات-الديناميكية"><strong>الخطوة الثانية: إضافة الحركة والحياة - بناء الواجهات الديناميكية</strong></h4>

<p>الآن بعد أن أتقنت الأساسيات، حان الوقت لتعلم الأدوات الحديثة التي تبني بها التطبيقات السريعة والمعقدة التي نراها اليوم.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>الشهادة المقترحة:</strong> <strong>Front-End Development Libraries</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>لماذا هذه الشهادة؟</strong> لأنها تركز على <strong>React</strong>، أشهر مكتبة لبناء واجهات المستخدم في العالم. تعلمك React سيسمح لك ببناء تطبيقات أحادية الصفحة (SPAs) سريعة ومعقدة بسهولة، وهي المهارة الأساسية لأي مطور واجهة أمامية حديث.</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="الخطوة-الثالثة-جعل-البيانات-تنطق---فن-تصور-البيانات"><strong>الخطوة الثالثة: جعل البيانات تنطق - فن تصور البيانات</strong></h4>

<p>هذه هي الخطوة التي تميزك حقًا وتجعلك “صانع تجارب”. هنا تحول الأرقام والبيانات الجافة إلى قصص مرئية تفاعلية ومفهومة.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>الشهادة المقترحة:</strong> <strong>Data Visualization</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>لماذا هذه الشهادة؟</strong> لأنها تعلمك استخدام مكتبة <strong>D3.js</strong>، وهي الأداة الأقوى في العالم لإنشاء تصورات بيانات مخصصة وتفاعلية على الويب. لن تكون مقيدًا بالرسوم البيانية التقليدية، بل ستتمكن من بناء أي شيء يخطر ببالك، من الخرائط التفاعلية إلى المخططات المتحركة.</li>

    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="الخطوة-الرابعة-التفكير-بعقل-المستخدم---أساسيات-تجربة-المستخدم-ux"><strong>الخطوة الرابعة: التفكير بعقل المستخدم - أساسيات تجربة المستخدم (UX)</strong></h4>

<p>اللمسة الأخيرة التي تجمع كل شيء معًا هي فهم احتياجات المستخدم. تطبيق جميل تقنيًا ولكنه صعب الاستخدام هو تطبيق فاشل.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>الشهادة المقترحة:</strong> <strong>Google UX Design Professional Certificate</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>لماذا هذه الشهادة؟</strong> لست بحاجة لأن تصبح مصممًا محترفًا، لكن فهمك لمبادئ تجربة المستخدم (UX) من هذه الشهادة المرموقة سيغير طريقة تفكيرك إلى الأبد. ستتعلم كيفية تنظيم المعلومات، تسهيل التنقل، وبناء منتجات يحبها الناس ويستمتعون باستخدامها.</li>
      <li><strong>المقدم:</strong> Google on Coursera</li>
      <li><strong>لغة الدورة:</strong> الإنجليزية (مع توفر ترجمة “subtitles” للعربية والفرنسية).</li>

    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p><strong>خاتمة: كن أنت صانع التجربة الاستثنائية</strong></p>

<p>باتباع خارطة الطريق هذه، أنت لا تجمع شهادات متفرقة، بل تبني هوية مهنية جديدة. أنت لم تعد تبني صفحات ويب، بل أصبحت تصمم تجارب رقمية. أنت الجسر بين عالم البيانات وعالم الإنسان، والمترجم الذي يحول التعقيد إلى بساطة وجمال.</p>

<p>الفرق بين موقع جيد وموقع استثنائي يكمن في التجربة التي يقدمها. ابدأ اليوم بتعلم المهارة الأولى في هذه الخارطة، وكن أنت صانع تلك التجارب الاستثنائية التي يبحث عنها الجميع.</p>

            You love building web apps with Python, and HTMX got you excited about the hypermedia approach -- let the server drive the HTML, skip the JavaScript build step, keep things simple. But then you hit that last 10%: You need Alpine.js for interactivity, your state gets out of sync, and suddenly you're juggling two unrelated libraries that weren't designed to work together.  What if there was a single 11-kilobyte framework that gave you everything HTMX and Alpine do, and more, with real-time updates, multiplayer collaboration out of the box, and performance so fast you're actually bottlenecked by the monitor's refresh rate? That's Datastar.  On this episode, I sit down with its creator Delaney Gillilan, core maintainer Ben Croker, and Datastar convert Chris May to explore how this backend-driven, server-sent-events-first framework is changing the way full-stack developers think about the modern web.

<p>Let’s spend some time getting to know Baptiste better!</p>
<h4 id="s-can-you-tell-us-a-little-about-yourself-hobbies-education-etc">Can you tell us a little about yourself? (hobbies, education, etc)</h4>
<p>I'm a French immigrant living in Norway. In the day time I work as software engineer at <a href="https://torchbox.com/">Torchbox</a> building Django and Wagtail sites.
Education-wise I'm a "self-taught" (whatever that means) developer and started working when I was very young.
In terms of hobbies, I'm a big language nerd and I'm always up for a good etymology fact. I also enjoy the outdoor whether it's on a mountain bike or on foot (still not convinced by this skiing thing they do in Norway, but I'm trying).</p>
<h4 id="s-how-did-you-start-using-django">How did you start using Django?</h4>
<p>I was working in a startup where I had built an unmaintainable pile of custom framework-less PHP code. I'd heard of this cool Python framework and thought it would help me bring some structure to our codebase. So I started rewriting our services bit-by-bit and eventually switched everything to Django after about a year.</p>
<p>In 2012, I bought a ticket to DjangoCon Europe in Zurich and went there not knowing anyone. It was one of the best decisions of my life: the Django community welcomed me and has given me so much over the years.</p>
<h4 id="s-what-other-framework-do-you-know-and-if-there-is-anything-you-would-like-to-have-in-django-if-you-had-magical-powers">What other framework do you know and if there is anything you would like to have in Django if you had magical powers?</h4>
<p>I've been making website for more than two decades now, so I've used my fair share of various technologies and frameworks, but Django is still my "daily driver" and the one I like the best. I like writing plain CSS, and when I need some extra bit of JS I like to use Alpine JS and/or HTMX: I find they work really well together with Django.</p>
<p>If I had magical powers and could change anything, I would remove the word "patch" from existence (and especially from the Django documentation).</p>
<h4 id="s-what-projects-are-you-working-on-now">What projects are you working on now?</h4>
<p>I don't have any big projects active at the moment, I'm mostly working on client projects at work.</p>
<h4 id="s-which-django-libraries-are-your-favorite-core-or-3rd-party">Which Django libraries are your favorite (core or 3rd party)?</h4>
<p>My favorite Django library of all time is possibly <a href="https://pypi.org/project/django-admin-dracula/">django-admin-dracula</a>. It's the perfect combination of professional and whimsical for me.</p>
<p>Other than that I'm also a big fan of the <a href="https://wagtail.org/">Wagtail CMS</a>. I've been learning more and more about it in the past year and I've really been liking it. The code feels very Django-y and the community around it is lovely as well.</p>
<h4 id="s-what-are-the-top-three-things-in-django-that-you-like">What are the top three things in Django that you like?</h4>
<p>1) First of course is the people. I know it's a cliche but the community is what makes Django so special.</p>
<p>2) In terms of the framework, what brought me to it in the first place was its opinionated structure and settings. When I started working with Django I didn't really know much about web development, but Django's standard project structure and excellent defaults meant that I could just use things out of the box knowing I was building something solid. And more than that, as my skills and knowledge grew I was able to swap out those defaults with some more custom things that worked better for me. There's room to grow and the transition has always felt very smooth for me.</p>
<p>3) And if I had to pick a single feature, then I'd go for one that I think is underrated: <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/testing/tools/#django.test.TransactionTestCase.assertQuerySetEqual"><code>assertQuerySetEqual()</code></a>. I think more people should be using it!</p>
<h4 id="s-what-is-it-like-to-be-in-the-ops-team">What is it like to be in the Ops team?</h4>
<p>It's both very exciting and very boring 😅</p>
<p>Most of the tasks we do are very mundane: create DNS records, update a server, deploy a fix.
But because we have access and control over a big part of the infrastructure that powers the Django community, it's also a big responsibility which we don't take lightly.</p>
<h4 id="s-i-know-you-were-one-of-the-first-members-of-the-django-girls-foundation-board-of-directors-thats-amazing-how-did-that-start-for-you">I know you were one of the first members of the Django Girls Foundation board of directors. That's amazing! How did that start for you?</h4>
<p>By 2014 I'd become good friend with Ola &amp; Ola and in July they asked me to be a coach at the very first Django Girls workshop at EuroPython in Berlin. The energy at that event was amazing an unlike any other event I'd been a part of, so I got hooked. </p>
<p>I went on to coach at many other workshops after that. When Ola &amp; Ola had the idea to start an official entity for Django Girls, they needed a token white guy and I gladly accepted the role!</p>
<h4 id="s-you-co-created-django-under-the-hood-series-which-from-what-ive-heard-was-very-successful-at-the-time-can-you-tell-us-a-little-more-about-this-conference-and-its-beginnings">You co-created Django Under the Hood series which, from what I've heard, was very successful at the time. Can you tell us a little more about this conference and its beginnings?</h4>
<p>I'm still really proud of having been on that team and of what we achieved with this conference. So many stories to tell!</p>
<p>I believe it all started at the <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2014/mar/17/announcing-djangovillage/">Django Village conference</a> where Marc Tamlin and I were looking for ideas for how to bring the Django core team together. </p>
<p>We thought that having a conference would be a good way to give an excuse (and raise funds) for people to travel all to the same place and work on Django. Somehow we decided that Amsterdam was the perfect place for that. </p>
<p>Then we were extremely lucky that a bunch of talented folks actually turned that idea into a reality: Sasha, Ola, Tomek, Ola, Remco, Kasia (and many others) 💖.</p>
<h4 id="s-as-a-former-conference-organizer-and-volunteer-do-you-have-any-recommendations-for-those-who-want-to-contribute-or-organize-a-conference">As a former conference organizer and volunteer, do you have any recommendations for those who want to contribute or organize a conference?</h4>
<p>I think our industry (and even the world in general) is in a very different place today than a decade ago when I was actively organizing conferences. Honestly I'm not sure it would be as easy today to do the things we've done.</p>
<p>My recommendation is to do it if you can. I've forged some real friendships in my time as an organizer, and as exhausting and stressful as it can be, it's also immensely rewarding in its own way.</p>
<p>The hard lesson I'd also give is that you should pay attention to who gets to come to your events, and more importantly who doesn't. Organizing a conference is essentially making a million decisions, most of which are really boring. But every decision you make has an effect when it's combined with all the others. The food you serve or don't serve, the time of year your event takes place, its location. Whether you spend your budget on fun tshirts, or on travel grants. </p>
<p>All of it makes a difference somehow.</p>
<h4 id="s-do-you-remember-your-first-contribution-in-django">Do you remember your first contribution in Django?</h4>
<p>I do! It was commit <a href="https://github.com/django/django/commit/ac8eb82abb23f7ae50ab85100619f13257b03526">ac8eb82abb23f7ae50ab85100619f13257b03526</a>: a one character typo fix in an error message 😂</p>
<h4 id="s-is-there-anything-else-youd-like-to-say">Is there anything else you’d like to say?</h4>
<p>Open source is made of people, not code. You'll never go wrong by investing in your community. Claude will never love you back.</p>

        <div class="p-4 flex-grow overflow-hidden">
          <p class="text-base-content">
            <p>Last month <a href="https://forum.djangoproject.com/t/updating-the-code-of-conduct/43924">we announced our plan</a> to adopt <a href="https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/3/0/code_of_conduct/">Contributor Covenant 3</a> as Django's new Code of Conduct through a multi-step process. Today we're excited to share that we've completed the first step of that journey!</p>
<h4 id="s-what-weve-done">What We've Done</h4>
<p>We've merged <a href="https://github.com/django/code-of-conduct/blob/main/updates.md">new documentation</a> that outlines how any member of the Django community can propose changes to our Code of Conduct and related policies. This creates a transparent, community-driven process for keeping our policies current and relevant.</p>
<p>The new process includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Proposing Changes</strong>: Anyone can <a href="https://github.com/django/code-of-conduct/issues/new?template=coc-change-proposal.md">open an issue</a> with a clear description of their proposed change and the rationale behind it.</li>
<li><strong>Community Review</strong>: The Code of Conduct Working Group will discuss proposals in our monthly meetings and may solicit broader community feedback through the forum, Discord, or DSF Slack.</li>
<li><strong>Approval and Announcement</strong>: Once consensus is reached, changes are merged and announced to the community. Changes to the Code of Conduct itself will be sent to the DSF Board for final approval.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="s-how-you-can-get-involved">How You Can Get Involved</h4>
<p>We welcome and encourage participation from everyone in the Django community! Here's how you can engage with this process:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Share Your Ideas</strong>: If you have suggestions for improving our Code of Conduct or related documentation, <a href="https://github.com/django/code-of-conduct/issues/new?template=coc-change-proposal.md">open an issue</a> on our GitHub repo.</li>
<li><strong>Join the Discussion</strong>: Participate in community discussions about proposed changes on the forum, Discord, or DSF Slack. Keep it positive, constructive, and respectful.</li>
<li><strong>Stay Informed</strong>: Watch the <a href="https://github.com/django/code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct repository</a> to follow along with proposed changes and discussions.</li>
<li><strong>Provide Feedback</strong>: Not comfortable with GitHub? You can also reach out via <a href="mailto:conduct@djangoproject.com">conduct@djangoproject.com</a>, or look for anyone with the <code>Code of Conduct WG</code> role on Discord.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="s-whats-next">What's Next</h4>
<p>We're moving forward with the remaining steps of our plan:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Step 2</strong> (target: March 15): Update our <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/conduct/enforcement-manual/">Enforcement Manual</a>, <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/conduct/reporting/">Reporting Guidelines</a>, and <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/conduct/faq/">FAQs</a> via <a href="https://github.com/django/code-of-conduct/pull/91">pull request 91</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Step 3</strong> (target: April 15): Adopt the Contributor Covenant 3 with proposed changes from the working group.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each step will have its own pull request where the community can review and provide feedback before we merge. We're committed to taking the time needed to incorporate your input thoughtfully.</p>
<p>Thank you for being part of this important work to make Django a more welcoming and inclusive community for everyone!</p>

            <p>This is also known as: "<code>ifconfig</code> is not installed by default
anymore, how do I do this only with the <code>ip</code> command?"</p>

<p>I have been slowly training my brain to use the new commands but I
sometimes forget some. So, here's a couple of equivalence from the old
package to <code>net-tools</code> the new <code>iproute2</code>, about 10 years late:</p>

<table class="table">
<thead>

</tr>
<tr>

<td> <code>ip route del ROUTE</code>                         </td>
<td> <code>ip r d ROUTE</code>               </td>
<td> remove <code>ROUTE</code> (e.g. <code>default</code>)         </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> <code>netstat -anpe</code>             </td>

</tbody>
</table>


<p>Note that I wrote a <a href="https://anarc.at/blog/2023-03-10-listening-processes/">whole
article</a> about the latter.</p>

<h1 id="another-trick">Another trick</h1>

<p>Also note that I often alias <code>ip</code> to <code>ip -br -c</code> as it provides a
much prettier output.</p>

<p>Compare, before:</p>

<pre><code>anarcat@angela:~&gt; ip a
1: lo: &lt;LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
    inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 ::1/128 scope host noprefixroute 
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
2: wlan0: &lt;NO-CARRIER,BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state DOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/ether xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff permaddr xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx
    altname wlp166s0
    altname wlx8cf8c57333c7
4: virbr0: &lt;NO-CARRIER,BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state DOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/ether xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 192.168.122.1/24 brd 192.168.122.255 scope global virbr0
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
20: eth0: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP group default qlen 1000
    link/ether xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 192.168.0.108/24 brd 192.168.0.255 scope global dynamic noprefixroute eth0
       valid_lft 40699sec preferred_lft 40699sec
</code></pre>

<p>After:</p>

<pre><code>anarcat@angela:~&gt; ip -br -c a
lo               UNKNOWN        127.0.0.1/8 ::1/128 
wlan0            DOWN           
virbr0           DOWN           192.168.122.1/24 
eth0             UP             192.168.0.108/24 
</code></pre>

<p>I don't even need to redact MAC addresses! It also affects the display
of the other commands, which look similarly neat.</p>

<p>Also imagine pretty colors above.</p>

<p>Finally, I don't have a cheat sheet for <code>iw</code> vs <code>iwconfig</code> (from
<code>wireless-tools</code>) yet. I just use NetworkManager now and rarely have
to mess with wireless interfaces directly.</p>

<h1 id="background-and-history">Background and history</h1>

<p>For context, there are traditionally two ways of configuring the
network in Linux:</p>

<ul>
<li>the old way, with commands like <code>ifconfig</code>, <code>arp</code>, <code>route</code> and
<code>netstat</code>, those are part of the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/net-tools/">net-tools</a> package</li>
<li>the new way, mostly (but not entirely!) wrapped in a single <code>ip</code>
command, that is the <a href="https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/networking/iproute2">iproute2</a> package</li>
</ul>


<p>It seems like the latter was made "important" in Debian <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=487533">in 2008</a>,
which means every release since Debian 5 "lenny" <img alt="(!)" src="https://anarc.at/smileys/idea.png" /> has featured the
<code>ip</code> command.</p>

<p>The former <code>net-tools</code> package was <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2016/12/msg00775.html">demoted in December 2016</a> which
means every release since Debian 9 "stretch" ships <em>without</em> an
<code>ifconfig</code> command unless explicitly requested. Note that this was
mentioned <a href="https://www.debian.org/releases/stretch/amd64/release-notes">in the release notes</a> in a similar (but, IMHO, less
useful) table.</p>

<p>(Technically, the <code>net-tools</code> Debian package source still indicates it
is <code>Priority: important</code> but that's <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1128342">a bug I have just filed</a>.)</p>

<p>Finally, and perhaps more importantly, the name <code>iproute</code> is hilarious
if you are a bilingual french speaker: it can be read as "I proute"
which can be interpreted as "I fart" as "prout!" is the sound a fart
makes. The fact that it's called <code>iproute2</code> makes it only more
hilarious.</p>

         "><p>Thanks to the work of the Security Developer-in-Residence 
Seth Larson, the Python Security Response Team (PSRT) now has an 
approved <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0811/" rel="nofollow">public governance document</a> (PEP 811). Following the new governance structure the PSRT now <a href="https://devguide.python.org/developer-workflow/psrt/#members" rel="nofollow">publishes a public list of members</a>, has documented <a href="https://devguide.python.org/developer-workflow/psrt/#responsibilities-of-psrt-members" rel="nofollow">responsibilities for members</a> and <a href="https://devguide.python.org/developer-workflow/psrt/#responsibilities-of-psrt-admins" rel="nofollow">admins</a>, and a defined process for <a href="https://devguide.python.org/developer-workflow/psrt/#how-can-i-join-the-psrt" rel="nofollow">onboarding and offboarding members</a> to balance the needs of security and sustainability. The document also clarifies the relationship between the <a href="https://github.com/python/steering-council">Python Steering Council</a> and the PSRT.</p>
<p>And this new onboarding process is already working! The PSF 
Infrastructure Engineer, Jacob Coffee, has just joined the PSRT as the 
first new non-"Release Manager" member since Seth joined the PSRT in 
2023. We expect new members to join further bolstering the 
sustainability of security work for the Python programming language.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://alpha-omega.dev" rel="nofollow">Alpha-Omega</a>
 for their support of Python ecosystem security by sponsoring Seth’s 
work as the Security Developer-in-Residence at the Python Software 
Foundation.</p>
<div class="markdown-heading"><h3 class="heading-element"><strong>What is the Python Security Response Team?</strong></h3><a class="anchor" href="https://gist.github.com/#what-is-the-python-security-response-team" id="user-content-what-is-the-python-security-response-team"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a></div>
<p>Security doesn't happen by accident: it's thanks to the work of 
volunteers and paid Python Software Foundation staff on the Python 
Security Response Team to triage and coordinate vulnerability reports 
and remediations keeping all Python users safe. Just last year the PSRT 
published 16 vulnerability advisories for CPython and pip, <em>the most in a single year to date!</em></p>
<p>And the PSRT usually can’t do this work alone, PSRT coordinators are 
encouraged to involve maintainers and experts on the projects and 
submodules. By involving the experts directly in the remediation process
 ensures fixes adhere to existing API conventions and threat-models, are
 maintainable long-term, and have minimal impact on existing use-cases.</p>
<p>Sometimes the PSRT even coordinates with other open source projects 
to avoid catching the Python ecosystem off-guard by publishing a 
vulnerability advisory that affects multiple other projects. The most 
recent example of this is PyPI’s <a href="https://blog.pypi.org/posts/2025-08-07-wheel-archive-confusion-attacks/" rel="nofollow">ZIP archive differential attack mitigation</a>.</p>
<p>This work deserves <a href="https://devguide.python.org/developer-workflow/psrt/#members" rel="nofollow">recognition and celebration</a>
 just like contributions to source code and documentation. Seth and 
Jacob are developing further improvements to workflows involving “GitHub
 Security Advisories” to record the reporter, coordinator, and 
remediation developers and reviewers to CVE and OSV records to properly 
thank everyone involved in the otherwise private contribution to open 
source projects.</p>
<div class="markdown-heading"><h3 class="heading-element"><strong>How can I join the Python Security Response Team?</strong></h3><a class="anchor" href="https://gist.github.com/#how-can-i-join-the-python-security-response-team" id="user-content-how-can-i-join-the-python-security-response-team"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a></div>
<p>Maybe you’ve read all this and are interested in directly helping the
 Python programming language be more secure! The process is <a href="https://devguide.python.org/developer-workflow/psrt/#how-can-i-join-the-psrt" rel="nofollow">similar to the Core Team nomination process</a>,
 you need an existing PSRT member to nominate you and for your 
nomination to receive at least ⅔ positive votes from existing PSRT 
members.</p>
<p>You do not need to be a core developer, team member, or triager to be
 a member of the Python Security Response Team. Anyone with security 
expertise that is known and highly-trusted within the Python community 
and has time to volunteer or donate through their employer would make a 
good candidate for the PSRT. Please note that all PSRT team members <a href="https://devguide.python.org/developer-workflow/psrt/#responsibilities-of-psrt-members" rel="nofollow">have documented responsibilities</a> and are expected to contribute meaningfully to the remediation of vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Being a member of the PSRT is not required <a href="https://mail.python.org/archives/list/security-announce@python.org/" rel="nofollow">to be notified of vulnerabilities</a>
 and shouldn’t be to receive “early notification” of vulnerabilities 
affecting CPython and pip. The Python Software Foundation is a <a href="https://www.python.org/cve-numbering-authority/" rel="nofollow">CVE Numbering Authority</a> and publishes CVE and <a href="https://github.com/psf/advisory-database/">OSV</a> records with up-to-date information about vulnerabilities affecting CPython and pip.</p>

            Writing a static site generator is a developer rite of passage. For the past 13 years, this blog was generated using Nikola. This week, I finished implementing my own generator, the unoriginally named YetAnotherBlogGenerator.
Why would I do that? Why would I use C# for it? And how fast is it? Continue reading to find out.

          <p class="text-base-content">
            <p>In the Tor Project system Administrator's team (colloquially known as
TPA), we've recently changed how we take decisions, which means you'll
get clearer communications from us about upcoming changes or
<em>targeted</em> questions about a proposal.</p>

<p>Note that this change only affects the TPA team. At Tor, each team has
its own way of coordinating and making decisions, and so far this
process is only used inside TPA. We encourage other teams inside and
outside Tor to evaluate this process to see if it can improve your
processes and documentation.</p>

<h1 id="the-new-process">The new process</h1>

<p>We had traditionally been using a "RFC" ("Request For Comments")
process and have recently switched to "ADR" ("Architecture Decision
Record").</p>

<p>The ADR process is, for us, pretty simple. It consists of three
things:</p>

<ol>
<li>a simpler template</li>
<li>a simpler process</li>
<li>communication guidelines separate from the decision record</li>
</ol>


<h2 id="the-template">The template</h2>

<p>As team lead, the first thing I did was to propose a new template (in
<a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/tpa/team/-/wikis/policy/0100-adr-template">ADR-100</a>), a variation of the <a href="https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture-decision-record/blob/main/locales/en/templates/decision-record-template-by-michael-nygard/index.md">Nygard template</a>. The <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/tpa/team/-/wikis/policy/template">TPA
variation of the template</a> is similarly simple, as it has only 5
headings, and is worth quoting in full:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Context</strong>: What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating
this decision or change?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Decision</strong>: What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Consequences</strong>: What becomes easier or more difficult to do
because of this change?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>More Information</strong> (optional): What else should we know? For
larger projects, consider including a timeline and cost estimate,
along with the impact on affected users (perhaps including existing
Personas). Generally, this includes a short evaluation of
alternatives considered.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Metadata</strong>: status, decision date, decision makers, consulted,
informed users, and link to a discussion forum</p></li>
</ul>


<p>The <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/tpa/wiki-replica/-/blob/d52de1828d3ee406996345704d12663dd30f5513/policy/template.md">previous RFC template</a> had <strong>17</strong> (seventeen!) headings, which
encouraged much longer documents. Now, the decision record will be
easier to read and digest at one glance.</p>

<p>An immediate effect of this is that I've started using GitLab issues
more for comparisons and brainstorming. Instead of dumping in a
document all sorts of details like pricing or in-depth alternatives
comparison, we record those in the discussion issue, keeping the
document shorter.</p>

<h2 id="the-process">The process</h2>

<p>The whole process is simple enough that it's worth quoting in full as
well:</p>

<blockquote><p>Major decisions are introduced to stakeholders in a meeting, smaller
ones by email. A delay allows people to submit final comments before
adoption.</p></blockquote>

<p>Now, of course, the devil is in the details (and <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/tpa/team/-/wikis/policy/0101-adr-process">ADR-101</a>), but the
point is to keep things simple.</p>

<p>A crucial aspect of the proposal, which Jacob Kaplan-Moss calls the
<a href="https://jacobian.org/2023/dec/5/how-to-decide/">one weird trick</a>, is to "decide who decides". Our previous process
was vague about who makes the decision and the new template (and
process) clarifies decision makers, for each decision.</p>

<p>Inversely, some decisions degenerate into endless discussions around
trivial issues because <em>too many</em> stakeholders are consulted, a
problem known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bike_shedding">Law of triviality</a>, also known as the "Bike
Shed syndrome".</p>

<p>The new process better identifies stakeholders:</p>

<ul>
<li>"informed" users (previously "affected users")</li>
<li>"consulted" (previously undefined!)</li>
<li>"decision maker" (instead of the vague "approval")</li>
</ul>


<p>Picking those stakeholders is still tricky, but our definitions are
more explicit and aligned to the classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsibility_assignment_matrix">RACI matrix</a> (Responsible,
Accountable, Consulted, Informed).</p>

<h2 id="communication-guidelines">Communication guidelines</h2>

<p>Finally, a crucial part of the process (<a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/tpa/team/-/wikis/policy/0102-adr-communications">ADR-102</a>) is to decouple
the act of making and recording decisions from <em>communicating</em> about
the decision. Those are two <em>radically</em> different problems to
solve. We have found that a single document can't serve both purposes.</p>

<p>Because ADRs can affect a wide range of things, we don't have a
specific template for communications. We suggest the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Ws">Five Ws</a>
method (Who? What?  When? Where? Why?) and, again, to keep things simple.</p>

<h1 id="how-we-got-there">How we got there</h1>

<p>The <a href="https://adr.github.io/">ADR process</a> is not something I invented. I first stumbled upon
it in the <a href="https://github.com/thunderbird/thunderbird-android/blob/be2af5c6a0bce08385fc3f654c1185ccf9db3859/docs/architecture/adr/README.md">Thunderbird Android project</a>. Then, in parallel, I was in
the <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/tpa/team/-/issues/41428">process of reviewing the RFC process</a>, following Jacob
Kaplan-Moss's <a href="https://jacobian.org/2023/dec/1/against-rfcs/">criticism of the RFC process</a>. Essentially, he argues
that:</p>

<ol>
<li>the RFC process "doesn't include any sort of decision-making framework"</li>
<li>"RFC processes tend to lead to endless discussion"</li>
<li>the process "rewards people who can write to exhaustion"</li>
<li>"these processes are insensitive to expertise", "power dynamics and
power structures"</li>
</ol>


<p>And, indeed, I have been guilty of a lot of those issues. A verbose
writer, I have written <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/tpa/team/-/wikis/policy/tpa-rfc-33-monitoring">extremely long proposals</a> that I suspect no
one has ever fully read. Some proposals were adopted by exhaustion, or
ignored because not looping in the right stakeholders.</p>

<p>Our <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/tpa/team/-/issues/41428">discussion issue</a> on the topic has more details on the issues I
found with our RFC process. But to give credit to the old process, it
did serve us well while it was there: it's better than nothing, and it
allowed us to document a staggering number of changes and decisions
(<a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/tpa/team/-/wikis/policy">95 RFCs</a>!) made over the course of 6 years of work.</p>

<h1 id="whats-next">What's next?</h1>

<p>We're still experimenting with the communication around decisions, as
this text might suggest. Because it's a separate step, we also have a
tendency to forget or postpone it, like this post, which comes a
couple of months late.</p>

<p>Previously, we'd just ship a copy of the RFC to everyone, which was
easy and quick, but incomprehensible to most. Now we need to write a
separate communication, which is more work but, hopefully, worth the
as the result is more digestible.</p>

<p>We can't wait to hear what you think of the new process and how it
works for you, here or in the <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/tpa/team/-/issues/41428">discussion issue</a>! We're particularly
interested in people that are already using a similar process, or that
will adopt one after reading this.</p>
