<p><a href="https://github.com/kushaldas/pastewindow.nvim">pastewindow</a> is a neovim plugin
written in Lua to help to paste text from a buffer to a different window in
Neovim. This is my first attempt of writing a plugin. </p>
<p>We can select a window (in the GIF below I am using a bash terminal as target)
and send any text to that window. This will be helpful in my teaching sessions.
Specially modifying larger Python functions etc.</p>
<p><img alt="demo" src="https://kushaldas.in/images/pastewindow1.gif" /></p>
<p>I am yet to go through all the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQn2hJeHQbM&amp;list=PLep05UYkc6wTyBe7kPjQFWVXTlhKeQejM">Advent of Neovim
videos</a>
from TJ DeVries. I am hoping to improve (and more features) to the plugin after
I learn about plugin development from the videos.</p>

            In this episode, when worked on the newly migrated JourneyInbox site and focused on the database. Since me moved from Postgres to SQLite, I needed to make sure that SQLite was ready for users. We examined common configuration to optimize the database and applied that config to JourneyInbox.

            <p><em>Last year I decided that I want to share my most important learnings
about engineering, teams and quite frankly personal mental health. My hope
is that those who want to learn from me find it useful. This is a
continuation to this.</em></p>
<p>Over the years, I've been asked countless times: “What advice would you
give to young programmers or engineers?”  For the longest time, I
struggled to answer.  I wasn't sure I had anything definitive or profound
to offer.  And truthfully, even now, I'm not convinced I have enough
answers.  But as I've reflected on my journey to here, I've formulated
some ideas that I believe are worth sharing —&nbsp;if only to provide a bit of
guidance to those just starting out.  For better or worse, I think those
things are applicable regardless of profession.</p>
<p>My core belief is that fulfillment and happiness comes from deliberate
commitment to meaningful work, relationships, and personal growth and
purpose.  I don't claim that these things can be replicated, but they
worked for me and some others, so maybe they can be of use for you.</p>
<div class="section" id="put-time-in">
<h2>Put Time In</h2>
<p>Putting time into work and skills — and by that truly investing oneself —
is always worth it.</p>
<p>Whether it's working on a project, solving a difficult problem, or even
refining soft skills like communication, the act of showing up and putting
in the hours is essential.  Practice makes perfect, but more so it's all
about progress rather than perfection.  Each hour you spend iterating,
refining, failing and retrying brings you closer to excellence.  It
doesn't always feel that way in the moment but when you look back at what
you did before, you will see your progress.  And that act of looking back,
and seeing how you improved, is immensely rewarding and in turn makes you
enjoy your work.</p>
<p>I did not start out enjoying programming, not at all.  I had a friend in
school who was just better than me at everything.  It felt demotivating.
Programming turned out to be a necessary tool that I had to build things
and to share with others, and through that, I eventually ended up enjoying
it.</p>
<p>There is a narrative that working hard is inherently bad for your health
or that long hours lead to burnout.  I disagree.  It's not about how many
hours you put in, but about the enjoyment and quality of the work you're
doing.  Still some of my most favorite memories were some all-nighters I
did when I was younger working on something.  It wasn't even necessarily
on projects that ended up meaningful or successful, but it was the act in
itself.  When you find joy in what you're building in the moment, work
does not feel like a burden.  Instead it feels exciting and exhilarating.
These memories, that some might describe as unhealthy are some of my most
pleasant ones.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="work-and-the-man">
<h2>Work And The Man</h2>
<p>The key isn't avoiding hard work but finding meaning in it.  Practice and
effort, when coupled with a sense of purpose, not only make you better at
what you do but also make the journey itself fulfilling.  There is one
catch however, and that is that your payout should not just be your
happiness in the moment, but it should be long lasting.</p>
<p>The best way to completely destroy your long term satisfaction is if the
effort you are putting into something is not reciprocated or the nature
of the work feels meaningless.  It's an obvious privilege to recommend
that one shall not work for exploitative employers but you owe yourself to
get this right.  With time you build trust in yourself, and the best way
to put this trust to use, is to break out of exploitative relationships.</p>
<p>If you end up doing things you do not believe in, it will get to you.  It
will not just demotivate you and make you unhappy at work, it will
eventually make every hour you spent miserable and eventually get to your
health.</p>
<p>Other than sleeping, work is what you spent the most time with for a
significant portion of your life.  If that is not fulfilling a core pillar
of what can provide happiness is not supporting you.  I have seen people
advocate for just not caring to fix the work aspect, instead to work less
and spend more free time.  I have not found that to work for me.  Work
needs to be fulfilling, even if work is just a few hours a day.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="dare-to-commit">
<h2>Dare To Commit</h2>
<p>Life isn't about sampling everything; it’s about making deliberate choices
and committing to the ones that matter.  You don't need to date twenty
people to find the right partner, nor do you need a network of hundred
acquaintances to succeed.  Similarly, you don't need to work at ten
different companies to build a meaningful career.  Those things can be
hugely beneficial, don't get me wrong, but you can do more with less too.
When you focus on taking one step at a time, choosing the best option
available to you in that moment you can accomplish great things.  Feel
free to look to others for inspiration, but <a class="reference external" href="http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2023/2/9/everybody-is-complex/">do not to compare</a> what they have versus what you don't.
Nothing good will come from that.  Everyone's journey is unique, shaped by
the opportunities they encounter and the paths they decide to follow.
Value grows not with the breadth of options explored but with the depth of
commitment to the path you've chosen.</p>
<p>Just as mastering a skill pays dividends, so does committing on your
personal or professional journey.  Even if the world around you shifts —
like the rise of AI in software engineering — your experience and
expertise aren't wasted.  Your gained experience makes it much easier for
you to adjust course and it will give you the necessary trust in yourself.
It allows to leverage what you've learned in new ways.  While it's true
that choosing from limited options might not always lead to the “best”
possible outcome, the time and effort you invest in your chosen path can
often outweigh the hypothetical gains of a different choice.  In many
cases, mastery and fulfillment come not from chasing endless possibilities
but from fully embracing the one path you're on and making it your own.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="date-to-marry">
<h2>Date to Marry</h2>
<p>To me this happened through a lucky accident but it's something I strongly
believe in.  I'm an agnostic, I don't hold strong religious beliefs but I
do believe in the purpose of and benefits of a lasting marriage.  When my
wife and I met I did not think I was in a position in my life where I had
interest, desire or necessity in a deep relationship, let alone to marry.
We did not live in the same country when we met and we had a long distance
relationship for almost a year.  That kind of relationship (particularly
when visa issues are involved) has one incredible benefit: you really have
to commit to your relationship.  It's expensive and you spend a lot of
time talking and sharing intimate thoughts.  It also forces you to make a
concious decision if the two of you believe it's worth continuing.  You
don't have the option to just “test drive” it.  It forces you to figure
out all the hard things upfront.  Career, values, ambitions, children, the
whole thing.  That's a very different experience to swiping right and see
what comes from it.</p>
<p>That one year of intensive dating changed me.  I started to recognize the
benefits of committing to something on a much deeper level.  It taught me
that vulnerability and opening yourself up can be a beautiful thing.  It
showed me that there was a whole part to myself I did not look into.  It
showed me that really committing to something, opens up a whole new world
of opportunity and it allowed us to really invest into our relationship.</p>
<p>When you commit to your partner fully you get a lot in the process.  Yes,
there are risks and while you're dating, you need to figure these things
out.  You need to know on a fundamental level that the person you're
dating is going to be the one you want to be with for a lifetime.  That's
not easy, because no human is perfect.  Yet if that is the goal, you can
poke at the parts where dragons can be.  Only in situations of stress and
challenge will you truly find out how the other person works and if that
works for you.</p>
<p>I have heard people talk about “going to IKEA” for a date.  I think that's
a brilliant idea.  Imagining a life together and struggling a bit through
conflict and resolution is exactly the right way to go about it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="having-children">
<h2>Having Children</h2>
<p>Very few things have so profoundly changed me as our first child.</p>
<p>Seeing children grow up is such a moving experience.  I enjoy being with
them in moments of achievements or sadness alike and I love when they
surprise me in the morning with their newfound wisdom or after school with
their proud achievements.  It's fun to play with them, to help them learn
new things and you can do things together you haven't done since your own
childhood.</p>
<p>I'm lucky to have kids.  I grew up in a society that has largely painted a
pretty dark picture about having children but I do not share those views.
We knew we wanted children and I'm glad we didn't wait.  You can't cheat
nature on this thing and at the present state of scientific development,
things still are much harder if you try to have children late.</p>
<p>Nothing will ever be perfect.  There were sleepless nights, there are the
sicknesses that come in autumn with daycare and school.  You need to
arrange things in different ways than you were used to.  You will hear a
lot from parents and educators about what is is like to have children but
the reality however is that I don't think it's possible to know how it
is to have kids until you do.  In a way you have to jump into the cold
water and there is no going back.</p>
<p>There are some important prerequisites though, but I think differently
about them now then I did before.  I don't think that you need a lot of
money or a stable career, but you need to have your marriage and house in
order.  The most important thing I learned about having children is that
you first and foremost need to take care of yourself.  Any stress you
experience, you will pass on to your children and it will harm them in the
process.  This is really important.  There are lots of dysfunctional
households and bad parents and you should not have children if you can't
take care of yourself.</p>
<p>Those are the important parts, but then there are superficial issues.  I
almost entirely opted out of reading parental advise books because I could
feel how they stress me out.  I found it easier to take on challenges as
they arrive naturally.  If you have a loving relationship with your spouse
you can extend that to your children and learn how to deal with challenges
calmly (or as calmly as you can).  You need to be there for each other.
Your children will not become more successful because you mastered breast
feeding on day one or if you taught them sign language before they can
talk.  They will however be significantly better off if you can jump on a
moment's notice to take care of your spouse or child when something goes
wrong.</p>
<p>Our experience is unlikely to be your experience, but there are some
things that are shared among parents.  You grow above yourself when all
the sudden become fully responsible for another human being and you can't
opt out of it.  It also invites you to reflect on yourself more and how
you came to be the person that you are.  I also don't think it makes you
any less ambitious, but it changes how you define success for yourself.
Your horizon opens up and it really makes you think more about the
totality of your family rather than yourself.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>My life isn't about perfection or constantly chasing what's next; it's
about being present and committing to the things that matter.  This is
also what I'm passing on to my children.  Whatever your journey may look
like, I hope you find joy, purpose, and the courage to commit fully to it
and that you found something useful in my writings.</p>

            If you're a Django developer, I'm sure you've heard so many people raving about FastAPI and Pydantic. But you really love Django and don't want to switch. Then you might want to give Django Ninja a serious look. Django Ninja is highly inspired by FastAPI, but is also deeply integrated into Django itself. We have Vitaliy Kucheryaviy the creator of Django Ninja on this show to tell us all about it.

            <p>Speaking of <a href="https://juripakaste.fi/provision-info/">new Swift libraries</a>, I released another one: <a href="https://github.com/juri/tui-fuzzy-finder"><code>tui-fuzzy-finder</code></a> is a terminal UI library for Swift that provides an incremental search and selection UI that imitates the core functionality of <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf">fzf</a> very closely.</p>
<p>I have a ton of scripts that wrap fzf. Some of them try to provide some kind of command line interface with options. Most of them work with pipes where I fetch data from somewhere, parse it with <a href="https://jqlang.github.io/jq/">jq</a>, feed it fzf, use the selection again as a part of a parameter for something else, etc. It's all great, except that I really don't love shell scripting.</p>
<p>With <code>tui-fuzzy-finder</code> I want to be able to write tools like that in a language I do actually enjoy a great deal. The package provides both a command line tool and a library, but the purpose of the command line tool is just to allow me to test the library, as writing automatic tests for terminal control is difficult. Competing with fzf in the general purpose CLI tool space is a non-goal.</p>
<p>I haven't implemented the preview features of fzf, nor key binding configuration. I'm not ruling either of those out, but I have not needed them yet and don't plan to work on them before a need arises.</p>

            <p>I released a new Swift library! <a href="https://github.com/juri/provision-info"><code>provision-info</code></a> is a Swift package for macOS. Its purpose is to parse and show information about provisioning profile files. There's a command line tool and Swift library. The library part might work on iOS, too, but I have not tried. It relies on Apple's Security framework so no Linux.</p>
<p>It's not actually that new, but it's been sitting in a GitHub repo without any releases or changes for nearly three years. I needed the library in a tool at work a couple of weeks ago, so I added couple of features and finally made the first releases.</p>
<p>The CLI tool allows you to print out the basic metadata fields, the entitlements, the device IDs and the certificates in a profile file. You get them in plain text or as JSON. The library exposes the same data as Swift types.</p>
<p>There's <a href="https://swiftpackageindex.com/juri/provision-info/documentation">documentation</a> for the Swift APIs at Swift Package Index's excellent documentation hosting service. The command line tool prints out help with <code>--help</code>.</p>

            <p>You can use many great tools to help you in your software development journey. One such tool is pre-commit, a framework for managing and maintaining multi-language pre-commit hooks. You use pre-commit to run one or more tools before allowing you to commit your code locally. For example, you might run the Flake8 linter or the Ruff formatter [&#8230;]</p>

<ul>
<li>DBOS Transact is a Python library providing <strong>ultra-lightweight durable execution</strong>.</li>
<li>Durable execution means your program is <strong>resilient to any failure</strong>.</li>
<li>If it is ever interrupted or crashes, all your workflows will automatically resume from the last completed step.</li>
<li>Under the hood, DBOS Transact works by storing your program's execution state (which workflows are currently executing and which steps they've completed) in a Postgres database.</li>
<li>Incredibly fast, for example <a href="https://www.dbos.dev/blog/dbos-vs-aws-step-functions-benchmark?featured_on=pythonbytes">25x faster than AWS Step Functions</a>.</li>

<ul>
<li>Aaron Pollack on Engineering at Meta blog</li>
<li>“Overall findings
<ul>
<li>88% of respondents “Always” or “Often” use Types in their Python code.</li>
<li>IDE tooling, documentation, and catching bugs are drivers for the high adoption of types in survey responses,</li>
<li>The usability of types and ability to express complex patterns still are challenges that leave some code unchecked.</li>
<li>Latency in tooling and lack of types in popular libraries are limiting the effectiveness of type checkers.</li>
<li>Inconsistency in type check implementations and poor discoverability of the documentation create friction in onboarding types into a project and seeking help when using the tools. “</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Notes

<li>Seems to be a different survey than the 2023 (current) dev survey. Diff time frame and results. July 29 - Oct 8, 2024</li>

<p>OAuth is often employed in processes requiring permissions to be granted to frontend applications and end users.
Yet, what we typically need in API systems integrations is a way to secure connections between the integration
middleware and backend systems without a need for any ongoing human interactions.</p>
<p>OAuth can be a good choice for that scenario and this article shows how it can be achieved in Python, with backend
systems using REST and HL7 FHIR.</p>
<h2 id="what-we-would-like-to-have">What we would like to have</h2>
<p>Let's say we have a typical integration scenario as in the diagram below:</p>
<p><img src="https://upcdn.io/kW15bqq/raw/root/static/blog/images/3.2-oauth/oauth-rest-hl7-api-architecture.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>External systems and applications invoke the interoperability layer (Zato) which is expected to further invoke a few
  backend systems, e.g. a REST and HL7 FHIR one so as to return a combined result of backend API invocations. It does not
  matter what technology the client systems use, i.e. whether they are REST ones or not.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The interoperability layer needs to identify itself with the backend systems before it is allowed to invoke them - they
  need to make sure that it really is Zato and that it accesses only the resources allowed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An OAuth server issues time-based access tokens, which are simple strings, like web browser session cookies, confirming that such and such
  bearer of the said token is allowed to make such and such requests. Note that the tokens have an explicit expiration time,
  e.g. they will become invalid after one hour. Also observe that Zato stores the tokens as-is, they are genuinely opaque
  strings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a client system invokes the interoperability layer, the layer will obtain a token from the OAuth server and keep it in an internal cache.
  Next, Zato will invoke the backend systems, bearing the token among other HTTP headers. Each invoked backend system will extract the token
  from the incoming request and validate it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>How the validation looks like in practices is something that Zato will not be aware of because it treats the token as an opaque string
  but, in practice, if the token is self-contained (e.g. JWT data) the system may validate it on its own, and if it is not self-contained,
  the system may invoke an introspection endpoint on the OAuth server to validate the access token from Zato.</p>
<p>Once the validation succeeds, the backend system will reply with the business data and the interoperability layer will combine
  the results for the calling application's benefit.</p>
<p>In subsequent requests, the same access token will be reused by Zato with the same flow of messages as previously. However,
  if the cached token expires, Zato will request a new one from the OAuth server - this will be transparent to the calling application -
  and the flow will resume.</p>
<p>In OAuth terminology, what is described above has specific names, the overall flow of messages between Zato and the OAuth server is
called a "Client Credential Flow" and Zato is then considered a "client" from the OAuth server's perspective.</p>
<h2 id="configuring-oauth">Configuring OAuth</h2>
<p>First, we need to create an OAuth security definition that contains the OAuth server's connection details. In this case,
the server is <a href="https://www.okta.com/">Okta</a>. Note the scopes field - it is a list of permissions ("scopes") that Zato will be able to make use of.</p>
<p>What exactly the list of scopes should look like is something to be coordinated with the people who are responsible
for the configuration of the OAuth server. If it is you personally, simply ensure that what is in the the OAuth server and in Zato is in sync.</p>

<h2 id="calling-rest">Calling REST</h2>
<p>To invoke REST services, fill out a form as below, pointing the "Security" field to the newly created OAuth definition.
This suffices for Zato to understand when and how to obtain new tokens from the underlying OAuth server.</p>

<img src="https://upcdn.io/kW15bqq/raw/root/static/blog/images/3.2-oauth/rest-form.png" /></p>
<p>Here is sample code to invoke a backend REST system - note that we merely refer to a connection by its name, without having
to think about security at all. It is Zato that knows how to get and use OAuth tokens as required.</p>

<h2 id="what-about-the-api-clients">What about the API clients?</h2>
<p>One aspect omitted above are the initial API clients - this is on purpose. How they invoke Zato, using what protocols,
with what security mechanisms, and how to build responses based on their input data, this is completely independent of how
Zato uses OAuth in its own communication with backend systems.</p>
<p>All of these aspects can and will be independent in practice,
e.g. clients will use Basic Auth rather than OAuth. Or perhaps the clients will use AMQP, Odoo, SAP, or IBM MQ, without any HTTP,
or maybe there will be no explicit API invocations and what we call "clients" will be actually CSV files in a shared
directory that your services will be scheduled to periodically pick up. Yet, once more, regardless of what makes the input data
available, the backend OAuth mechanism will work independently of it all.</p>

            <p>I recently changed jobs, and now I am an Engineering Manager for OSS at Anaconda!</p>
<p><img alt="Anaconda Logo" src="https://dan.yeaw.me/images/Anaconda_Logo.png" /></p>
<p>This is my second major career pivot, and I thought I would share why I decided to make the change. Even though being a
Submarine Officer, a Functional Safety Lead, and working on OSS are very different, they share a common thread of
leadership and deeply technical engineering. I’m excited to bring these skills into my new role.</p>
<h3>Goodbye to Ford</h3>
<p>I spent the last 11 years leading Functional Safety at Ford. It was incredibly rewarding to grow from an individual
contributor to a manager and eventually to leading a global team dedicated to ensuring Ford vehicles were safe.</p>
<p>While this role let me support Functional Safety Engineers across the company, I started to miss getting hands-on with
technical contributions since most of my time was focused on leading the team.</p>
<p>Looking back, there are a couple of things I wish had been different at Ford:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>A strong bias for external talent with executive leadership</strong></li>
<li><strong>Too much bureaucracy, especially in approval processes</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Having a good mix of new talent join an organization is so important because fresh ideas and perspectives can make a big
difference. However, in Ford’s software engineering areas, about 90% of the executive leadership roles were filled by
people from outside the company. While I wasn’t aiming for higher leadership roles, this clear preference for external
hires made it feel like developing and retaining internal talent wasn’t a priority. As you might expect, it took new
leaders a while to adapt, and there was a lot of turnover.</p>
<p>On top of that, the approval process for things like hiring and travel was overly complicated. Simple approvals could
take months with no feedback. This culture of control slowed everything down. Delegating authority—like giving managers
a budget and headcount to work with and holding them accountable—would have made things so much smoother and faster.</p>
<p>The thing I’ll miss most about Ford is the people. I loved collaborating with all the Functional Safety Engineers and
everyone else I worked with. I wish them all the best in the future!</p>
<h3>Hello Anaconda</h3>
<p>I am now an <strong>Engineering Manager for Open Source Software</strong> at <a href="https://anaconda.com">Anaconda</a>, where I lead a team of
engineers working on amazing projects like:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://beeware.org">BeeWare</a></li>
<li><a href="https://pyscript.net">PyScript</a></li>
<li><a href="https://jupyter.org">Jupyter</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/fsspec/filesystem_spec">fsspec</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/intake/intake">Intake</a></li>
</ul>
<p>...and more!</p>
<p>Over the last seven years, I’ve been contributing to open source projects, especially in Python. Getting the chance to
lead a team that does this full-time feels like a dream come true.</p>
<p>One of the things I’m most excited about with these projects is how they help make programming more accessible. BeeWare,
for example, makes it possible to create apps for mobile and desktop, and PyScript lets you write Python directly in
your web browser. Both tools are fantastic for helping anyone pick up Python, build something useful, and share it with
others. Meanwhile, Jupyter and fsspec are key tools for data science, making it easier to analyze diverse datasets and
integrate different data sources.</p>
<p>I’m thrilled to have the opportunity to strengthen the open-source communities around these projects, encourage
healthier collaboration, and create more value for Python users by connecting these tools with the broader PyData
ecosystem.</p>
