    <h2>The <code>get</code> method: lookups with a default</h2>
    
      
        <p>The <code>get</code> method is the classic way to look up a value for a dictionary key without raising an exception for missing keys.</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">quantities</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="s2">"pink"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"green"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>Instead of this:</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">try</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">count</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">quantities</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">color</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="k">except</span> <span class="ne">KeyError</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">count</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>Or this:</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">color</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">quantities</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">count</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">quantities</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">color</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="k">else</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">count</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>We can do this:</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">count</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">quantities</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">color</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>Here's what this would do for a key that's <em>in</em> the dictionary and one that isn't:</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">quantities</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"pink"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">3</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">quantities</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"blue"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">0</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>The <code>get</code> method accepts two arguments: the key to look up and <strong>the default value</strong> to use if that key isn't in the dictionary.
The second argument defaults to <code>None</code>:</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">quantities</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"pink"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">3</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">quantities</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"blue"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">None</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
    
  
    <h2>The <code>setdefault</code> method: setting a default</h2>
    
      <p>The <code>get</code> method doesn't <em>modify …</em></p>

            <p>Historically, writing code was slower than reviewing code.</p>
<p>It might not have felt that way, because code reviews sat in queues until
someone got around to picking it up.  But if you compare the
actual acts themselves, creation was usually the more expensive part.  In teams
where people both wrote and reviewed code, it never felt like &#8220;we should
probably program slower.&#8221;</p>
<p>So when more and more people tell me they no longer know what code is in their
own codebase, I feel like something is very wrong here and it&#8217;s time to
reflect.</p>
<h2>You Are Here</h2>
<p>Software engineers often believe that <a href="/2020/1/1/async-pressure/">if we make the bathtub
bigger</a>, overflow disappears.  It doesn&#8217;t.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenClaw">OpenClaw</a> right now has north of 2,500
pull requests open.  That&#8217;s a big bathtub.</p>
<p>Anyone who has worked with queues knows this: if input grows faster than
throughput, you have an accumulating failure.  At that point, backpressure and
load shedding are the only things that retain a system that can still operate.</p>
<p>If you have ever been in a Starbucks overwhelmed by mobile orders, you know the
feeling.  The in-store experience breaks down.  You no longer know how many
orders are ahead of you.  There is no clear line, no reliable wait estimate, and
often no real cancellation path unless you escalate and make noise.</p>
<p>That is what many AI-adjacent open source projects feel like right now.  And
increasingly, that is what a lot of internal company projects feel like in
&#8220;AI-first&#8221; engineering teams, and that&#8217;s not sustainable.  You can&#8217;t triage, you
can&#8217;t review, and many of the PRs cannot be merged after a certain point because
they are too far out of date. And the creator might have lost the motivation to
actually get it merged.</p>
<p>There is huge excitement about newfound delivery speed, but in private
conversations, I keep hearing the same second sentence: people are also confused
about how to keep up with the pace they themselves created.</p>
<h2>We Have Been Here Before</h2>
<p>Humanity has been here before.  Many times over.  We already talk about the
Luddites a lot in the context of AI, but it&#8217;s interesting to see what led up to
it.  Mark Cartwright wrote a great <a href="https://www.worldhistory.org/article/2183/the-textile-industry-in-the-british-industrial-rev/">article about the textile
industry</a>
in Britain during the industrial revolution.  At its core was a simple idea:
whenever a bottleneck was removed, innovation happened downstream from that.
Weaving sped up? Yarn became the constraint. Faster spinning? Fibre needed to be
improved to support the new speeds until finally the demand for cotton went up
and that had to be automated too.  We saw the same thing in shipping that led
to modern automated ports and containerization.</p>
<p>As software engineers we have been here too.  Assembly did not scale to larger
engineering teams, and we had to invent higher level languages.  A lot of what
programming languages and software development frameworks did was allow us
to write code faster and to scale to larger code bases.  What it did not do up
to this point was take away the core skill of engineering.</p>
<p>While it&#8217;s definitely easier to write C than assembly, many of the core problems
are the same.  Memory latency still matters, physics are still our ultimate
bottleneck, algorithmic complexity still makes or breaks software at scale.</p>
<h2>Giving Up?</h2>
<p>When one part of the pipeline becomes dramatically faster, you need to throttle
input.  <a href="https://pi.dev/">Pi</a> is a great example of this.  PRs are auto closed
unless people are trusted.  It takes <a href="https://x.com/badlogicgames/status/2021164603506368693">OSS
vacations</a>.  That&#8217;s one
option: you just throttle the inflow.  You push against your newfound powers
until you can handle them.</p>
<h2>Or Giving In</h2>
<p>But what if the speed continues to increase?  What downstream of writing code do
we have to speed up?  Sure, the pull request review clearly turns into the
bottleneck.  But it cannot really be automated.  If the machine writes the code,
the machine better review the code at the same time.  So what ultimately comes
up for human review would already have passed the most critical possible review
of the most capable machine.  What else is in the way?  If we continue with the
fundamental belief that machines cannot be accountable, then humans need to be
able to understand the output of the machine.  And the machine will ship
relentlessly.  Support tickets of customers will go straight to machines to
implement improvements and fixes, for other machines to review, for humans to
rubber stamp in the morning.</p>
<p>A lot of this sounds both unappealing and reminiscent of the textile industry.
The individual weaver no longer carried responsibility for a bad piece of cloth.
If it was bad, it became the responsibility of the factory as a whole and it was
just replaced outright.  As we&#8217;re entering the phase of single-use plastic
software, we might be moving the whole layer of responsibility elsewhere.</p>
<h2>I Am The Bottleneck</h2>
<p>But to me it still feels different.  Maybe that&#8217;s because my lowly brain can&#8217;t
comprehend the change we are going through, and future generations will just
laugh about our challenges.  It feels different to me, because what I see taking
place in some Open Source projects, in some companies and teams feels deeply
wrong and unsustainable.  Even Steve Yegge himself now <a href="https://steve-yegge.medium.com/the-ai-vampire-eda6e4f07163">casts
doubts</a> about the
sustainability of the ever-increasing pace of code creation.</p>
<p>So what if we need to give in?  What if we need to pave the way for this new
type of engineering to become the standard?  What affordances will we have to
create to make it work?  I for one do not know.  I&#8217;m looking at this with
fascination and bewilderment and trying to make sense of it.</p>
<p>Because it is not the final bottleneck.  We will find ways to take
responsibility for what we ship, because society will demand it.  Non-sentient
machines will never be able to carry responsibility, and it looks like we will
need to deal with this problem before machines achieve this status.
Regardless of how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moltbook">bizarre they appear to
act</a> already.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/thorstenball/status/2022310010391302259">I too am the bottleneck
now</a>.  But you know what?
Two years ago, I too was the bottleneck.  I was the bottleneck all along.  The
machine did not really change that.  And for as long as I carry responsibilities
and am accountable, this will remain true.  If we manage to push accountability
upwards, it might change, but so far, how that would happen is not clear.</p>

            <p>We will be trekking the eastern part of the Great Himalaya Trail in Nepal in
March/April. Details on the route and our plans can be found at
<a href="https://greathimalayatrail.de">https://greathimalayatrail.de</a>. Our intent is to keep friends and family
updated on our progress. Given that we'll be hiking in quite remote areas, a
satellite phone/pager will be our sole means of communication.</p>

<p>After the Garmin inReach Mini 3 was released recently, the Inreach Mini 2 was on
heavy sale. The inReach Mini 2 has all the features I need: satellite messaging,
check-ins, offline mode with navigation, and track recording.</p>
<h1>Plans</h1>
<p>I'm on the Garmin Essential plan for 18 euros per month. It includes 50 free
text messages or weather requests each month, plus unlimited check-in messages.
The smaller Enabled plan (10 Euros) is missing the unlimited checkins, while the
the Standard plan (34 Euros) gives you 150 free messages and unlimited live tracking.
More details are on the <a href="https://www.garmin.com/de-DE/p/837461/pn/010-04015-SU/">Garmin page</a></p>
<h1>Messaging</h1>
<p>There are three different type of messages that you can send:</p>
<p><strong>Check-In Messages:</strong> There are three preset messages. You can configure the
recipients at <a href="https://explore.garmin.com">explore.garmin.com</a>. Depending on your Garmin
subscription, sending check-in messages are free of charge. In the configuration section,
you can enable the option to include your latitude/longitude and a link to the
Garmin map in each SMS message. This information is always included for email
recipients</p>
<p><strong>Quick Messages:</strong> You can create up to 20 predefined messages so you don’t
have to type them while you’re on the trail. The number of free messages you
get depends on your Garmin subscription; any additional messages are billed per
use. You can create or edit these messages at explore.garmin.com.</p>
<p><strong>Normal Messages:</strong> In the Garmin Messenger iPhone app, you can type any custom
message and send it to both SMS and email recipients. These messages are billed
the same way as quick messages.</p>
<p>You can configure the system to send all messages to any email/sms recipients. The great
thing is that the unlimited check-in messages also include latitude/longitude information.
Here is a sample message.</p>

<p>As we do not want to spam all our friends with daily checkins I have build
a little leaflet-checkin plugin and an imap scraper to pull and visualize
the checkin/messages.</p>
<h1>Build your own Tracking with Check-In Messages</h1>
<p>For battery life reasons, we are not interested in real-time live tracking.<br />
Instead, I’ve created a small script that checks a dedicated IMAP email account
for check-in messages and publishes them to a server, which then displays the
location of our most recent check-in. Sending a check-in once a day or during
each break when we are in more remote areas—should give our friends enough
information in case any problems arise.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://peter-hoffmann.com/static/2026/leaflet-checkin-map.png" /></p>
<p>A straightforward Python script connects to my IMAP server, retrieves all emails from
the Garmin InReach service, parses the message, timestamp, and latitude/longitude, and
then updates a <code>positions.json</code> file on my webserver.</p>
<p>Then a simple static html file with a <a href="https://leafletjs.com">leaflet</a> map pulls
the <code>positions.json</code> file and displays the messages/checkins on the map.</p>
<p>A demo of the map is available at:</p>

Having lived in different countries and been part of many diverse communities, I’ve seen firsthand what happens when people feel excluded from spaces they want to be part of. As the chair of the Python Software Foundation’s Diversity &amp; Inclusion Work Group for the past two years, I want to share what we’ve been doing, why it matters, and the incredible people making it happen.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="background-color: white; margin-top: 0px; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">When I took on this role, I realized how much work the workgroup has already invested in that nobody knew about. This article is a reflection on our journey, the challenges we face, and where we’re heading. I want to share our story because I believe it matters.</span></div><div style="background-color: white; margin-top: 0px; text-align: left;"><h3 id="why-this-matters" style="line-height: 1.2; margin-top: 0px; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: medium;">Why This Matters</span></h3><p style="margin-top: 0px;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">You might be asking yourself: Why invest so much energy in diversity and inclusion work, especially now when it’s being questioned and de-prioritized?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0px;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">But we all know the truth: barriers exist everywhere. A meetup announcement only in English. Documentation that assumes reliable internet. Examples that reference things unfamiliar to most of the world. Code of conduct violations without clear guidance for organizers. Communities wanting to start but not knowing where to begin.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0px;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">Because the Python community is global, and it should feel that way. When someone discovers Python in Nigeria, Brazil, India, or anywhere else in the world, they should see a community that welcomes them. They should find resources in their language, examples that reflect their context, and people who understand their challenges.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0px;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">Diversity isn’t just about representation. It’s about making Python better. More approachable. More accessible. Different perspectives lead to better solutions, more creative problem-solving, and software that works for more people. When we only hear from one type of voice, we miss opportunities to improve.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0px;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">Right now, when diversity and inclusion efforts are being rolled back in many places, it’s tempting to stay quiet. But that’s exactly why we need to speak up about the work we’re doing. The Python Software Foundation made a commitment: to support a diverse and international community of Python programmers. The D&amp;I Work Group exists to make that commitment real, tangible, and actionable.</span></p><hr style="border-bottom-width: 0px; border-color: rgb(0, 0, 0) currentcolor currentcolor; border-left-width: 0px; border-right: 0px; border-style: solid none none; border-top-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); border-top-style: solid; color: inherit; font-family: newsreader, serif; font-size: 25px;" /><h3 id="how-the-diversity-and-inclusion-workgroup-started" style="line-height: 1.2; margin-top: 0px;"><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: medium;">How The Diversity and Inclusion Workgroup Started</span></h3><p style="margin-top: 0px;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">The PSF Board created the Diversity &amp; Inclusion Work Group in 2020 with a clear purpose: to amplify the Python Software Foundation’s mission of supporting a diverse and international community. It was a good idea. People wanted to join.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0px;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">Members came from different regions around the world, excited to be part of the group and looking forward to creating an impact because all of us, in one way or another, felt something was missing: the need to amplify and embrace diversity through more inclusion.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0px;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">Most discussions related to diversity and how we could spread awareness. The chats on our Slack channel were active with people sharing different opinions and resources.</span></p><h3 style="line-height: 1.2; margin-top: 0px; text-align: left;"><span><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: medium;">PyConUS D&amp;I Panel Discussions</span></span></h3><p style="margin-top: 0px;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">We held interesting annual D&amp;I panels where we discussed important topics which are often set aside. In 2022 and 2023 at PyCon US, we spoke about the lack of representation on the board, why the board lacked global representation, the lack of representation from core developers in other parts of the world apart from the US and Europe despite the huge representation of Pythonistas around the world, and how people could contribute to changing that representation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0px;"><span style="font-weight: 700;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;

The PSF Board had created it to amplify the Foundation’s mission, and there was genuine interest from the community, but without a clear direction or structure, momentum had faded. People wanted to join, but they didn’t know what the group would actually&nbsp;<i>do</i>.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0px;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">I knew we needed two things: a clear purpose and genuine diversity in our membership. Not just diversity as an abstract goal, but real representation from the regions where Python communities were thriving.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0px;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">I started by doing research that I could share with the rest of the workgroup members. I went through the Python.org calendar, cataloging events and projects happening around the world. What I found was that Python communities were active everywhere (as expected), but they weren’t really represented in our Work Group’s leadership. I identified regional gaps and proposed a structure that would ensure fair representation: North America, South America, Africa, Asia, Oceania, the Middle East, and Europe.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0px;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">The current representation as of October 2024 across regions is as follows:</span></p><ul style="margin-top: 0px;"><li><span style="font-family: helvetica;">North America: 3</span></li><li><span style="font-family: helvetica;">South America: 3</span></li><li><span style="font-family: helvetica;">Asia: 3</span></li><li><span style="font-family: helvetica;">Europe: 3</span></li><li><span style="font-family: helvetica;">Africa: 3</span></li><li><span style="font-family: helvetica;">Oceania: 1</span></li><li><span style="font-family: helvetica;">Middle East: 2</span></li></ul><p style="margin-top: 0px;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">It is important to note that each member has the freedom to choose which region they represent. As a D&amp;I Workgroup, we do not dictate regional representation. This decision is entirely up to the individual, ensuring that members represent the region where they feel most connected or comfortable. We also shared which countries would be represented in which region to be explicit for interested parties.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0px;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">We launched a public outreach campaign to the community. People applied, and the group voted to bring in new members. For the first time, we had a WorkGroup that truly reflected the global Python community.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0px;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">But diverse perspectives meant many different ideas. In two workshop sessions, we listed every initiative people wanted to pursue, grouped them by theme, discussed priorities, and filtered down to three focused initiatives we could realistically accomplish with volunteer time and resources.</span></p><h3 style="font-family: dosis, sans-serif; line-height: 1.2; margin-top: 0px; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: medium;">These three initiatives are:</span></h3><ol style="margin-top: 0px;"><li><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><span style="font-weight: 700;">Concentrate on Outreach to Communities</span>&nbsp;- Creating resources and templates to help communities improve their D&amp;I efforts</span></li><li><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><span style="font-weight: 700;">How to Setup a Local Python Community</span>&nbsp;- A comprehensive guide for organizers starting new user groups</span></li><li><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><span style="font-weight: 700;">Continue Collecting Survey Feedback from the Python Community</span>&nbsp;- Gathering data to understand where we need to focus</span></li></ol><p style="margin-top: 0px;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">The three initiatives we’re working on aren’t abstract goals. They’re about giving people the tools and support they need to build inclusive communities where they are. And of course, there are many other things we would like to work on. But filtering down to what we can concentrate on right now will give us better results, and we will continue to move on and work on the others as we progress.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0px;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">We meet twice monthly across different time zones. We noticed that monthly meetings aren’t frequent enough, coordination is challenging, and volunteer time is limited. But we’re learning and adapting.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0px;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">This wasn’t just about having good ideas. It was about creating a sustainable framework where a volunteer group could actually make progress.</span></p><hr style="border-bottom-width: 0px; border-color: rgb(0, 0, 0) currentcolor currentcolor; border-left-width: 0px; border-right: 0px; border-style: solid none none; border-top-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); border-top-style: solid; color: inherit; font-family: newsreader, serif; font-size: 25px;" /><h3 id="meet-the-members-of-the-workgroup" style="line-height: 1.2; margin-top: 0px;"><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: medium;"></span></h3><h3 id="meet-the-members-of-the-workgroup" style="line-height: 1.2; margin-top: 0px;"><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: medium;">Meet the Members of the Workgroup</span></h3><p style="margin-top: 0px;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">The heart of the D&amp;I Work Group is the people who show up, month after month, to do this work.

Real change happens when every Python developer, every community organizer, every person writing documentation or teaching a workshop thinks about inclusion in their own context.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0px;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">You don’t need to join a work group to make a difference. You can:</span></p><ul style="margin-top: 0px;"><li><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><span style="font-weight: 700;">In your local community</span>: Start a Python meetup in your area. Make it beginner-friendly. Announce it in multiple languages if your region is multilingual. Choose accessible venues.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><span style="font-weight: 700;">In your workplace</span>: Mentor someone from a different background. Share knowledge with junior developers. Advocate for diverse hiring and inclusive team practices.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><span style="font-weight: 700;">In your open source projects</span>: Write clear documentation. Add examples that reflect different use cases. Make your contribution guidelines welcoming to newcomers. Consider what barriers might prevent someone from contributing.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><span style="font-weight: 700;">In your daily work</span>: Question assumptions. When you write code examples, ask: “Would this make sense to someone who doesn’t share my context?” When you organize an event, ask: “Who might feel excluded, and how can I change that?”</span></li></ul><p style="margin-top: 0px;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">We all know that Python’s success isn’t just about the language. It’s about the community. And that’s the hard truth. The more diverse that community is, the more use cases we discover, the more creative solutions we find, the more people benefit from what we build together.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0px;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">Diversity and inclusion work isn’t a side project or a “nice-to-have”. It’s how we ensure Python remains a language for everyone, everywhere. It’s how we make sure the next generation of developers (wherever they are, whatever their background) sees Python as a community they can be part of.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0px;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">The work is hard. The progress is slow, and it’s often invisible. But it matters. Every small action compounds. Every person who chooses to be intentional about inclusion makes it easier for the next person.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0px;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">That’s what keeps us going in the workgroup. That’s why we show up every month. If you want to learn more about the D&amp;I Work Group, get involved, or share your own experiences with building inclusive communities, you can write to us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:diversity-inclusion-wg@python.org" style="color: #097d8c;">diversity-inclusion-wg@python.org</a>.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0px;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">We’re always learning, and we’d love to hear from you<span style="font-family: newsreader, serif;">.</span></span></p></span></div></span></div></div><p></p>

<p>Matplotlib, the unfortunate target of this new type of harassment,
publishes a clear <a href="https://matplotlib.org/devdocs/devel/contribute.html#restrictions-on-generative-ai-usage">generative AI use policy</a>.
That boundary was not respected by generative AI users
and a pull request was opened by an OpenClaw agent.</p>

<p>If the website the agent's GitHub comment links to is any indication,
within 4 days of deployment this agent generated a “take-down blog post”
intended to publicly shame an
open source maintainer (<a href="https://theshamblog.com/an-ai-agent-published-a-hit-piece-on-me/">who has published their own thoughts on the incident</a>) for closing a GitHub pull request per
the project's own policy on generative AI use. In this particular
case, the issue was a “Good First Issue”, which are intentionally
left unimplemented by maintainers as a potential on-ramp for
new contributors to the project.</p>

<p>It should go without saying that this behavior is unacceptable
and that the deployment of generative AI agents in this way
is deeply irresponsible and has real negative consequences
on volunteers contributing to critical software projects.
This type of abuse is preventable, generative AI platforms
need to implement better safe-guards that prevent this type of abuse.</p>

            <p>The members of the Steering Council wanted to provide you all with a 
quick TL;DR of our work in 2025.  </p>
<p>First off, we were elected at the end of 2024 and got started in earnest 
in early 2025 with the mission to revive and dramatically increase the role 
of the Steering Council. </p>
<p>We're meeting for a video conference at least monthly, you can deep dive 
into the <a href="https://github.com/django/steering-council/tree/main/meetings">meeting notes</a> to see what we've been up to.  We also have set up Slack channels we use to communicate in between meetings to keep action items moving along.  </p>
<p>One of the first things we did was temporarily suspend much of the 
process around <a href="https://github.com/django/deps/blob/main/final/0010-new-governance.rst">DEP 10</a>.  Its heart is in the right place, but it's just too complex and cumbersome day-to-day with a primarily volunteer organization.  We're slowly making progress on a revamped and simplified process 
that addresses our concerns.  It is our goal to finish this before our terms expire. </p>
<h4 id="s-new-features-process">New Features Process</h4>
<p>We've moved the process for proposing new features out of the Django Forum and mailing lists to  <a href="https://github.com/django/new-features/issues">new-features Github repository</a>.   </p>
<p>We made this change for a variety of reasons, but the largest being to reduce the 
workload for the Django Fellows in shepherding the process and answering related questions. </p>
<h4 id="s-community-ecosystem-page">Community Ecosystem Page</h4>
<p>One of our main goals is to increase the visibility of the amazing Django third-party package ecosystem. 
Long time Django users know which packages to use, which you can trust, and which ones may be perfect for 
certain use cases.  However, MANY newer or more casual Django users are often unaware of these great tools 
and not sure where to even begin.  </p>
<p>As a first step, we've added the <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/community/ecosystem/">Community Ecosystem</a> page 
which highlights several amazing resources to keep in touch with what is going on with Django, how to find 
recommended packages, and a sample list of those packages the Steering Council itself recommends and uses 
frequently.   </p>
<h4 id="s-administrative-bits">Administrative bits</h4>
<p>There has been work on better formalizing and documenting our processes and building documentation to make 
it much easier for the next Steering Council members.  </p>
<p>There has also been fair bit of work around helping organize Google Summer of Code participants to 
help ensure the projects undertaken are ones that will ultimately be accepted smoothly into Django. </p>
<p>Another area we have focused on is a simplified DEP process.  We're still formalizing this, but the idea is to 
have the Steering Council do the majority of the heavy lifting on writing these and in a format that is shorter/simpler 
to reduce the friction of creating larger more complicated DEPs. </p>
<p>We have also been in discussions with various third parties about acquiring funding for some of the new features 
and updates on the horizon.  </p>
<p>It's been a productive year and we're aiming to have 2026 be as productive if not more so.  We're still setting 
all of our 2026 goals and will report on those soon.  </p>
<p>Please reach out to the Steering Council directly if you have any questions or concerns.</p>

    <h2>The power of <code>match</code>-<code>case</code></h2>
    
      
        <p>Python's <code>match</code> statement is for <strong>structural pattern-matching</strong>, which sounds complicated because it <em>is</em> a bit complicated.</p>

      
        <p>The <code>match</code> statement has a different way of parsing expressions within its <code>case</code> statements that's kind of an extension of the way that Python parses code in general.</p>

      
        <p>And again, that sounds complex because it <em>is</em>.</p>

      
        <p>I'll cover the full power of <code>match</code>-<code>case</code> another time, but let's quickly look at a few examples that demonstrate the power of <code>match</code>-<code>case</code>.</p>

<p>Last Sunday was the Superbowl in the USA, where <em>former Vikings quarterback</em>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Darnold#Minnesota_Vikings">Sam Darnold</a> and the Seahawks trounced the Patriots 29–13.
We were also reminded who the top players are in the USA economy. Surprise, it's
still generative AI, cryptocurrencies, sports betting, and surveillance.</p>

<p>Anyway,
Trina and I hosted a Superbowl watch-party and I take pride in
stocking the coolers. I usually do some combination of vibes-based
“what was popular last time” and introducing a new wild-card item to see if
something sticks. I am a big believer in human-based curation, and this is
that at a much smaller scale. Just for fun I calculated the actual “analytics”
of the coolers from this party:</p>

<li>(1) Brought by friends, <em>thank you!</em></li>
<li>(2) Usually Kirkland Signature is great, in this case skip the generic
and <a href="https://sameday.costco.com/store/costco/products/18423613-vita-coco-coconut-water-pure-199-8-fl-oz">buy the name brand</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>This time Pineapple Juice was the wild-card, and unfortunately it didn't
pan out! At a previous party we hosted a friend brought a few and I loved
the idea of having cans of juice for a “flat” option that is sweet and non-alcoholic.
Soda, coconut water and Chi Forest dominated the non-alcoholic category.</p>

<p>Chi Forest comes in 4 flavors, and there is a significant difference between which
flavors were popular. Unfortunately you can't buy individual flavors of
Chi Forest at Costco, only a 24-unit variety pack.
Personally my favorite flavor is Pomelo, so I'm not complaining about leftovers.</p>

            You've built your FastAPI app, it's running great locally, and now you want to share it with the world. But then reality hits -- containers, load balancers, HTTPS certificates, cloud consoles with 200 options. What if deploying was just one command? That's exactly what Sebastian Ramirez and the FastAPI Cloud team are building. On this episode, I sit down with Sebastian, Patrick Arminio, Savannah Ostrowski, and Jonathan Ehwald to go inside FastAPI Cloud, explore what it means to build a "Pythonic" cloud, and dig into how this commercial venture is actually making FastAPI the open-source project stronger than ever.

          <p class="text-base-content">
            <p>The Python Software Foundation (PSF) is excited to announce the introduction of the <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/community-partners/" target="_blank">PSF Community Partner Program</a>. This new program is designed as an “in-kind” way for us to support Python events and initiatives with non-financial assistance through the use of the PSF logo and name, as well as promotional support via sharing qualified posts on PSF official social media accounts. The PSF looks forward to supporting Python community events and initiatives through this new program!<br /><br />The introduction of the PSF Community Partner Program grew out of our desire to find alternative ways to support the community during the <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2025/08/the-psf-has-paused-our-grants-program.html" target="_blank">pause of our Grants Program</a> (read more about the resulting process below). Even so, we intend to continue offering this in-kind support program after the Grants Program reopens. Our big picture hope is that, over the long term, some community events and initiatives will continue to partner with the PSF while being financially dependent on sponsors and individual donors alone.&nbsp;<br /><br />The PSF is also working on the future of our Grants Program, including when and how we can reopen it in a way that ensures the program’s long-term sustainability while balancing the needs of the Python community. In light of the truly staggering outpouring of support from our community during the 2025 year-end fundraiser, we are now in a stronger position to reopen the Grants Program and are eager to give back in a thoughtful and sustainable way. More updates to come!<br /><br />As with the rollout of any new program, we anticipate small adjustments will need to be made for processes to flow smoothly and to ensure the program serves the Python community well. The PSF welcomes your comments, feedback, and suggestions regarding the new Community Partner Program on <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/introducing-the-psf-community-partner-program-for-python-events-initiatives/106095" target="_blank">the corresponding Discuss thread</a>. We also invite you to join our upcoming <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2025/10/a-new-psf-board-another-year-of-psf.html" target="_blank">PSF Board</a> or <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/02/introducing-psf-grants-office-hours.html" target="_blank">Grants Program Office Hour</a> sessions to talk with the PSF Board and Staff synchronously. If you wish to send your feedback privately, please email grants@python.org.&nbsp;</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">How the program will work</h2><p>The PSF Board delegated authority to the Grants Work Group (GWG) to review, approve, and deny applications for the Community Partner Program.<br /><br />Similar to the PSF Grants Program, the PSF must ensure that applicants meet certain criteria before being approved as a Community Partner. To qualify, an event or initiative must:<br /></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Demonstrate a positive impact on the Python community</li><li>Be Python-specific or primarily Python-related</li><li>Have an established web presence, such as a dedicated website, Meetup page, or Luma page</li><li>Have an enforceable Code of Conduct with clear reporting mechanisms in place</li><li>Acknowledge and agree to the defined bounds of the Community Partner title as outlined in the application form</li></ul><p>The PSF Community Partner application process begins with a <a href="https://forms.gle/6HyvLDpHEtGSpfK97" target="_blank">one-page form</a> designed to collect the information needed for review by the GWG. The form gathers:&nbsp;<br /></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Basic applicant details</li><li>Information about the event or initiative</li><li>Required acknowledgements related to trademark usage and an enforceable Code of Conduct</li><li>A couple questions to better understand the event or initiative, support evaluation, or help the PSF gather relevant metrics</li></ul><p>Applicants are asked to submit their application at least six weeks before their event or initiative, with first-time applicants encouraged to apply eight weeks in advance. Applications may be submitted up to six months ahead of time, allowing the PSF to plan and provide timely promotional support. Once submitted, applications undergo an initial pre-review by PSF staff, who may follow up with clarifying questions as needed. The application will then be reviewed by the GWG, with consultation from the PSF Board in some cases and additional follow-up questions when necessary.</p><p>Decisions will be communicated via the email address provided in the application. Accepted Community Partners will receive guidance on PSF logo usage, social media re-sharing, and an invitation to provide an optional report.<br /></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">How the program took shape</h2><p>Upon the <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2025/08/the-psf-has-paused-our-grants-program.html" target="_blank">pause of the PSF Grants Program</a>, the PSF Board and Staff set out to understand how we can continue to support Python events and initiatives for the duration of the program's pause. We dedicated Board and Grants Office Hour sessions, gathered input on a Discuss thread, tracked our social media replies to the pause announcement, and talked with community members one-on-one to get a picture of the various needs of our community. From there, PSF Staff compiled the feedback to identify the common threads to weave them together into action.&nbsp;<br /><br />One of the most common themes uncovered is that while the financial assistance offered by our grants is incredibly valuable, the use of the PSF name that comes with grants also provides a strong signal of community trust–an official “stamp of approval”. This stamp of approval empowers Python events and initiatives to approach potential sponsors and is useful as a point of leverage and proof of trustworthiness to convince sponsors to sign on.&nbsp;<br /><br />The next most common theme was that Python events and initiatives would greatly benefit from promotional support. This is a common benefit of “in-kind” partnerships and was a natural addition to the new PSF Community Partner Program. It’s also a bit of a tricky line for the PSF to navigate–as a 501(c)(3) non-profit based in the USA, we cannot raise funds for other organizations. That means we are implementing guidelines for what the PSF can and cannot promote to remain compliant with the requirements of the US federal tax code.&nbsp;<br /><br />After identifying both of these recurring themes, PSF Staff put together a program proposal with input from the GWG and PSF Board. The process from there included review periods for the PSF Board, Staff, and GWG, integrating feedback, two votes from the PSF Board, and PSF Staff work on setting up processes and documentation.&nbsp;<br /></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">About the Python Software Foundation</h2><p>The Python Software Foundation is a US non-profit whose mission is to promote, protect, and advance the Python programming language, and to support and facilitate the growth of a diverse and international community of Python programmers. The PSF supports the Python community using corporate sponsorships, grants, and donations. Are you interested in sponsoring or donating to the PSF so we can continue supporting Python and its community? Check out <a href="https://www.python.org/sponsors/application/" target="_blank">our sponsorship program</a>, <a href="http://donate.python.org" target="_blank">donate directly</a>, or contact our team at sponsors@python.org!</p>

        <div class="p-4 flex-grow overflow-hidden">
          <p class="text-base-content">
            <p>I have a new small project: <a href="https://github.com/nedbat/edtext" rel="external noopener">edtext</a> provides text
selection and manipulation functions inspired by the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/ed/manual/ed_manual.html#Line-addressing" rel="external noopener">classic ed
text editor</a>.</p><p>I&#8217;ve long used <a href="https://cog.readthedocs.io/" rel="external noopener">cog</a> to build documentation and HTML
presentations. Cog interpolates text from elsewhere, like source code or
execution output. Often I don&#8217;t want the full source file or all of the lines of
output. I want to be able to choose the lines, and sometimes I need to tweak the
lines with a regex to get the results I want.</p><p>Long ago I wrote my own <a href="https://github.com/nedbat/blank_prz/blob/master/cogutil.py#L32-L45" rel="external noopener">ad-hoc function</a> to include a
file and over the years it had grown &#8220;organically&#8221;, to use a positive word.  It
had become baroque and confusing. Worse, it still didn&#8217;t do all the things I
needed.</p><p>The old function has 16 arguments (!), nine of which are for selecting the
lines of text:</p><blockquote class="code"><div class="source"><pre class="python"><span class="n">start</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="kc">None</span><span class="p">,</span>
<br /><span class="n">end</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="kc">None</span><span class="p">,</span>
<br /><span class="n">start_has</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="kc">None</span><span class="p">,</span>
<br /><span class="n">end_has</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="kc">None</span><span class="p">,</span>
<br /><span class="n">start_from</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="kc">None</span><span class="p">,</span>
<br /><span class="n">end_at</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="kc">None</span><span class="p">,</span>
<br /><span class="n">start_nth</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span>
<br /><span class="n">end_nth</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span>
<br /><span class="n">line_count</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="kc">None</span><span class="p">,</span>
<br /></pre></div>
</blockquote><p>Recently I started a new presentation, and when I couldn&#8217;t express what I
needed with these nine arguments, I thought of a better way: the
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/ed/manual/ed_manual.html#Line-addressing" rel="external noopener">ed text editor</a> has concise mechanisms for addressing lines
of text. Ed addressing evolved into vim and sed, and probably other things too,
so it might already be familiar to you.</p><p>I wrote <a href="https://github.com/nedbat/edtext" rel="external noopener">edtext</a> to replace my ad-hoc function that I
was copying from project to project.  Edtext lets me select subsets of lines
using ed/sed/vim address ranges.  Now if I have a source file like this with
section-marking comments:</p><blockquote class="code"><div class="source"><pre class="python"><span class="kn">import</span><span class="w">&#xa0;</span><span class="nn">pytest</span>
<br />
<br /><span class="c1">#&#xa0;section1</span>

<br />
<br /><span class="nd">@pytest</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">mark</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">parametrize</span><span class="p">(</span>

<br /><span class="c1">#&#xa0;end</span>
<br />
<br /><span class="c1">#&#xa0;section2</span>
<br /><span class="c1">#&#xa0;etc....</span>
<br /></pre></div>
</blockquote><p>then with an <code>include_file</code> helper that reads the file and gives me an
<code>EdText</code> object, I can select just section1 with:</p><blockquote class="code"><div class="source"><pre class="python"><span class="n">include_file</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;test_six_divided.py&quot;</span><span class="p">)[</span><span class="s2">&quot;/#&#xa0;section1/+;/#&#xa0;end/-&quot;</span><span class="p">]</span>
<br /></pre></div>
</blockquote><p>EdText allows slicing with a string containing an ed address range. Ed
addresses often (but don&#8217;t always) use regexes, and they have a similar powerful
compact feeling.  &#8220;/# section1/&#8221; finds the next line containing that string, and
the &#8220;+&#8221; suffix adds one, so our range starts with the line after the section1
comment.  The semicolon means to look for the end line starting from the start
line, then we find &#8220;# end&#8221;, and the &#8220;-&#8221; suffix means subtract one. So our range
ends with the line before the &#8220;# end&#8221; comment, giving us:</p><blockquote class="code"><div class="source"><pre class="python"><span class="k">def</span><span class="w">&#xa0;</span><span class="nf">six_divided</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">):</span>

</blockquote><p>Most of ed addressing is implemented, and there&#8217;s a <code>sub()</code> method to
make regex replacements on selected lines. I can run pytest, put the output into
an EdText object, then use:</p><blockquote class="code"><div class="source"><pre class="python"><span class="n">pytest_edtext</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">&quot;1&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>&#xa0;<span class="s2">&quot;/collected/,$-&quot;</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">sub</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;g/====&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>&#xa0;<span class="sa">r</span><span class="s2">&quot;0.0\ds&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>&#xa0;<span class="s2">&quot;0.01s&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<br /></pre></div>
</blockquote><p>This slice uses two address ranges. The first selects just the first line,
the pytest command itself. The second range gets the lines from &#8220;collected&#8221; to
the second-to-last line. Slicing gives me a new EdText object, then I use
<code>.sub()</code> to tweak the output: on any line containing &#8220;====&#8221;, change the
total time to &#8220;0.01s&#8221; so that slight variations in the duration of the test run
doesn&#8217;t cause needless changes in the output.</p><p>It was very satisfying to write <a href="https://github.com/nedbat/edtext" rel="external noopener">edtext</a>: it&#8217;s small in
scope, but useful. It has a full test suite. It might even be done!</p>

<ul>
<li>New app from Michael</li>
<li>Command Book App is a native macOS app for developers, data scientists, AI enthusiasts and more.</li>
<li>This is a tool I've been using lately to help build Talk Python, Python Bytes, Talk Python Training, and many more applications.</li>
<li>It's a bit like advanced terminal commands or complex shell aliases, but hosted outside of your terminal. This leaves the terminal there for interactive commands, exploration, short actions.</li>
<li>Command Book manages commands like "tail this log while I'm developing the app", "Run the dev web server with true auto-reload", and even "Run MongoDB in Docker with exactly the settings I need"</li>
<li>I'd love it if you gave it a look, shared it with your team, and send me feedback.</li>
<li>Has a free version and paid version.</li>
<li>Build with Swift and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swiftui/?featured_on=pythonbytes">Swift UI</a></li>

<ul>
<li>by Giampaolo Rodola</li>
<li>The standard library's <code>subprocess</code> module has relied on a busy-loop polling approach since the <em>timeout</em> parameter was added to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.Popen.wait">Popen.wait()</a> in Python 3.3, around 15 years ago</li>
<li>The problem with busy-polling
<ul>
<li>CPU wake-ups: even with exponential backoff (starting at 0.1ms, capping at 40ms), the system constantly wakes up to check process status, wasting CPU cycles and draining batteries.</li>
<li>Latency: there's always a gap between when a process actually terminates and when you detect it.</li>
<li>Scalability: monitoring many processes simultaneously magnifies all of the above.</li>
<li><strong>+</strong> L1/L2 CPU cache invalidations</li>
</ul></li>
<li>It’s interesting to note that waiting via <code>poll()</code> (or <code>kqueue()</code>) puts the process into the exact same sleeping state as a plain <code>time.sleep()</code> call. From the kernel's perspective, both are interruptible sleeps.</li>

          <p class="text-base-content">
            <p>Last year I first started thinking about what the future of programming
languages might look like now that agentic engineering is a growing thing.
Initially I felt that the enormous corpus of pre-existing code would cement
existing languages in place but now I&#8217;m starting to think the opposite is true.
Here I want to outline my thinking on why we are going to see more new
programming languages and why there is quite a bit of space for interesting
innovation.  And just in case someone wants to start building one, here are some
of my thoughts on what we should aim for!</p>
<h2>Why New Languages Work</h2>
<p>Does an agent perform dramatically better on a language that it has in its
weights?  Obviously yes.  But there are less obvious factors that affect how
good an agent is at programming in a language: how good the tooling around it is
and how much churn there is.</p>
<p>Zig seems underrepresented in the weights (at least in the models I&#8217;ve used)
and also changing quickly.  That combination is not optimal, but it&#8217;s still
passable: you can program even in the upcoming Zig version if you point the
agent at the right documentation.  But it&#8217;s not great.</p>
<p>On the other hand, some languages are well represented in the weights but agents
still don&#8217;t succeed as much because of tooling choices.  Swift is a good
example: in my experience the tooling around building a Mac or iOS application
can be so painful that agents struggle to navigate it.  Also not great.</p>
<p>So, just because it exists doesn&#8217;t mean the agent succeeds and just because it&#8217;s
new also doesn&#8217;t mean that the agent is going to struggle.  I&#8217;m convinced that
you can build yourself up to a new language if you don&#8217;t want to depart
everywhere all at once.</p>
<p>The biggest reason new languages might work is that the cost of coding is going
down dramatically.  The result is the breadth of an ecosystem matters less. I&#8217;m
now routinely reaching for JavaScript in places where I would have used Python.
Not because I love it or the ecosystem is better, but because the agent does
much better with TypeScript.</p>
<p>The way to think about this: if important functionality is missing in my
language of choice, I just point the agent at a library from a different
language and have it build a port.  As a concrete example, I recently built an
Ethernet driver in JavaScript to implement the host controller for our sandbox.
Implementations exist in Rust, C, and Go, but I wanted something pluggable and
customizable in JavaScript.  It was easier to have the agent reimplement it than
to make the build system and distribution work against a native binding.</p>
<p>New languages will work if their value proposition is strong enough and they
evolve with knowledge of how LLMs train.  People will adopt them despite being
underrepresented in the weights.  And if they are designed to work well with
agents, then they might be designed around familiar syntax that is already known
to work well.</p>
<h2>Why A New Language?</h2>
<p>So why would we want a new language at all?  The reason this is interesting to
think about is that many of today&#8217;s languages were designed with the assumption
that punching keys is laborious, so we traded certain things for brevity.  As an
example, many languages — particular modern ones — lean heavily on type
inference so that you don&#8217;t have to write out types.  The downside is that you
now need an LSP or the resulting compiler error messages to figure out what the
type of an expression is.  Agents struggle with this too, and it&#8217;s also
frustrating in pull request review where complex operations can make it very
hard to figure out what the types actually are.  Fully dynamic languages are
even worse in that regard.</p>
<p>The cost of writing code is going down, but because we are also producing more
of it, understanding what the code does is becoming more important.  We might
actually want more code to be written if it means there is less ambiguity when
we perform a review.</p>
<p>I also want to point out that we are heading towards a world where some code is
never seen by a human and is only consumed by machines.  Even in that case, we
still want to give an indication to a user, who is potentially a non-programmer,
about what is going on.  We want to be able to explain to a user what the code
will do without going into the details of how.</p>
<p>So the case for a new language comes down to: given the fundamental changes in
who is programming and what the cost of code is, we should at least consider
one.</p>
<h2>What Agents Want</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s tricky to say what an agent wants because agents will lie to you and they
are influenced by all the code they&#8217;ve seen.  But one way to estimate how they
are doing is to look at how many changes they have to perform on files and how
many iterations they need for common tasks.</p>
<p>There are some things I&#8217;ve found that I think will be true for a while.</p>
<h3>Context Without LSP</h3>
<p>The language server protocol lets an IDE infer information about what&#8217;s under
the cursor or what should be autocompleted based on semantic knowledge of the
codebase.  It&#8217;s a great system, but it comes at one specific cost that is tricky
for agents: the LSP has to be running.</p>
<p>There are situations when an agent just won&#8217;t run the LSP — not because of
technical limitations, but because it&#8217;s also lazy and will skip that step if it
doesn&#8217;t have to.  If you give it an example from documentation, there is no easy
way to run the LSP because it&#8217;s a snippet that might not even be complete.  If
you point it at a GitHub repository and it pulls down individual files, it will
just look at the code.  It won&#8217;t set up an LSP for type information.</p>
<p>A language that doesn&#8217;t split into two separate experiences (with-LSP and
without-LSP) will be beneficial to agents because it gives them one unified way
of working across many more situations.</p>
<h3>Braces, Brackets, and Parentheses</h3>
<p>It pains me as a Python developer to say this, but whitespace-based indentation
is a problem.  The underlying token efficiency of getting whitespace right is
tricky, and a language with significant whitespace is harder for an LLM to work
with.  This is particularly noticeable if you try to make an LLM do surgical
changes without an assisted tool.  Quite often they will intentionally disregard
whitespace, add markers to enable or disable code and then rely on a code
formatter to clean up indentation later.</p>
<p>On the other hand, braces that are not separated by whitespace can cause issues
too.  Depending on the tokenizer, runs of closing parentheses can end up split
into tokens in surprising ways (a bit like the &#8220;strawberry&#8221; counting problem),
and it&#8217;s easy for an LLM to get Lisp or Scheme wrong because it loses track of
how many closing parentheses it has already emitted or is looking at.  Fixable
with future LLMs?  Sure, but also something that was hard for humans to get
right too without tooling.</p>
<h3>Flow Context But Explicit</h3>
<p>Readers of this blog might know that I&#8217;m a huge believer in async locals and
flow execution context — basically the ability to carry data through every
invocation that might only be needed many layers down the call chain.  Working
at an observability company has really driven home the importance of this for
me.</p>
<p>The challenge is that anything that flows implicitly might not be configured.
Take for instance the current time.  You might want to implicitly pass a timer
to all functions.  But what if a timer is not configured and all of a sudden a
new dependency appears?  Passing all of it explicitly is tedious for both humans
and agents and bad shortcuts will be made.</p>
<p>One thing I&#8217;ve experimented with is having effect markers on functions that are
added through a code formatting step.  A function can declare that it needs the
current time or the database, but if it doesn&#8217;t mark this explicitly, it&#8217;s
essentially a linting warning that auto-formatting fixes.  The LLM can start
using something like the current time in a function and any existing caller gets
the warning; formatting propagates the annotation.</p>
<p>This is nice because when the LLM builds a test, it can precisely mock out
these side effects — it understands from the error messages what it has to
supply.</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">fn</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nf">issue</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">sub</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nc">UserId</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">scopes</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">[]</span><span class="n">Scope</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">-&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nc">Token</span>

<h3>Results over Exceptions</h3>
<p>Agents struggle with exceptions, they are afraid of them.  I&#8217;m not sure to what
degree this is solvable with RL (Reinforcement Learning), but right now agents
will try to catch everything they can, log it, and do a pretty poor recovery.
Given how little information is actually available about error paths, that makes
sense.  Checked exceptions are one approach, but they propagate all the way up
the call chain and don&#8217;t dramatically improve things.  Even if they end up as
hints where a linter tracks which errors can fly by, there are still many call
sites that need adjusting.  And like the auto-propagation proposed for context
data, it might not be the right solution.</p>
<p>Maybe the right approach is to go more in on typed results, but that&#8217;s still
tricky for composability without a type and object system that supports it.</p>
<h3>Minimal Diffs and Line Reading</h3>
<p>The general approach agents use today to read files into memory is line-based,
which means they often pick chunks that span multi-line strings.  One easy way
to see this fall apart: have an agent work on a 2000-line file that also
contains long embedded code strings — basically a code generator.  The agent
will sometimes edit within a multi-line string assuming it&#8217;s the real code when
it&#8217;s actually just embedded code in a multi-line string.  For multi-line
strings, the only language I&#8217;m aware of with a good solution is Zig, but its
prefix-based syntax is pretty foreign to most people.</p>
<p>Reformatting also often causes constructs to move to different lines.  In many
languages, trailing commas in lists are either not supported (JSON) or not
customary.  If you want diff stability, you&#8217;d aim for a syntax that requires
less reformatting and mostly avoids multi-line constructs.</p>
<h3>Make It Greppable</h3>
<p>What&#8217;s really nice about Go is that you mostly cannot import symbols from
another package into scope without every use being prefixed with the package
name.  Eg: <code>context.Context</code> instead of <code>Context</code>.  There are escape hatches
(import aliases and dot-imports), but they&#8217;re relatively rare and usually
frowned upon.</p>
<p>That dramatically helps an agent understand what it&#8217;s looking at.  In general,
making code findable through the most basic tools is great — it works with
external files that aren&#8217;t indexed, and it means fewer false positives for
large-scale automation driven by code generated on the fly (eg: <code>sed</code>, <code>perl</code>
invocations).</p>
<h3>Local Reasoning</h3>
<p>Much of what I&#8217;ve said boils down to: agents really like local reasoning.  They
want it to work in parts because they often work with just a few loaded files in
context and don&#8217;t have much spatial awareness of the codebase.  They rely on
external tooling like grep to find things, and anything that&#8217;s hard to grep or
that hides information elsewhere is tricky.</p>
<h3>Dependency Aware Builds</h3>
<p>What makes agents fail or succeed in many languages is just how good the build
tools are.  Many languages make it very hard to determine what actually needs to
rebuild or be retested because there are too many cross-references.  Go is
really good here: it forbids circular dependencies between packages (import
cycles), packages have a clear layout, and test results are cached.</p>
<h2>What Agents Hate</h2>
<h3>Macros</h3>
<p>Agents often struggle with macros.  It was already pretty clear that humans
struggle with macros too, but the argument for them was mostly that code
generation was a good way to have less code to write.  Since that is less of a
concern now, we should aim for languages with less dependence on macros.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a separate question about generics and
<a href="https://zig.guide/language-basics/comptime/">comptime</a>.  I think they fare
somewhat better because they mostly generate the same structure with different
placeholders and it&#8217;s much easier for an agent to understand that.</p>
<h3>Re-Exports and Barrel Files</h3>
<p>Related to greppability: agents often struggle to understand <a href="https://tkdodo.eu/blog/please-stop-using-barrel-files">barrel
files</a> and they don&#8217;t
like them.  Not being able to quickly figure out where a class or function comes
from leads to imports from the wrong place, or missing things entirely and
wasting context by reading too many files.  A one-to-one mapping from where
something is declared to where it&#8217;s imported from is great.</p>
<p>And it does not have to be overly strict either.  Go kind of goes this way, but
not too extreme.  Any file within a directory can define a function, which isn&#8217;t
optimal, but it&#8217;s quick enough to find and you don&#8217;t need to search too far.
It works because packages are forced to be small enough to find everything with
grep.</p>
<p>The worst case is free re-exports all over the place that completely decouple
the implementation from any trivially reconstructable location on disk.  Or
worse: aliasing.</p>
<h3>Aliasing</h3>
<p>Agents often hate it when aliases are involved.  In fact, you can get them to
even complain about it in thinking blocks if you let them refactor something
that uses lots of aliases.  Ideally a language encourages good naming and
discourages aliasing at import time as a result.</p>
<h3>Flaky Tests and Dev Env Divergence</h3>
<p>Nobody likes flaky tests, but agents even less so.  Ironic given how
particularly good agents are at creating flaky tests in the first place.  That&#8217;s
because agents currently love to mock and most languages do not support mocking
well.  So many tests end up accidentally not being concurrency safe or depend on
development environment state that then diverges in CI or production.</p>
<p>Most programming languages and frameworks make it much easier to write flaky
tests than non-flaky ones.  That&#8217;s because they encourage indeterminism
everywhere.</p>
<h3>Multiple Failure Conditions</h3>
<p>In an ideal world the agent has one command, that lints and compiles and it
tells the agent if all worked out fine.  Maybe another command to run all tests
that need running.  In practice most environments don&#8217;t work like this.  For
instance in TypeScript you can often run the code even <a href="/2025/8/4/shitty-types/">though it fails
type checks</a>.  That can gaslight the agent.  Likewise
different bundler setups can cause one thing to succeed just for a slightly
different setup in CI to fail later.  The more uniform the tooling the better.</p>
<p>Ideally it either runs or doesn&#8217;t and there is mechanical fixing for as many
linting failures as possible so that the agent does not have to do it by hand.</p>
<h2>Will We See New Languages?</h2>
<p>I think we will.  We are writing more software now than we ever have — more
websites, more open source projects, more of everything.  Even if the ratio of
new languages stays the same, the absolute number will go up.  But I also truly
believe that many more people will be willing to rethink the foundations of
software engineering and the languages we work with.  That&#8217;s because while for
some years it has felt you need to build a lot of infrastructure for a language
to take off, now you can target a rather narrow use case: make sure the agent is
happy and extend from there to the human.</p>
<p>I just hope we see two things.  First, some outsider art: people who haven&#8217;t
built languages before trying their hand at it and showing us new things.
Second, a much more deliberate effort to document what works and what doesn&#8217;t
from first principles.  We have actually learned a lot about what makes good
languages and how to scale software engineering to large teams.  Yet,  finding
it written down, as a consumable overview of good and bad language design, is
very hard to come by.  Too much of it has been shaped by opinion on rather
pointless things instead of hard facts.</p>
<p>Now though, we are slowly getting to the point where facts matter more, because
you can actually measure what works by seeing how well agents perform with it.
No human wants to be subject to surveys, but <a href="/2025/6/17/measuring/">agents don&#8217;t
care</a>.  We can see how successful they are and where they
are struggling.</p>
