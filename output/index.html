        <!-- Content Section -->
        <div class="p-4 flex-grow overflow-hidden">
          <p class="text-base-content">
            <p>In January 2025, the PSF submitted a proposal to the US government National Science Foundation under the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/safe-ose-safety-security-privacy-open-source-ecosystems" target="_blank">Safety, Security, and Privacy of Open Source Ecosystems program</a> to address structural vulnerabilities in Python and PyPI. It was the PSF’s first time applying for government funding, and navigating the intensive process was a steep learning curve for our small team to climb. Seth Larson, PSF Security Developer in Residence, serving as Principal Investigator (PI) with Loren Crary, PSF Deputy Executive Director, as co-PI, led the multi-round proposal writing process as well as the months-long vetting process. We invested our time and effort because we felt the PSF’s work is a strong fit for the program and that the benefit to the community if our proposal were accepted was considerable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div><div>We were honored when, after many months of work, our proposal was recommended for funding, particularly as only <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/overview" target="_blank">36% </a>of new NSF grant applicants are successful on their first attempt. We became concerned, however, when we were presented with the terms and conditions we would be required to agree to if we accepted the grant. These terms included affirming the statement that we “do not, and will not during the term of this financial assistance award, operate any programs that advance or promote DEI, or discriminatory equity ideology in violation of Federal anti-discrimination laws.” This restriction would apply not only to the security work directly funded by the grant, <b>but to any and all activity of the PSF as a whole</b>. Further, violation of this term gave the NSF the right to “claw back” previously approved and transferred funds. This would create a situation where money we’d already spent could be taken back, which would be an enormous, open-ended financial risk.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div></div><div><br /></div><div>Diversity, equity, and inclusion are core to the PSF’s values, as committed to in our <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/mission/" target="_blank">mission statement</a>:&nbsp;</div><div><div></div></div><blockquote><div><div><i>The mission of the Python Software Foundation is to promote, protect, and advance the Python programming language, and to support and facilitate the growth of <b>a diverse and international community</b> of Python programmers.</i></div></div><div></div></blockquote><div><div>Given the value of the grant to the community and the PSF, we did our utmost to get clarity on the terms and to find a way to move forward in concert with our values. We consulted our NSF contacts and reviewed decisions made by other organizations in similar circumstances, particularly <a href="https://carpentries.org/blog/2025/06/announcing-withdrawal-of-nsf-pose-proposal/" target="_blank">The Carpentries</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div></div><div><br /></div><div><div>In the end, however, the PSF simply can’t agree to a statement that we won’t operate any programs that “advance or promote” diversity, equity, and inclusion, as it would be a betrayal of our mission and our community.&nbsp;</div></div><div><br /></div><div><div>We’re disappointed to have been put in the position where we had to make this decision, because we believe our proposed project would offer invaluable advances to the Python and greater open source community, protecting millions of PyPI users from attempted supply-chain attacks. The proposed project would create new tools for automated proactive review of all packages uploaded to PyPI, rather than the current process of reactive-only review. These novel tools would rely on capability analysis, designed based on a dataset of known malware. Beyond just protecting PyPI users, the outputs of this work could be transferable for all open source software package registries, such as NPM and Crates.io, improving security across multiple open source ecosystems.</div></div><div><br /></div><div><div>In addition to the security benefits, the grant funds would have made a big difference to the PSF’s budget. The PSF is a relatively small organization, operating with an annual budget of around $5 million per year, with a staff of just 14. $1.5 million over two years would have been quite a lot of money for us, and easily the largest grant we’d ever received. Ultimately, however, the value of the work and the size of the grant were not more important than practicing our values and retaining the freedom to support every part of our community. The PSF Board voted unanimously to withdraw our application.&nbsp;</div></div><div><br /></div><div><div>Giving up the NSF grant opportunity—along with inflation, lower sponsorship, economic pressure in the tech sector, and global/local uncertainty and conflict—means the PSF needs financial support now more than ever. We are incredibly grateful for any help you can offer. If you're already a PSF member or regular donor, you have our deep appreciation, and we urge you to share your story about why you support the PSF. Your stories make all the difference in spreading awareness about the mission and work of the PSF.&nbsp;</div></div><div><br /></div><div><div>How to support the PSF:</div></div><div><ul style="text-align: left;"><li><a href="https://psfmember.org/civicrm/contribute/transact/?reset=1&amp;id=1">Become a Member</a>: When you sign up as a Supporting Member of the PSF, you become a part of the PSF.

            <p>Back in July, we celebrated a very special occasion: <a href="/weblog/2025/jul/13/happy-20th-birthday-django/">Django’s 20th birthday</a> 🎉 To mark the occasion, three amateur radio operators (including myself) spent the next 14 days, operating evenings and weekends, broadcasting a special event call sign: W2D.</p>
<p><strong>Over those two weeks, we completed 1,026 radio contacts with radio operators in 47 geopolitical entities</strong> (for example, the continental US, Alaska and Hawaii are considered separate entities). The US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) issues special event "call signs" for these types of events. We selected W2D for 20 years of Django, but the reference to "Web 2.0" during Django's early years was a bonus!</p>
<p>Over 7,000 lookups were counted on a main callsign lookup site as radio operators checked into what W2D was about. <a href="https://hamradioprep.com/what-is-ham-radio/">Ham radio</a> is a very popular activity, with more than 750,000 licensed hams in the US!</p>
<p>We created a custom certificate inspired by the design of the Django admin interface for those who made contact with us (certificates are common / expected for events like this in the radio hobby). Here is a sample one, other amateurs contacting the event were able to generate/download their own Django admin inspired certificate from a Django site (which does repeat for those who contacted us multiple times):</p>
<p><img alt="A sample of the commemorative certificate, inspired by Django’s admin. Operators who made contact can generate and download their own personalized version." src="https://media.djangoproject.com/blog/images/2025/10/W2D_Certificate_W2D_AF0G-75.webp" /></p>
<p>Thank you to the amateur radio operators who made the event possible and of course those who contacted us! Thanks to you this was a fun time for us all. Additionally, thank you to the Django Software Foundation and its members who make the Django Web Framework and its community possible.</p>

<p>This screenshot shows 3 other stations (ON7EQ from Belgium, PC2J from the Netherlands, and WA4NFO from the US all calling W2D on "20 meters" (14 MHz, so named because the wavelength would be 20 meters long per wave) All of the orange bubbles in the map show the other stations receiving the signal from W2D being transmitted with 30 watts of RF power. The antenna is an approximately 63 foot long piece of wire running between a balcony and a fence post.</p>

            <p>With the release of <strong>psutil 7.1.2</strong>, wheels for free-threaded Python are now
available. This milestone was achieved largely through a <strong>community effort</strong>,
as several internal refactorings to the C code were required to make it
possible (see <a href="https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil/issues/2565#issuecomment-2910225647">issue #2565</a>).

public email address listed on GitHub?</p>

<p>No problem, you can use this handy
script to automatically discover a users' display name and per-account
"noreply" email address that'll mark their account as a co-author
without a public email address.</p>

<p>I've added this script to my <code>PATH</code> in a file named <code>coauthoredby</code>, so I can call the script like so:</p>

<pre><code>$ coauthoredby sethmlarson

<p>And this can be used auto-magically with multi line git commits,
so if I'm trying to credit <a href="https://github.com/pquentin">Quentin Pradet</a> as a co-author I'd do this:</p>

<pre><code>$ git commit -m "Fixing bugs as usual

<p>Resulting in this git commit message:</p>

            This is a guest post from Dido Grigorov, a deep learning engineer and Python programmer with 17 years of experience in the field. Python’s flexibility and ease of use make it a go-to language for developers, but its interpreted nature and global interpreter lock (GIL) can lead to performance bottlenecks, especially in large-scale or resource-intensive [&#8230;]

            <p>Django 6.0 beta 1 is now available. It represents the second
stage in the 6.0 release cycle and is an opportunity to try out
the changes coming in Django 6.0.</p>
<p>Django 6.0 assembles a mosaic of modern tools and thoughtful design, which you
can read about in <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/6.0/">the in-development 6.0 release notes</a>.</p>
<p>Only bugs in new features and regressions from earlier Django versions will be
fixed between now and the 6.0 final release. Translations will
be updated following the &quot;string freeze&quot;, which occurs when the release
candidate is issued. The <a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/download/6.0/roadmap/">current release schedule</a> calls
for a release candidate in about a month, with the final release scheduled
roughly two weeks later on December 3.</p>
<p>Early and frequent testing from the community will help minimize the number of
bugs in the release. Updates on the release schedule are available <a class="reference external" href="https://forum.djangoproject.com/t/django-6-0-release-timeline-and-next-steps/41275">on the
Django forum</a>.</p>
<p>As with all alpha and beta packages, this release is <strong>not</strong> for production
use. However, if you'd like to try some of the new features or help find and
fix bugs (which should be reported to <a class="reference external" href="https://code.djangoproject.com/newticket">the issue tracker</a>), you can grab a copy of the beta
package from <a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/download/">our downloads page</a> or
on PyPI.</p>
<p>The PGP key ID used for this release is Natalia Bidart: <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/nessita.gpg">2EE82A8D9470983E</a></p>

            <p>This is a funny short story about contributing to internet standards.
The real heroes of the story are <a href="https://filippo.io/">Filippo Valsorda</a> and <a href="https://github.com/cfrg/draft-irtf-cfrg-concrete-hybrid-kems/graphs/contributors">all the other contributors</a> to post-quantum cryptography standards (PQC). Without their efforts internet communications would be less secure, so thank you :)</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>As I understand the situation, the internet standard being discussed is “<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-irtf-cfrg-concrete-hybrid-kems/">Concrete Hybrid PQ/T Key Encapsulation Mechanisms</a>” (KEMs) which combine PQ algorithms with traditional algorithms. The reasoning being that PQ algorithms are relatively new which is not <em>great</em> for cryptography which would prefer using algorithms that have survived many years of scrutiny and analysis, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EdDSA">EdDSA</a>.</p>

<p>Therefore, it is desirable to have a “hybrid” KEM designed such that the hybrid “fails gracefully” by only losing the <em>quantum safety</em> property if the PQ algorithm is insecure, but doesn't compromise safety to traditional attack vectors that exist without sufficiently powerful quantum computers. My intuition is this will allow for more confident experimentation and deployment of PQ algorithms, as the stakes are much lower for actually rolling out the new algorithms with this construction.</p>

<p>There are three concrete hybrid KEM instances that are defined within the standard, they are named but the names may change in the future:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>MLKEM768-P256</code></li>
<li><code>MLKEM768-X25519</code> (aka “X-Wing”)</li>
<li><code>MLKEM1024-P384</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Note that the <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-connolly-cfrg-xwing-kem-09.html">X-Wing KEM was first published in January 2024</a>, much earlier than the other KEMs in this draft.
You may have already guessed that the name of the "X-Wing" KEM is relevant to the title of the blog post :)</p>

<p>These hybrid KEMs are made up of 5 components:</p>

<ul>
<li>Traditional component that is either a “nominal group” or a traditional KEM</li>
<li>A post-quantum KEM</li>
<li>A pseudo-random number generator (PRG)</li>
<li>A key-derivation function (KDF)</li>
<li>And finally, a label which is a byte string that labels the specific combination of the above components.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the X-Wing KEM the label is the byte string “<code>0x5C2E2F2F5E5C</code>”, which if printed out as ASCII looks like an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-wing_fighter">X-Wing from Star Wars</a>:</p>

<pre style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><code>\./
/^\
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the newline was added to better visualize the ASCII art of an X-Wing, the newline isn't present in the actual KEM label byte string.</p>

<p>This is where my concrete understanding of the context is fuzzier, and figuring it all out would require digging through IETF mailing list exchanges.
As far as I could tell from a quick read the new KEM constructions being proposed were going to have real names instead of ASCII art to match the actual name of the construction, basically what name you'd end up configuring in OpenSSL, NGINX, etc.</p>

<p>This naming discussions was taking time and the label being used for key derivation means that implementations of this draft standard couldn't be deployed, as that label was not finalized and could change later.</p>

<p>Filippo asked on the IETF mailing list whether the label and the name could be disconnected for the new set of KEM constructions and instead follow the lead of X-Wing using small ASCII art of spaceships. This would let the naming discussion continue while allowing implementers to begin deploying their experiments without fear of having the labels change at a later time.</p>

<p>So Filippo created a few new ASCII art pieces, one of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIE_fighter">imperial TIE fighter</a> for <code>MLKEM768-P256</code> and another of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Star_Wars_spacecraft#Lambda-class_shuttle#:~:text=Imperial%20shuttle">imperial Lambda shuttle</a> for <code>MLKEM1024-P384</code>:</p>

<pre style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><code>|A|   |
|V|  /-\
</code></pre>

<p>Filippo <a href="https://abyssdomain.expert/@filippo/115384481568122932">posted about this on Mastodon</a>, where Frederik Braun <a href="https://social.security.plumbing/@freddy/115390055125695964">suggested</a> changing the TIE fighter to <code>|-o-|</code>.

<p>Frederik and Filippo approved of my rendition, and <a href="https://github.com/cfrg/draft-irtf-cfrg-concrete-hybrid-kems/pull/28">submitted a pull request</a> which was eventually merged
into the draft. I love little <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2324.html#section-2.3.2">easter-eggs</a> left in internet standards by authors
so it felt special to be able to contribute my own for future readers' enjoyment. <em>Happy implementing!</em> :)</p>

            >

        <div class="p-4 flex-grow overflow-hidden">
          <p class="text-base-content">
            <p>Plenty has been written about how hard it is to build in Europe versus the US.
The list is always the same with little process: brittle politics, dense
bureaucracy, mandatory notaries, endless and rigid
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_your_customer">KYC</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti%E2%80%93money_laundering">AML</a> processes.
Fine.  I know, you know.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not here to add another complaint to the pile (but if we meet over a beer
or coffee, I&#8217;m happy to unload a lot of hilarious anecdotes on you).  The
unfortunate reality is that most of these constraints won&#8217;t change in my
lifetime and maybe ever.  Europe is not culturally aligned with
entrepreneurship, it&#8217;s opposed to the idea of employee equity, and our laws
reflect that.</p>
<p>What bothers me isn&#8217;t the rules — it&#8217;s the posture that develops form it within
people that should know better.  Across the system, everyone points at someone
else.  If a process takes 10 steps, you&#8217;ll find 10 people who feel absolved of
responsibility because they can cite 9 other blockers.  Friction becomes a
moral license to do a mediocre job (while lamenting about it).</p>
<p>The vibe is: &#8220;Because the system is slow, I can be slow.  Because there are
rules, I don&#8217;t need judgment. Because there&#8217;s risk, I don&#8217;t need initiative.&#8221;
And then we all nod along and nothing moves.</p>
<p>There are excellent people here; I&#8217;ve worked with them.  But they are fighting
upstream against a default of low agency.  When the process is bad, too many
people collapse into it.  Communication narrows to the shortest possible
message.  Friday after 2pm, the notary won&#8217;t reply — and the notary surely will blame
labor costs or regulation for why service ends there.  The bank will cite
compliance for why they don&#8217;t need to do anything.  The registrar will point at
some law that allows them to demand a translation of a document by a court
appointed translator.  Everyone has a reason.  No one owns the outcome.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the US, our counsel replies when it matters, even after hours.
Bankers answer the same day.  The instinct is to enable progress, not enumerate
reasons you can’t have it.  The goal is the outcome and the rules are
constraints to navigate, not a shield to hide behind.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s the point?  I can&#8217;t fix politics.  What I can do: act with agency,
and surround myself with people who do the same and speak in support of it.
Work with those who start from &#8220;how do we make this work?&#8221; not &#8220;why this can&#8217;t
work.&#8221;  Name the absurdities without using them as cover.  Be transparent, move
anyway and tell people.</p>
<p>Nothing stops a notary from designing an onboarding flow that gets an Austrian
company set up in five days — standardized KYC packets, templated resolutions,
scheduled signing slots, clear checklists, async updates, a bias for same-day
feedback.  That could exist right now.  It rarely does or falls short.</p>
<p>Yes, much in Europe is objectively worse for builders.  We have to accept it.
Then squeeze everything you can from what is in your control:</p>
<ul>
<li>Own the handoff. When you&#8217;re step 3 of 10, behave like step 10 depends on you
and behave like you control all 10 steps.  Anticipate blockers further down
the line.  Move same day.  Eliminate ambiguity.  Close loops.</li>
<li>Default to clarity.  Send checklists.  Preempt the next two questions.
Reduce the number of touches.</li>
<li>Model urgency without theatrics.  Be calm, fast, and precise.  Don&#8217;t
make your customer chase you.</li>
<li>Use judgment.  Rules exist and we can&#8217;t break them all.  But we can work with
them and be guided by them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Select for agency.  Choose partners who answer promptly when it&#8217;s material and
who don&#8217;t confuse process with progress.</p>
<p>The trap is not only regulation.  It&#8217;s the learned helplessness it breeds.  If
we let friction set our standards, we become the friction.  We won&#8217;t legislate
our way to a US-style environment anytime soon.  But we don&#8217;t need permission
to be better operators inside a bad one.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the contrast and it&#8217;s the part we control.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Postscript:</strong> Comparing Europe to the US triggers people and I&#8217;m concious of
that.  Maturity is holding two truths at once: they do some things right and
some things wrong and so do we.  You don&#8217;t win by talking others down or
praying for their failure.  I&#8217;d rather see both Europe and the US succeed than
celebrate Europe failing slightly less.</p>
<p>And no, saying I feel gratitude and happiness when I get a midnight reply
doesn&#8217;t make me anti-work-life balance (<a href="/2025/9/4/996/">I am not</a>).  It means
when something is truly time-critical, fast, clear action lifts everyone.  The
times someone sent a document in minutes, late at night, both sides felt good
about it when it mattered.  Responsiveness, used with judgment, is not
exploitation; it&#8217;s respect for outcomes and the relationships we form.</p>

    <h2>String formatting: a <em>very</em> brief history</h2>
    
      
        <p>Python has had many different waves of string interpolation over the years.</p>

      
        <p>It's had percent-style (<code>%</code>) string formatting since pretty much the beginning:</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"Trey"</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">3</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="s2">"</span><span class="si">%s</span><span class="s2">, you have </span><span class="si">%d</span><span class="s2"> new messages."</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">n</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">'Trey, you have 3 new messages.'</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>Then Python 2.4 added a <code>Template</code> class to the <code>string</code> module:</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">string</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">Template</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Template</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"$name, you have $n new messages."</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">substitute</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">n</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">n</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">'Trey, you have 3 new messages.'</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>And Python 2.6 added an even easier version of string formatting with the string <code>format</code> method:</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="s2">"</span><span class="si">{name}</span><span class="s2">, you have </span><span class="si">{n}</span><span class="s2"> new messages."</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">format</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">n</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">n</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">'Trey, you have 3 new messages.'</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>Then Python 3.6 added a new string formatting syntax with <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/string-concatenation-and-string-interpolation/" target="_blank">f-strings</a>:</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="sa">f</span><span class="s2">"</span><span class="si">{</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">, you have </span><span class="si">{</span><span class="n">n</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2"> new messages."</span>
<span class="go">'Trey, you have 3 new messages.'</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>Now, Python 3.14 has yet another string interpolation syntax with t-strings:</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span><span class="s2">"</span><span class="si">{name}</span><span class="s2">, you have </span><span class="si">{n}</span><span class="s2"> new messages."</span>
<span class="go">Template(strings=('', ', you have ', ' new messages.'), interpolations=(Interpolation('Trey'</span>
<span class="go">, 'name', None, ''), Interpolation(3, 'n', None, '')))</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>Well, sort of!</p>

We thank Phyllis Dobbs for managing the RSVP process and the travel grants that enabled many contributors to join us in Cambridge.</p><p>Hosting the CPython Sprint at Arm’s Cambridge offices shows a shared commitment and we send huge thanks to everyone at Arm who made the sprint possible. Arm shares,&nbsp;<br /></p><blockquote><i>“Hosting the latest CPython sprint was more than providing a venue. It was an investment in strengthening one of the most influential open-source communities. Python’s reach is vast, and ensuring its modern components run smoothly on Arm platforms helps the language stay inclusive and performant across architectures. Hosting the sprint gave Arm a way to give back, reinforce bonds with the core team, and invest in Python’s future.”</i></blockquote>The Arm Software Communities team led the effort from start to finish, handling logistics, sponsorship, and every detail that kept things running smoothly. Their support, along with the help of Central Engineering, Facilities, Workplace, People, IT, Developer Marketing, and the Python Guild organizers, ensured a successful and well-organized week for all participants.&nbsp;<p></p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhFP_CiYxoHCWgaZ41foj7-gaL0kS2zB4DdSQiaOdV5Y6I6OuhXr6zte78R8a44TWg_qlSR3HEpnr7-X3dn6DVjhWb9H8BDTpqreGLOmKaqNO3LjQOXxTRn8qVIRnQed0tiI6cu0euG2awp5NJFMe1hBgPMc6nR_9UPq6ne_G2Ebw9MYFc_HQ/s4032/IMG_6754.jpeg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"></a><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhFP_CiYxoHCWgaZ41foj7-gaL0kS2zB4DdSQiaOdV5Y6I6OuhXr6zte78R8a44TWg_qlSR3HEpnr7-X3dn6DVjhWb9H8BDTpqreGLOmKaqNO3LjQOXxTRn8qVIRnQed0tiI6cu0euG2awp5NJFMe1hBgPMc6nR_9UPq6ne_G2Ebw9MYFc_HQ/s4032/IMG_6754.jpeg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"></a><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhKNsOU9QkbfWZ8tAd0WwY6_kBtfwWqMnhuwyvDgn2Zdvc-Fuio4eMEJ2D70QDplsiyp4wEaJT292ypwDvoQhgjAgZdhyphenhyphenOEs1MHcAwX7XCWh-b9vCww8oATXETa5CXSzs8C4k-m3LdlBLdU3_0KImFOaV88ARQPEdjubFEnmcQalwo8s-9cHQ/s5712/IMG_9026.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhFP_CiYxoHCWgaZ41foj7-gaL0kS2zB4DdSQiaOdV5Y6I6OuhXr6zte78R8a44TWg_qlSR3HEpnr7-X3dn6DVjhWb9H8BDTpqreGLOmKaqNO3LjQOXxTRn8qVIRnQed0tiI6cu0euG2awp5NJFMe1hBgPMc6nR_9UPq6ne_G2Ebw9MYFc_HQ/w400-h300/IMG_6754.jpeg" width="400" /><img border="0" height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhKNsOU9QkbfWZ8tAd0WwY6_kBtfwWqMnhuwyvDgn2Zdvc-Fuio4eMEJ2D70QDplsiyp4wEaJT292ypwDvoQhgjAgZdhyphenhyphenOEs1MHcAwX7XCWh-b9vCww8oATXETa5CXSzs8C4k-m3LdlBLdU3_0KImFOaV88ARQPEdjubFEnmcQalwo8s-9cHQ/w300-h400/IMG_9026.jpg" width="300" /></a></div></div>Finally, a huge thank you to all the attendees who traveled from across the world to spend a week in Cambridge. Some came from nearby in the UK and neighboring countries. Many others journeyed across Europe, several crossed the Atlantic, and a few took long-haul and even ultra-long-haul flights of more than 10,000 km. That dedication and commitment to the Python community is what truly made this sprint special.<p></p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh41GONKt-5VAvyO9SoLKDxGB8rnV9QRepkG8vVt9WVI3D5HuMZD8ePqlChqEmXp6phGtW_CSjIdlHX_qIhkiWXRUfUHEXPnzeLsBA-eqfFhbP_em56YGqXg4CZaeMcE8o5-iXpBt5AgUdkhp5dq9Q5M_0D5hf9Aoi5yJb8Owhc4HGA5JvKGQ/s5134/IMG_6666.jpeg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="270" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh41GONKt-5VAvyO9SoLKDxGB8rnV9QRepkG8vVt9WVI3D5HuMZD8ePqlChqEmXp6phGtW_CSjIdlHX_qIhkiWXRUfUHEXPnzeLsBA-eqfFhbP_em56YGqXg4CZaeMcE8o5-iXpBt5AgUdkhp5dq9Q5M_0D5hf9Aoi5yJb8Owhc4HGA5JvKGQ/w400-h270/IMG_6666.jpeg" width="400" /></a></div><p></p><p>Organizing a sprint of this scale takes many hands. From sponsors to volunteers, organizers to attendees, everyone contributed in their own way. This sprint was a reminder that Python is more than a programming language. It is a community that works together, supports one another, and achieves more as a team than any individual could alone.</p><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Conclusion</h2><p>The sprint was widely regarded as a success. Attendees described it as productive, well-organized, and an excellent community experience. Even so, some aspects could have been improved, and these are valuable lessons to take forward for future events.&nbsp;<br />Sessions such as the Steering Council Q&amp;A, the mentorship discussion led by Tania Allard, and the lightning talks stood out as highlights. They reinforced the value of bringing the community together in person.</p><p>Python is undergoing important technical transitions. Sprints like this accelerate evolution, resolve difficult challenges, and align the community. The concentration of expertise enabled focused, collaborative progress. The ripple effects of this sprint will shape code, discussion, and design decisions for months to come. We look forward to coming together again as a community.<br /><br /></p>

<li><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1ob3na1/i_built_a_tool_that_tells_you_how_hard_a_website/?featured_on=pythonbytes">reddit announcement and discussion</a></p></li>
<li><p>caniscrape checks a website for common anti-bot mechanisms and reports:</p>

<ul>
<li>A difficulty score (0–10)</li>
<li>Which protections are active (e.g., Cloudflare, Akamai, hCaptcha, etc.)</li>
<li>What tools you’ll likely need (headless browsers, proxies, CAPTCHA solvers, etc.)</li>
<li>Whether using a scraping API might be better</li>
</ul>

<p>This helps you decide the right scraping approach before you waste time building a bot that keeps getting blocked.</p></li>

            Python in 2025 is different. Threads really are about to run in parallel, installs finish before your coffee cools, and containers are the default. In this episode, we count down 38 things to learn this year: free-threaded CPython, uv for packaging, Docker and Compose, Kubernetes with Tilt, DuckDB and Arrow, PyScript at the edge, plus MCP for sane AI workflows. Expect practical wins and migration paths. No buzzword bingo, just what pays off in real apps. Join me along with Peter Wang and Calvin Hendrix-Parker for a fun, fast-moving conversation.
