            <p>The Django Software Foundation is announcing a call for Django Fellow applications. A Django Fellow is a contractor, paid by the Django Software Foundation, who dedicates time to maintain the Django framework.</p>
<p>The Fellowship program was started in 2014 as a way to dedicate high-quality and consistent resources to the maintenance of Django. The Django Software Foundation currently supports two Fellows –Natalia Bidart and Sarah Boyce– and has approved funding for a new full-time Fellow. This position will be initially for a period of one year, but may be extended depending on fundraising levels.</p>
<p>Beyond keeping Django running, a fellow is a representative of Django itself. They embody the welcoming culture of Django and aid the community to progress the framework. Fellows are often called upon to speak at Django conferences and events.</p>
<p>They are also usually leading Django Sprints occurring in conferences or other setups. Hence a Django Fellow often engages in both informal and formal mentorship.</p>
<h4 id="s-responsibilities">Responsibilities</h4>
<p>Fellow duties include (but are not limited to):</p>
<ul>
<li>Monitoring security reports and ensuring security issues are acknowledged and responded to promptly</li>
<li>Fixing release blockers and helping to backport fixes to these and security issues</li>
<li>Ensure timely releases including being a release manager for a new version of Django</li>
<li>Triaging tickets on Trac</li>
<li>Reviewing and merging pull requests</li>
<li>Answering contributor questions on the Forum</li>
<li>Helping new Django contributors land patches and learn our philosophy</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="s-requirements">Requirements</h4>
<p>A Django fellow reviews a very large amount of Django contributions. This requires knowledge in every aspect of web development that the Django framework touches. This turns out to be an intimidatingly-large list of technical topics, many of which are listed below. <strong>It’s not our expectation that you come into the job knowing everything on this list! </strong>We hope you’ll have solid experience in a few of these topics, particularly some of the “core” technologies important to Django (Python, relational databases, HTTP). But <strong>we fully expect that you’ll learn most of this on the job</strong>. <strong>A willingness to learn, and a demonstrated history of doing so, is more important than comprehensive knowledge.</strong> </p>
<p>The technical topics you can expect to work on  includes (and is not limited to):</p>
<ul>
<li>SQL and Databases: SQLite, MySQL, Postgres, Oracle</li>
<li>Technical Documentation</li>
<li>Javascript</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>Semantic HTML</li>
<li>Accessibility</li>
<li>UI/UX design (Web and CLI)</li>
<li>Python async </li>
<li>Python features (and versions), compatibility matrix, etc.</li>
<li>Everything around HTTP</li>
<li>Security best practices</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also:</p>
<ul>
<li>Complex processes which need adhering to</li>
<li>Multiple discussions which need opinions and direction</li>
<li>Requirements for both formal and informal mentorship</li>
</ul>
<p>And required professional skills such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conflict resolution</li>
<li>Time management and prioritization expertise</li>
<li>Ability to focus in short periods of time and do substantial context switches</li>
<li>Self-awareness to recognize their own limits and reach out for help</li>
<li>Relationship-building and coordination with Django teams, working groups, and potentially external parties.</li>
<li>Tenacity, patience, compassion and empathy are essential</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore a Django Fellow requires the skills and knowledge of a senior generalist engineer with extensive experience in Python and Django. Open source experience, especially in contributing to Django, is a big plus.</p>
<p>Being a Django contributor isn't a prerequisite for this position — we can help get you up to speed. We'll consider applications from anyone with a proven history of working with either the Django community or another similar open-source community. While no geographical location is required, we have a slight preference for timezones between around -8 and +3 UTC to allow for better working hours to overlap the current fellows.</p>
<p>If you're interested in applying for the position, please email us at <a href="mailto:fellowship-committee@djangoproject.com">fellowship-committee@djangoproject.com</a> describing why you would be a good fit along with details of your relevant experience and community involvement. Lastly, please include at least one recommendation.</p>
<p>The current hourly rate for a fellow is $82.26 USD.</p>
<p>Applicants will be evaluated based on the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>Details of Django and/or other open-source contributions</li>
<li>Details of community support in general</li>
<li>Understanding of the position</li>
<li>Clarity, formality, and precision of communications</li>
<li>Strength of recommendation(s)</li>
</ul>
<p>Applications will be open until midnight AoE, 1 July, 2025, with the expectation that the successful candidate will start around August 1, 2025.</p>
          </p>

<p><strong>Michael #1:</strong> <a href="https://pypi.org/project/platformdirs/?featured_on=pythonbytes"><strong>platformdirs</strong></a></p>

<ul>
<li>A small Python module for determining appropriate platform-specific dirs, e.g. a "user data dir".</li>
<li><strong>Why the community moved on from</strong> <strong>appdirs</strong> <strong>to</strong> <strong>platformdirs</strong></li>
<li>At AppDirs:
<ul>
<li>Note: This project has been officially deprecated. You may want to check out <a href="https://pypi.org/project/platformdirs/?featured_on=pythonbytes">pypi.org/project/platformdirs/</a> which is a more active fork of appdirs. Thanks to everyone who has used appdirs. Shout out to ActiveState for the time they gave their employees to work on this over the years.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Better than AppDirs:
<ul>
<li><strong>Works today, works tomorrow</strong> – new Python releases sometimes change low-level APIs (win32com, pathlib, Apple sandbox rules). platformdirs tracks those changes so your code keeps running.</li>
<li><strong>First-class typing</strong> – no more types-appdirs stubs; editors autocomplete paths as Path objects.</li>
<li><strong>Richer directory set</strong> – if you need a user’s <strong>Downloads</strong> folder or a per-session <strong>runtime dir</strong>, there’s a helper for it.</li>
<li><strong>Cleaner internals</strong> – rewritten to use pathlib, caching, and extensive test coverage; all platforms are exercised in CI.</li>
<li><strong>Community stewardship</strong> – the project lives in the PyPA orbit and gets security/compatibility patches quickly.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Pandas 3.0 will significantly boost performance by replacing NumPy with PyArrow as its default engine, enabling faster loading and reading of columnar data.</li>
<li>Recently <a href="https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/503/the-pyarrow-revolution?featured_on=pythonbytes">talked with Reuven Lerner about this on Talk Python too</a>.</li>
<li>In the next version, v3.0, PyArrow <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pdeps/0010-required-pyarrow-dependency.html?featured_on=pythonbytes">will be a required dependency</a>, with <em>pyarrow.string</em> being the default type inferred for string data.</li>
<li>PyArrow is 10 times faster.</li>
<li><a href="https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/index.html?featured_on=pythonbytes">PyArrow</a> offers <a href="https://thenewstack.io/apache-arrow-designed-accelerate-hadoop-spark-columnar-layouts-data/?featured_on=pythonbytes">columnar storage</a>, which eliminates all that computational back and forth that comes with NumPy. </li>
<li>PyArrow paves the way for running Pandas, by default, on <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/user_guide/copy_on_write.html?featured_on=pythonbytes">Copy on Write</a> mode, which improves memory and performance usage.</li>

  <li>“30 Snippet بلغة Python لكل مبرمج مبتدئ”.</li>
  <li>دليل شامل لتهيئة بيئة العمل في Node.js.</li>
  <li>شرح مفصل لمفاهيم Git للمبتدئين.</li>
</ul>

<p>لا تحتاج إلى تصوير فيديوهات أو إنشاء منصة كاملة. مجرد ملف PDF منظم قد يكون كافيًا.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="3--التخصص-في-النيتش-niche-البرمجي">3. 🎯 التخصص في النيتش (Niche) البرمجي</h2>

<p>اختر مجالًا فرعيًا ضيقًا داخل البرمجة – مثل إضافات المتصفحات، أو واجهات سطر الأوامر، أو الحوسبة السحابية للمبتدئين – وابدأ ببناء منتجات أو محتوى مدفوع يخدم هذا الجمهور المتخصص.</p>

<p><strong>الميزة:</strong>
سهولة بناء جمهور صغير لكنه وفيّ، مع فرص بيع عالية.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="4--تقديم-خدمات-دقيقة-microservices">4. 🎁 تقديم خدمات دقيقة (Microservices)</h2>

<p>بدلاً من تقديم خدمات عامة كـ”مطور ويب”، فكّر بتقديم خدمات دقيقة جدًا:</p>

<ul>
  <li>تركيب Google Analytics لموقع معين.</li>
  <li>تحسين سرعة تحميل موقع Shopify.</li>
  <li>إعداد سيرفر Nginx لموقع ووردبريس.</li>
</ul>

<p>يمكنك عرض هذه الخدمات على منصات مثل <a href="https://fiverr.com">Fiverr</a> أو حتى في ملفك الشخصي على GitHub مع نموذج طلب مباشر.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="5--إنشاء-موارد-تعليمية-مدفوعة">5. 💡 إنشاء موارد تعليمية مدفوعة</h2>

<p>تجربة شخصية أو مشروع صغير يمكن أن يتحول إلى <strong>مصدر تعليمي مدفوع</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>تسجيل شروحات مصغّرة وبيعها كدروس قصيرة.</li>
  <li>إنشاء دورة تفاعلية بلغة HTML + JS بدون فيديو.</li>
  <li>تصميم تمارين تفاعلية للمبتدئين في البرمجة.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="6--المشاركة-في-مسابقات-وتحديات-برمجية">6. 📊 المشاركة في مسابقات وتحديات برمجية</h2>

<p>بعض المنصات توفر جوائز مالية للمشاريع المفتوحة أو الحلول البرمجية:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://devpost.com">Devpost</a>: مسابقات مفتوحة في الذكاء الاصطناعي، الويب، وغيرها.</li>
  <li><a href="https://kaggle.com">Kaggle</a>: تحديات تحليل بيانات بمكافآت مالية.</li>
  <li><a href="https://topcoder.com">TopCoder</a>: مسابقات في الخوارزميات وتطوير البرمجيات.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="خاتمة-لا-تحصر-خياراتك-في-المسار-التقليدي">خاتمة: لا تحصر خياراتك في المسار التقليدي</h2>

<p>البرمجة ليست فقط أداة لتأدية مهام وظيفية، بل وسيلة لإنشاء قيمة يمكن تحويلها إلى دخل مباشر أو غير مباشر. من خلال التفكير بطريقة مختلفة واستهداف حاجات حقيقية، يمكنك تحويل حتى المهارات البسيطة إلى مصادر دخل مستمرة.</p>

<p>🚀 <em>ابدأ بمشروع صغير، اختبر السوق، وتعلّم مما تفعله… فقد يكون ذلك بداية لمصدر دخل جديد لم تتوقعه.</em></p>

<p>موقع <a href="https://onamae.com">onamae.com</a> الياباني يقدم أحيانًا عروضًا للحصول على **دومينات .com و .net وغيرها مجانًا  **.</p>

<h4 id="خطوات-التسجيل">خطوات التسجيل:</h4>

<ol>
  <li>ادخل إلى <a href="https://onamae.com">https://onamae.com</a></li>
  <li>الموقع باليابانية، لكن متصفح <strong>Chrome يترجم الصفحات تلقائيًا</strong>. إن لم تظهر الترجمة:</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>اضغط بزر الفأرة الأيمن على الصفحة واختر <strong>“Translate to English”</strong> (أو العربية حسب اللغة).</li>
  <li>أو فعّل الترجمة من إعدادات Chrome &gt; اللغات &gt; “عرض الترجمة عند زيارة صفحات بلغة مختلفة”.
    <ol>
      <li>ابحث عن اسم نطاق متاح.</li>
      <li>أتم التسجيل.</li>
      <li>احصل على إعدادات DNS الخاصة بالنطاق، سنحتاجها لاحقًا لربط النطاق بـ GitHub Pages.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>

            If you've heard the phrase "Automate the boring things" for Python, this episode starts with that idea and takes it to another level. We have Glyph back on the podcast to talk about "Programming YOUR computer with Python." We dive into a bunch of tools and frameworks and especially spend some time on integrating with existing platform APIs (e.g. macOS's BrowserKit and Window's COM APIs) to build desktop apps in Python that make you happier and more productive. Let's dive in!

            <p>Wing Python IDE version 11 is now available.  It improves the AI assisted development UI and adds
support for Claude, Grok, Gemini, OpenAI, Perplexity, Mistral, Deepseek, Ollama, and other OpenAI API
compatible AI providers.  Wing 11 also adds package management with <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">uv</span></tt>, improves Python code analysis,
updates the UI localizations, improves diff/merge, adds easier custom key binding assignment, and
much more.</p>
<p>Most of these improvements are available only in Wing Pro.  <a class="reference" href="/downloads">Compare Products</a>
for details.</p>

<strong>IMPORTANT</strong> Be sure to <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Check</span> <span class="pre">for</span> <span class="pre">Updates</span></tt> from Wing's <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Help</span></tt> menu after installing
so that you have the latest hot fixes.</div>

<p><a class="reference" href="/downloads/wing-101/11.0.1.0">Wing 101 11.0.1</a></p>
<p>Wing 10 and earlier versions are not affected by installation of Wing 11 and
may be installed and used independently. However, project files for Wing 10
and earlier are converted when opened by Wing 11 and should be saved under a
new name, since Wing 11 projects cannot be opened by older versions of Wing.</p>
<h2><img src="https://wingware.com/images/wing18.png" /> New in Wing 11</h2><h3>Improved AI Assisted Development</h3><p>Wing 11 improves the user interface for AI assisted development by introducing two separate
tools <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span> <span class="pre">Coder</span></tt> and <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span> <span class="pre">Chat</span></tt>. <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span> <span class="pre">Coder</span></tt> can be used to write, redesign, or extend code
in the current editor. <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span> <span class="pre">Chat</span></tt> can be used to ask about code or iterate in creating a
design or new code without directly modifying the code in an editor.</p>
<p>Wing 11's AI assisted development features now support not just OpenAI but also Claude, Grok,
Gemini, Perplexity, Mistral, Deepseek, and any other OpenAI completions API compatible AI provider.</p>
<p>This release also improves setting up AI request context, so that both automatically and
manually selected and described context items may be paired with an AI request. AI request
contexts can now be stored, optionally so they are shared by all projects, and may be used
independently with different AI features.</p>
<p>AI requests can now also be stored in the current project or shared with all projects, and Wing
comes preconfigured with a set of commonly used requests. In addition to changing code in the
current editor, stored requests may create a new untitled file or run instead in AI Chat. Wing
11 also introduces options for changing code within an editor, including replacing code,
commenting out code, or starting a diff/merge session to either accept or reject changes.</p>
<p>Wing 11 also supports using AI to generate commit messages based on the changes being committed
to a revision control system.</p>
<p>You can now also configure multiple AI providers for easier access to different models.</p>

<h3>Package Management with uv </h3><p>Wing Pro 11 adds support for the <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">uv</span></tt> package manager in the New Project dialog and the
Packages tool.</p>
<p>For details see <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Project</span> <span class="pre">Manager</span> <span class="pre">&gt;</span> <span class="pre">Creating</span> <span class="pre">Projects</span> <span class="pre">&gt;</span> <span class="pre">Creating</span> <span class="pre">Python</span> <span class="pre">Environments</span></tt> and <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Package</span>

<h3>Improved Python Code Analysis</h3><p>Wing 11 improves code analysis of literals such as dicts and sets, parametrized type
aliases, <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">typing.Self</span></tt>, type variables on the <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">def</span></tt> or <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">class</span></tt> line that declares
them, generic classes with <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">[...]</span></tt>, and <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">__all__</span></tt> in <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">*.pyi</span></tt> files.</p>
<h3>Updated Localizations</h3><p>Wing 11 updates the German, French, and Russian localizations, and introduces a new experimental
AI-generated Spanish localization. The Spanish localization and the new AI-generated strings in the
French and Russian localizations may be accessed with the new <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">User</span> <span class="pre">Interface</span> <span class="pre">&gt;</span> <span class="pre">Include</span> <span class="pre">AI</span>
<span class="pre">Translated</span> <span class="pre">Strings</span></tt> preference.</p>
<h3>Improved diff/merge</h3><p>Wing Pro 11 adds floating buttons directly between the editors to make navigating differences
and merging easier, allows undoing previously merged changes, and does a better job managing
scratch buffers, scroll locking, and sizing of merged ranges.</p>
<p>For details see <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Difference</span> <span class="pre">and</span> <span class="pre">Merge</span></tt> under <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Wing</span> <span class="pre">Manual</span></tt> in Wing 11's <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Help</span></tt> menu.</p>
<h3>Other Minor Features and Improvements</h3><p>Wing 11 also improves the custom key binding assignment user interface, adds a <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Files</span> <span class="pre">&gt;</span>
<span class="pre">Auto-Save</span> <span class="pre">Files</span> <span class="pre">When</span> <span class="pre">Wing</span> <span class="pre">Loses</span> <span class="pre">Focus</span></tt> preference, warns immediately when opening a project with
an invalid Python Executable configuration, allows clearing recent menus, expands the set of
available special environment variables for project configuration, and makes a number of other
bug fixes and usability improvements.</p>
<h3>Changes and Incompatibilities</h3><p>Since Wing 11 replaced the <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span></tt> tool with <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span> <span class="pre">Coder</span></tt> and <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span> <span class="pre">Chat</span></tt>, and AI
configuration is completely different than in Wing 10, you will need to reconfigure your
AI integration manually in Wing 11. This is done with <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Manage</span> <span class="pre">AI</span> <span class="pre">Providers</span></tt> in the
<tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span></tt> menu. After adding the first provider configuration, Wing will set that provider as
the default. You can switch between providers with <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Switch</span> <span class="pre">to</span> <span class="pre">Provider</span></tt> in the <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span></tt> menu.</p>

            Ce que je fabrique pendant mes « vacances » Pour une fois, j’écris ce billet en français. Après tout, c’est ma langue maternelle, et j’ai envie de partager ce que je fais ces derniers temps avec un peu plus de spontanéité.
Depuis fin avril, je suis en congé forcé. Mon contrat avec la Banque Européenne d’Investissement s’est terminé, et après deux années et demie de collaboration intense, passionnante et ultra-formante sur les sujets financiers et d’investissement, je me suis retrouvé avec… du temps.

            <p>In accordance with <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/security/">our security release policy</a>, the Django team
is issuing releases for
<a class="reference external" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/5.2.2/">Django 5.2.2</a>,

These releases address the security issues detailed below. We encourage all
users of Django to upgrade as soon as possible.</p>
<div class="section" id="s-cve-2025-48432-potential-log-injection-via-unescaped-request-path">
<h3>CVE-2025-48432: Potential log injection via unescaped request path</h3>
<p>Internal HTTP response logging used <tt class="docutils literal">request.path</tt> directly, allowing control
characters (e.g. newlines or ANSI escape sequences) to be written unescaped
into logs. This could enable log injection or forgery, letting attackers
manipulate log appearance or structure, especially in logs processed by
external systems or viewed in terminals.</p>
<p>Although this does not directly impact Django's security model, it poses risks
when logs are consumed or interpreted by other tools. To fix this, the internal
<tt class="docutils literal">django.utils.log.log_response()</tt> function now escapes all positional
formatting arguments using a safe encoding.</p>
<p>Thanks to Seokchan Yoon (<a class="reference external" href="https://ch4n3.kr/">https://ch4n3.kr/</a>) for the report.</p>

            <p>At the moment I'm <a class="reference external" href="http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2025/3/31/leaving/">working on a new project</a>.
Even over the last two months, the way I do this has changed profoundly.
Where I used to spend most of my time in Cursor, I now mostly use <a class="reference external" href="https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code">Claude
Code</a>, almost entirely
hands-off.</p>
<p>Do I program any faster?  Not really.  But it feels like I've gained 30%
more time in my day because the machine is doing the work.  I alternate
between giving it instructions, reading a book, and reviewing the changes.
If you would have told me even just six months ago that I'd prefer being
an engineering lead to a virtual programmer intern over hitting the keys
myself, I would not have believed it.  I can go can make a coffee, and
progress still happens.  I can be at the playground with my youngest while
work continues in the background.  Even as I'm writing this blog post,
Claude is doing some refactorings.</p>
<p>While all this is happening, I've found myself reflecting a lot on what AI
means to the world and I am becoming increasingly optimistic about our
future.  It's obvious now that we're undergoing a tremendous shift.  AI is
out of the bottle, and there's no putting it back.  Even if we halted all
progress today, froze the weights, halted the training, the systems
already out there would still reshape how we live, work, learn, and
communicate to one another.</p>
<p>What however took longer to accept is just how <em>profound</em> that change
really is.  As an engineer coming from a world of deterministic things,
who deeply values the craft of engineering, to accept the messiness of
what agents are doing took a while to digest.  It took me a while to even
warm up to tool usage by AI in the first place — just two years ago I was
convinced <a class="reference external" href="http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2023/2/17/the-killing-ai/">AI might kill my wife</a>.  In
those two years however we've come incredibly far.  We have reached the
point where even if we stopped here (and there is no indication we will)
AI is already a new substrate for a lot of new innovation, ideas and
creations and I'm here for it.  It has moved beyond being a curious tool.</p>
<p>Never before have I seen a technology surface in every day life so
quickly, so widely.  Smartphones adoption felt slow in comparison.  Today
I can't finish a commute or coffee without spotting someone chatting with
ChatGPT.  I've had conversations with baristas, hairdressers, parents at
the playground — people who aren't what I would consider “tech-savvy” —
telling me how AI changed the way they write letters, search for recipes,
help their kids with homework, or translate documents.  The ripple effect
is already massive. And still, the majority of the world hasn't touched
these tools yet.  Entire communities, professions, and economies are yet
to begin exploring their transformation.</p>
<p>That's what makes this moment feel so strange — half revolutionary, half
prelude.  And yet, oddly, there are so many technologists who are
holdouts.  How could techies reject this change?  Thomas Ptacek's piece
“<a class="reference external" href="https://fly.io/blog/youre-all-nuts/">My AI Skeptic Friends Are All Nuts</a>” really resonated with me.  It
takes a humorous stab at the push against AI that is taking place from my
very circles.  Why is it that so many people I've respected in tech for
years — engineers, open source contributors — are the ones most resistant
to what's happening?  We've built something beyond what we imagined, and
instead of being curious, many are dismissive and denying its
capabilities.  What is that?</p>
<p>Of course the implications are vast and real and the rapid development
forces big questions.  What does this mean for the education of our
children?  If AI can teach, explain, and personalize lessons better than a
classroom of thirty ever could, what becomes of schools as we know them?
And if kids grow up expecting to interact with intelligence — not just
absorb content — how do we teach them to reason, create, and collaborate
in ways that leverage this power without becoming dependent on it?</p>
<p>On the global stage, there are also ramifications that seem more
fundamental than in previous cycles.  It does not feel like the rise of
search engines or social media, where the rest of the world was satisfied
with being a consumer of US infrastructure.  This feels more like the
invention of the steam engine.  Once it existed, there was no future
without it.  No country could afford to stay on the sidelines.  But steam
machines also became quickly commoditized and there was plenty of
competition of manufacturers.  It was just too obvious of a technological
leap.  With AI, every nation, every corporation will want its own models,
its own control, its own stake in the future.</p>
<p>And so, as I alternate between delegating tasks to Claude and reading
something thoughtful in between, I can't help but feel excited about being
there when we're at the beginning of something irreversible and expansive.</p>
<p>I understand why it's tempting to be cynical or fearful.  For sure the job
of programmers and artists will change, but they won't vanish.  I feel
like all my skills that I learned as a programmer are more relevant than
ever, just with a new kind of tool. Likewise the abundance of AI generated
art also makes me so much more determined that I want to hire an excellent
designer as soon as I can.  People will always value well crafted
products.  AI might raise the bar for everybody all at once, but it's the
act of careful deliberation and very intentional creation that sets you
apart from everybody else.</p>
<p>Sure, I may have good personal reasons to be optimistic.  But the more
time I spend with these tools, the more I believe that optimism is the
more reasonable stance for everyone.  AI can dramatically increase human
agency when used well.  It can help us communicate across cultures.  It
can democratize access to knowledge.  It can accelerate innovation in
medicine, science, and engineering.</p>
<p>Right now it's messy and raw, but the path is clear: we are no longer just
using machines, we are now working with them.  And while it's early, I
think we'll look back at this decade the way past generations looked at
electricity or the printing press — not as a curiosity, but as the moment
when everything changed.</p>
<p>I encourage you not meet that moment with cynicism or fear: meet it with
curiosity, responsibility and the conviction that this future will be
bright and worth embracing.</p>

<p>In addition to the security fixed mentioned above, a few additional changes to the <code>ipaddress</code> were backported to make the security fixes feasible. (See the full changelogs for each release for more details.)</p>
<h1 style="text-align: left;">Python 3.13.4</h1>
<p>In addition to the security fixes, the fourth maintenance release of 
Python 3.13 contains more than 300 bugfixes, build improvements and 
documentation changes.</p><p><a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3134/">https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3134/</a></p>

<h1 style="text-align: left;">Python 3.9.23</h1>
<p>Additional security content in this release (already fixed in older releases for the other versions):</p>
<ul><li><a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/80222">gh-80222</a>:
 Fix bug in the folding of quoted strings when flattening an email 
message using a modern email policy. Previously when a quoted string was
 folded so that it spanned more than one line, the surrounding quotes 
and internal escapes would be omitted. This could theoretically be used 
to spoof header lines using a carefully constructed quoted string if the
 resulting rendered email was transmitted or re-parsed.</li></ul>

<p>Pikmin 2 is a treasure collect-a-thon for the GameCube.
One of the most distinguishing features of the treasures
is that they sometimes use real-life brands like <a href="https://www.pikminwiki.com/Courage_Reactor">Duracell</a>
and <a href="https://www.pikminwiki.com/Drought_Ender">Dr. Pepper</a>.</p>
<p>Pikmin 2 has <a href="https://www.pikminwiki.com/List_of_Pikmin_2_treasures">three distinct regional treasure hoards</a>, each with
unique treasures: US, JP, and PAL. I've only personally
played the US version of the game. I'd like to
try collecting all <strong>242 unique treasures</strong> across all three regions.</p>

<p>You can see my current progress below highlighted in green with timestamps
for when I collected the treasure. So far I have 98/242 treasures collected (40%). This table is <a href="http://sethmlarson.dev/feed#generating-the-table">automatically generated</a>
as I collect more treasure (when playing on real GameCube hardware).</p>

<p>If you're on mobile I recommend scrolling left and right on the table

<h2>Generating the table</h2>

<p>The table is laid out in an approximate order for collection taking into account
the region(s) the treasure is available in and the location in-game. I already own the US
region copy of Pikmin 2, I've purchased a JP region copy from eBay, and the <a href="https://www.pricecharting.com/game/pal-gamecube/pikmin-2">PAL region is on my wishlist</a>.</p>

<p>You can see that at a minimum to collect every treasure you need to complete
the <a href="https://www.pikminwiki.com/Hole_of_Heroes">Holes of Heroes</a> and the <a href="https://www.pikminwiki.com/Dream_Den">Dream Den</a> (final two caves of Pikmin 2) in both US and JP,
but neither cave has region-exclusive treasure in PAL.
This means it's probably optimal to leave PAL for the last playthrough.</p>

<p>The above treasure hoard was generated by copying the save data on my
<a href="https://www.8bitmods.wiki/memcard-pro-gc">Memcard Pro GC</a> regularly over time via FTP. The script to generate the table above
from a directory of memory card dumps (<code>.raw</code> files)
is <a href="https://gist.github.com/sethmlarson/6e83d8d0e4d6412ec8f9c27ec165fa51">available on GitHub</a>.</p>
