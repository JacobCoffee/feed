            <p>For July 2025, we welcome Jake Howard as our DSF member of the month! ⭐</p>
<p>Jake actively shares his knowledge through blog posts and community talks. He is part of the Security Team Working Group and he created the DEP 14. He has been a DSF member since June 2024. <br />
You can learn more about Jake by visiting <a href="https://theorangeone.net/">Jake's website</a> and <a href="https://github.com/RealOrangeOne">his GitHub Profile</a>.</p>
<p>Let’s spend some time getting to know Jake better!</p>
<h4 id="s-can-you-tell-us-a-little-about-yourself-hobbies-education-etc">Can you tell us a little about yourself (hobbies, education, etc)</h4>
<p>I’m Jake. I’m a Senior Systems Engineer at <a href="https://torchbox.com/">Torchbox</a>, where I’ve been for a little over 4 years. “Systems Engineer” is a fairly loaded title, and means different things to different people. I like to describe it as doing everything technical to do with Software Engineering which isn’t Programming (Sysadmin, Devops, IT support, Security, Networking), but also doing a fair bit of Programming.</p>
<p>Most of my hobbies revolve around technology. I’m an avid self-hoster, running applications on servers both in “the cloud” and in my house. There’s been a server of some kind in my house for the last 10 years. I’m generally quite a private person, so I like to know what’s happening to my data. Since I started working remotely at the start of the 2020 pandemic, I’ve channeled some of this passion into <a href="https://theorangeone.net/posts/">posts on my website</a>, with posts about all manner of things I’ve done from self-hosting to general software engineering.</p>
<p>Away from my desk (sort of), I’m a volunteer for <a href="https://studentrobotics.org/">Student Robotics</a>, inspiring college students into STEM through competitive robotics (no, not quite like Robot Wars). In school, I was always the quiet one, but now I seem completely at home with public speaking, commentary and otherwise being in front of large crowds of people. I wish I knew the secret - I’d make millions!</p>
<p>My <a href="https://github.com/RealOrangeOne/">GitHub</a> is also pretty active, with contributions all over the place (OpenZFS, Nebula VPN, Gitea, Plausible Analytics, OpenCV, Ansible…).</p>
<h4 id="s-im-curious-where-your-nickname-realorangeone-comes-from">I’m curious, where your nickname “RealOrangeOne” comes from?</h4>
<p>Because a lot of life happens online (especially in the last 5 years), many people haven’t even seen pictures of me, let alone met me in person. I am not in fact a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@AnnoyingOrange">talking piece of fruit</a>. For a while, I tried to stay anonymous, avoiding photos or videos of me on the internet. But since I discovered I enjoy public speaking, I’ve sort of given up on that (for the most part).</p>
<p>By now, I’m sure many people have speak. But, for those who don’t know: I, like my father before me, am ginger 🔥 (the hair colour, not the plant).</p>
<p>The exact specifics of how being ginger lead to “TheOrangeOne” are sadly lost to time. I’ve owned <code>theorangeone.net</code> for well over a decade at this point. Unfortunately, it’s not a particularly original nickname, and I have to be fast to claim it when signing up to new services. In some places (where I wasn’t fast enough) I’m forced to sub out “The” for “Real”, which has lead to some confusions, but not too many. Canonically, I prefer “TheOrangeOne”, but as we all know, naming things is hard.</p>
<h4 id="s-how-did-you-start-using-django">How did you start using Django?</h4>
<p>I’ve been using Django since around the 1.8 release. My job at the time was at a Django development agency, so it was the first real Python framework I’d used. The first few weeks there was my first exposure to Django, pip, package management and collaborative software engineering - it was quite a lot to learn at once. I didn’t realise it at the time, but I was working working as a junior alongside a couple fairly well-known names in the Django community like Tom Christie (DRF, Starlette, HTTPX) and Jamie Matthews (django-readers, django-zen-queries). We mostly built single-page apps with React, so I learned Django and Django Rest Framework at the same time, which means I now often have to look back at the docs to remember how forms and templates work.</p>
<p>As for contributing to Django, that came much later. My first commit to Django was in May 2024. Having used Django for a while, and written plenty of packages, I’d never stopped to look at how upstream was developed. Around the time of DEP 14 kicking off, I needed to look a bit more at the inner workings of the Django project, to learn what was in store for me. When scrolling through Trac tickets, I found <a href="https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/35467">an interesting looking ticket</a>, and got to work. At the time of writing, I’ve now closed <a href="https://code.djangoproject.com/query?owner=RealOrangeOne&amp;status=closed">9 Trac tickets</a> across <a href="https://github.com/django/django/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3ARealOrangeOne+is%3Aclosed">12 PRs</a>, and some pretty cool features (simple block tags, better Accept header parsing, performance improvements to the URL router) now have my name on them (metaphorically speaking).</p>
<p>I wouldn’t call myself an “active” contributor, but I try and keep an eye on the tickets and forum threads which interest me the most, and chime in when I can.</p>
<h4 id="s-what-other-framework-do-you-know-and-if-there-is-anything-you-would-like-to-have-in-django-if-you-had-magical-powers">What other framework do you know and if there is anything you would like to have in Django if you had magical powers?</h4>
<p>Since it’s the first framework I learned, and so far has done everything I need, I’ve mostly used Django. For a few smaller services, I’ve leaned more towards <a href="https://www.starlette.io/">Starlette</a> and <a href="https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/index.html">AIOHTTP</a>, but for anything even slightly large I’ve just used Django - since I’d end up recreating much of Django using the smaller frameworks anyway. A better (likely official) path for single-file Django (ie without some of the magic module handling) might help draw a few more people in and fill a few more of these “micro-service” style use-cases.</p>
<p>I’m a <a href="https://ccbv.co.uk/">class-based views</a> person - I like the encapsulation and easy extension of base views. As with any opinion on the internet, I’m sure many people disagree with me, but to me it’s just personal preference. I’m still surprised it’s a pattern not seen by many other Python frameworks.</p>
<p>Following in the footsteps of Python, I often wonder if Django could also do with some <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0594/">dead battery removal</a> (or at least extracting into separate packages). Django is a pretty big framework, and whilst the contrib apps are intended to be separate, they also require hooks and assumptions in other areas of the codebase. I might be wrong (it happens quite a lot), but I suspect some of those packages would be better suited externally, perhaps improving some developer momentum - and lightening the load for the Fellows. Django’s sitemap and syndication (RSS) frameworks are 2 places I wish would get some more love.</p>
<p>Outside of Python, I’m a big fan of Rust (as cliche as it may be). Whilst Rust is a popular language, there isn’t really a “Django” like (batteries included) framework - it’s all composing the pieces you need yourself. However, that doesn’t stop people being very productive with it. As a result, most of the frameworks have very generic interfaces, letting developers pass state around as needed, rather than trying to do everything themselves. Outside of the obvious static typing debate (which I’m in favour of), I’d love to see Django embrace some dependencies, especially if they bring some performance improvements. It may end up being a bad idea, but it might also help those who want to use Django’s modules outside of Django.</p>
<p>Many years ago, I tried to be a polyglot - switching between different programming languages (and frameworks) to find new ways of working and match the problem to the correct solution. Now, I’ve settled mostly on Python and Rust. They fit my needs well, I’m very productive in them, and between the 2 there’s not much they can’t handle. Given my background, and the fact most sysadmin-y tools are written in it, I’m really not a fan of Go.</p>
<h4 id="s-what-projects-are-you-working-on-now">What projects are you working on now?</h4>
<p>Over time, I’ve slowly stepped back from having big side projects - being a new dad sure takes up time and energy. Large projects ended up feeling too much like work outside of work, and I end up either getting distracted or bored. After work, I want to do something fun, not that seems like yet another job. I’m the kind of person who gets the sudden urge to research something interesting for an evening, dive in, then not think about it again for several weeks. It’s not the most productive way of doing things, which is why my posts are all over the place, but it doesn’t feel much like work for me - I lean heavily on what interests me at any time to drive what I want to do.</p>
<p>With that said, I’m currently in the process of rebuilding <a href="https://theorangeone.net/">my website</a>. Of course, both the current and new versions are built on Django, but the new build should be easier to maintain, faster, and hopefully won’t need rewriting again in just a couple years. Most of my other projects have been small tools to make my home server that bit nicer.</p>
<p>Professionally, I’m not really a developer anymore. As a sysadmin (ish), much of my day-to-day doesn’t involve much programming. I spend much more of my time deploying, monitoring and administering Django applications than I do writing them. My main project at the moment is helping port a large Java / JS deployment over to Django and Wagtail, running on Kubernetes with some very high and interesting stability and scaling requirements. Since most of my professional live has been at software agencies, I’ve tended to bounce between different projects, rather than sitting on a single one. So I’m also supporting on a few other smaller projects as and when I’m needed.</p>
<h4 id="s-which-django-libraries-are-your-favorite-core-or-3rd-party">Which Django libraries are your favorite (core or 3rd party)?</h4>
<p><a href="https://github.com/RealOrangeOne/django-tasks">django-tasks</a>, of course!</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Oh right, a serious answer…</p>
<p>I have to say, one of the most underrated modules in Django is <code>django.utils</code>. It’s not as glamourous as the ORM, forms or cache, but it’s a treasure trove of useful methods. I personally always like looking at the internal helper functions large frameworks use - see the problems they’ve had to solve time and time again. Whilst there’s not the same stability guarantees, I’ve definitely been helped out on a few occasions by some undocumented functions.</p>
<p>In that theme, I’m a fan of libraries which do one thing and do it well. I quite like small libraries which aim to solve a problem. There’s definitely a line before that becomes a problem (anyone remember <code>left-pad</code>?), but libraries which scope creep are often harder to work with than the more narrow-scoped ones, whilst the smaller ones just keep on working and making my life easier. For example, <a href="https://django-environ.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">django-environ</a> makes reading and parsing environment variables into settings really easy and clean, and <a href="https://pypi.org/project/django-decorator-include/">django-decorator-include</a> helps including other <code>urlpatterns</code> whilst wrapping them in a decorator - particularly helpful for 3rd-party package’s URLs.</p>
<p>Finally, I’ve got a real soft-spot for <a href="https://whitenoise.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">whitenoise</a> (and ServeStatic for <a href="https://archmonger.github.io/ServeStatic/latest/">ASGI</a> users). Django’s documentation deters people pretty hard from serving media and static files using Django - and rightly so in performance-critical environments. However, for most people, having to additionally maintain (and secure) <code>nginx</code> is more maintenance than necessary. <code>whitenoise</code> serves static files using Django directly, without any extra configuration, whilst also pre-compressing files for a nice performance boost. To me, it’s such a universally-useful library, I’d love to see it it included in Django itself someday.</p>
<p>I’ll throw a bonus shout out for <a href="https://github.com/emmett-framework/granian">granian</a>, a new (ish) WSGI / ASGI server written in Rust. <a href="https://docs.gunicorn.org/en/stable/">gunicorn</a> has a near monopoly on running Python apps in production, especially in the WSGI space, so it’s nice to see a newcomer. granian isn’t always faster, but doing the HTTP handling in Rust (and using popular libraries to do it) can improve stability and throughput, without holding the GIL. I’ve not run anything in production with it yet, but I’ve been using it on personal projects for almost a year without issue.</p>
<h4 id="s-what-are-the-top-three-things-in-django-that-you-like">What are the top three things in Django that you like?</h4>
<p>Contrary to what I’ve already said, I actually like Django’s batteries. Sure, there’s quite a few “dead” ones in need of some cleaning up and TLC, but having most of what I need already installed makes me far more productive. I don’t need to think about how to render my form on the page, save the results as a model, or properly handle errors - everything “just works”, and works together. Sure, batteries have their downsides - it makes swapping them out rather difficult, but I’d rather ship my feature sooner than compare the trade-offs of different ORMs. The auto-reloading in <code>django-tasks</code> is only around <a href="https://github.com/RealOrangeOne/django-tasks/pull/152/files#diff-014cdd86e0b6702bf4fc2bc785082586d7546e29405f465026ac9eb51cb341e9R260-R268">8 lines of code</a> thanks to <code>django.utils.autoreload</code> being so easy to hook in to.</p>
<p>Secondly: Forms, but not for the reasons you might think. Most forms are created to take submissions from the user, validate them, then probably save them to a model. However, they’re great as general data validation. I’ve written plenty of views with complex querystring requirements, and leaning on forms to validate them saves a lot of boilerplate code. Sure, <code>pydantic</code> might be a bit faster and have more features, but given I’m already productive with <code>django.forms</code>, and it’s already installed and well understood by other developers in my team, I don’t feel the need to reach for something else.</p>
<p>Finally, I wouldn’t say it’s quite a “favourite”, and it’s well-known as being far-from-perfect, but I’ve got a real soft-spot for the Django Admin. It lets me focus on building the core of an application, rather than the internal interface - particularly when there are no strong requirements for it, or it’s only going to be used by me and a few others. Since it’s a fair raw view of the database by default, I’ve definitely been bitten by some less-than-restrictive permissions, but there’s generally all the hooks I need. I don’t like building frontends, so only needing to build 1 rather than 2 makes me a lot happier, especially if it comes with authentication, permissions, read-only views and a dark mode 😎!</p>
<h4 id="s-how-did-you-join-the-security-team">How did you join the security team?</h4>
<p>I’d love to say it’s an interesting story, stroking my ego that I saved the day. But the reality is, as usual, far less glamorous.</p>
<p>As an engineer, I’ve tended towards 2 specialties: Security and Performance, which usually go hand-in-hand. In early 2023, I was invited to join the <a href="https://wagtail.org/">Wagtail CMS</a> Security team after reporting and subsequently helping fix a <a href="https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/security/advisories/GHSA-33pv-vcgh-jfg9">memory exhaustion issue</a>. I was already involved in all things security at Torchbox, especially our ISO-27001 certification, so I was already known when I submitted a vulnerability report.</p>
<p>Thibaud mentioned to me late last year that the project potentially looking for new members of the security team, to help with resourcing and some potential process improvements within the foundation. I naturally jumped at the opportunity - since the team is generally closed to new members and “fully-staffed”. After a few gentle reminders (he’s a busy guy), I received a message from Sarah formally inviting me in March.</p>
<p>Since then, I’ve tried to review every report which came through, and helped author a few patches. A few reports even had to be raised upstream with Python’s <a href="https://devguide.python.org/developer-workflow/psrt/">Security Response Team</a> (PSRT). It’s been an interesting experience, and I’m looking forward to seeing how the team developers over the coming years.</p>
<h4 id="s-im-aware-that-you-have-created-dep-14-on-the-background-workers-how-the-work-is-going-so-far-do-you-need-support-from-the-community-on-anything">I’m aware that you have created DEP 14 on the Background Workers, how the work is going so far? Do you need support from the community on anything?</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2024/may/29/django-enhancement-proposal-14-background-workers/">DEP 14</a> (the proposal to add a native background workers API to Django) has been a really interesting journey. I’m beyond humbled to see the community interest behind it. When I started down this road, I’d only intended to start the conversations and help rally the community interest. Since then, and 6000 lines of code later, I’m mostly single-handedly writing a database-backed production-grade task system.</p>
<p>Right now, we’re at a bit of a cross-roads. Many of the foundational parts work, relatively well. The difficulty comes with the more complex features: Retries, dependencies, robust execution. Building a task system is easy - building a reliable one people want to actually use is incredibly difficult. If anyone out there is interested in getting involved, please do! <a href="https://github.com/realOrangeOne/django-tasks">Report issues</a>, fix bugs, <a href="https://github.com/RealOrangeOne/django-tasks/discussions">contribute to design discussions</a>. Most of the APIs are based on what I think looks sensible. Software this large, pivotal and complex can’t be built in isolation - so it needs a diverse audience to ensure we (I) make the right decisions, and design an API people actually want to use that will last and scale for years to come.</p>
<p>The next challenge on my list to tackle is timeouts - a highly requested feature. It sounds simple, but the reality is far from it. Many of those challenges sparked the topic of my upcoming <a href="https://2025.pyconuk.org/">PyCon UK</a> talk later this year.</p>
<h4 id="s-django-is-celebrating-its-20th-anniversary-this-month-any-nice-story-to-share">Django is celebrating its 20th anniversary this month. Any nice story to share?</h4>
<p>My personal highlight was <a href="https://2024.djangocon.eu/">DjangoCon Europe 2024</a> - my first DjangoCon. I ended up bringing the stereotypically grey British weather with me, but I had a great week chatting Django with some interesting people, and putting faces to the names and handles I’d seen online. After the <a href="https://theorangeone.net/talks/empowering-django-with-background-workers/">talk</a> announcing DEP 14 and background tasks, I was inundated with people voicing their support - many wondering how it’d taken this long.</p>
<p>But personally, I’m more interested in what’s to come. Of course, there’s <code>django-tasks</code>, but the next sets of releases are shaping up to be pretty interesting. Over the last 3-4 years or so, I’ve personally noticed a bit of a resurgence in people’s <a href="https://github.com/django/new-features/issues">appetites for change</a> in Django. The 6.x Steering Council have a lot of interesting ideas, and clearly the community agree. People are happy with what Django can do now, but want to bring it a little more up-to-date - and are happy to put in the work to do it. Only a few weeks ago, <a href="https://github.com/django/django/pull/19393">django-csp was included in core</a>, making it easier to make more secure applications. I’m sure that’s just the start. The fact people are still keen on working on a framework which just celebrated 20 years shows it must be doing something right!</p>
<h4 id="s-is-there-anything-else-youd-like-to-say">Is there anything else you’d like to say?</h4>
<p>I’d like to thank whoever nominated me to be a DSF member in the first place. To this date, I have no idea who you are.</p>
<p>Beyond that, I’m just looking forward to seeing what comes of Django, and Python in general over the next few years.</p>

            <p>Wing Python IDE version 11.0.3 has been released.  It improves Python code analysis,
fixes problems debugging Django templates, fixes refactoring when the target file
is in a hidden directory, and makes a number of other minor improvements.</p>
<img alt="Wing 11 Screen Shot" class="eye-candy-image unfloat-at-900" src="https://wingware.com/images/screenshots/wing11-screenshot.png" width="650px" /><h3>Downloads</h3><div class="note">
Be sure to <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Check</span> <span class="pre">for</span> <span class="pre">Updates</span></tt> in Wing's <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Help</span></tt> menu after downloading, to make
sure that you have the latest hot fixes.</div>

<p><a class="reference" href="/downloads/wing-101/11.0.3.0">Wing 101 11.0.3</a></p>
<p>Wing 10 and earlier versions are not affected by installation of Wing 11 and
may be installed and used independently. However, project files for Wing 10
and earlier are converted when opened by Wing 11 and should be saved under a
new name, since Wing 11 projects cannot be opened by older versions of Wing.</p>
<h2><img src="https://wingware.com/images/wing18.png" /> New in Wing 11</h2><h3>Improved AI Assisted Development</h3><p>Wing 11 improves the user interface for AI assisted development by introducing two separate
tools <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span> <span class="pre">Coder</span></tt> and <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span> <span class="pre">Chat</span></tt>. <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span> <span class="pre">Coder</span></tt> can be used to write, redesign, or extend code
in the current editor. <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span> <span class="pre">Chat</span></tt> can be used to ask about code or iterate in creating a
design or new code without directly modifying the code in an editor.</p>
<p>Wing 11's AI assisted development features now support not just OpenAI but also Claude, Grok,
Gemini, Perplexity, Mistral, Deepseek, and any other OpenAI completions API compatible AI provider.</p>
<p>This release also improves setting up AI request context, so that both automatically and
manually selected and described context items may be paired with an AI request. AI request
contexts can now be stored, optionally so they are shared by all projects, and may be used
independently with different AI features.</p>
<p>AI requests can now also be stored in the current project or shared with all projects, and Wing
comes preconfigured with a set of commonly used requests. In addition to changing code in the
current editor, stored requests may create a new untitled file or run instead in AI Chat. Wing
11 also introduces options for changing code within an editor, including replacing code,
commenting out code, or starting a diff/merge session to either accept or reject changes.</p>
<p>Wing 11 also supports using AI to generate commit messages based on the changes being committed
to a revision control system.</p>
<p>You can now also configure multiple AI providers for easier access to different models.</p>
<p>For details see <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span> <span class="pre">Assisted</span> <span class="pre">Development</span></tt> under <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Wing</span> <span class="pre">Manual</span></tt> in Wing 11's <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Help</span></tt> menu.</p>
<h3>Package Management with uv </h3><p>Wing Pro 11 adds support for the <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">uv</span></tt> package manager in the New Project dialog and the
Packages tool.</p>
<p>For details see <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Project</span> <span class="pre">Manager</span> <span class="pre">&gt;</span> <span class="pre">Creating</span> <span class="pre">Projects</span> <span class="pre">&gt;</span> <span class="pre">Creating</span> <span class="pre">Python</span> <span class="pre">Environments</span></tt> and <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Package</span>

<h3>Improved Python Code Analysis</h3><p>Wing 11 makes substantial improvements to Python code analysis, with better support for
literals such as dicts and sets, parametrized type aliases, <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">typing.Self</span></tt>, type of
variables on the <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">def</span></tt> or <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">class</span></tt> line that declares them, generic classes with
<tt class="literal"><span class="pre">[...]</span></tt>, <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">__all__</span></tt> in <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">*.pyi</span></tt> files, subscripts in <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">typing.Type</span></tt> and similar, type
aliases, type hints in strings, <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">type[...]</span></tt> and <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">tuple[...]</span></tt>,
<tt class="literal"><span class="pre">&#64;functools.cached_property</span></tt>, base classes found also in <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">.pyi</span></tt> files, and
<tt class="literal"><span class="pre">typing.Literal[...]</span></tt>.</p>
<h3>Updated Localizations</h3><p>Wing 11 updates the German, French, and Russian localizations, and introduces a new experimental
AI-generated Spanish localization. The Spanish localization and the new AI-generated strings in the
French and Russian localizations may be accessed with the new <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">User</span> <span class="pre">Interface</span> <span class="pre">&gt;</span> <span class="pre">Include</span> <span class="pre">AI</span>
<span class="pre">Translated</span> <span class="pre">Strings</span></tt> preference.</p>
<h3>Improved diff/merge</h3><p>Wing Pro 11 adds floating buttons directly between the editors to make navigating differences
and merging easier, allows undoing previously merged changes, and does a better job managing
scratch buffers, scroll locking, and sizing of merged ranges.</p>
<p>For details see <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Difference</span> <span class="pre">and</span> <span class="pre">Merge</span></tt> under <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Wing</span> <span class="pre">Manual</span></tt> in Wing 11's <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Help</span></tt> menu.</p>
<h3>Other Minor Features and Improvements</h3><p>Wing 11 also improves the custom key binding assignment user interface, adds a <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Files</span> <span class="pre">&gt;</span>
<span class="pre">Auto-Save</span> <span class="pre">Files</span> <span class="pre">When</span> <span class="pre">Wing</span> <span class="pre">Loses</span> <span class="pre">Focus</span></tt> preference, warns immediately when opening a project with
an invalid Python Executable configuration, allows clearing recent menus, expands the set of
available special environment variables for project configuration, and makes a number of other
bug fixes and usability improvements.</p>
<h3>Changes and Incompatibilities</h3><p>Since Wing 11 replaced the <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span></tt> tool with <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span> <span class="pre">Coder</span></tt> and <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span> <span class="pre">Chat</span></tt>, and AI
configuration is completely different than in Wing 10, you will need to reconfigure your
AI integration manually in Wing 11. This is done with <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Manage</span> <span class="pre">AI</span> <span class="pre">Providers</span></tt> in the
<tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span></tt> menu. After adding the first provider configuration, Wing will set that provider as
the default. You can switch between providers with <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Switch</span> <span class="pre">to</span> <span class="pre">Provider</span></tt> in the <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span></tt> menu.</p>

    <h2>A function defined within a function</h2>
    
      
        <p>Python's functions can be defined <em>pretty much anywhere</em>.</p>

      
        <p>You can even define a function inside a function:</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">greet_me</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"friend"</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">greet</span><span class="p">():</span>
        <span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"Hello"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">name</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">greet</span><span class="p">()</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>When we call this <code>greet_me</code> function, it defines a <code>greet</code> a function and then calls that function:</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">greet_me</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="go">Hello friend</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>Note that the inner function is allowed to use the <code>name</code> from the outer function.</p>

      
    
  
    <h2>A function returned from another function</h2>
    
      <p>Instead of calling our inner …</p>

        <div class="p-4 flex-grow overflow-hidden">
          <p class="text-base-content">
            <p>لا يوجد اليوم أي مشروع برمجي، سواء كان تطبيق جوال أو تطبيق ويب، إلا وغالباً ما يعتمد على واجهة برمجة تطبيقات (API). واجهة برمجة التطبيقات هذه هي ما نعرفها في مفهومنا بالواجهة الخلفية (Backend). ولكن لكي نفهم ما تعنيه واجهة برمجة التطبيقات ونتحدث عن هذا الموضوع باستفاضة أكبر، دعونا ننتقل إلى مستوى أكثر تفصيلاً، وهو فكرة انتقال البيانات عبر الشبكة.</p>

<h3 id="فهم-بنية-التطبيقات-الحديثة">فهم بنية التطبيقات الحديثة</h3>

<p>عندما نتحدث عن بنية تطبيق نموذجي، يمكننا تقسيمه إلى الأجزاء التالية:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>الواجهة الأمامية (Frontend):</strong> هي الجزء الموجه للمستخدم الذي يتفاعل معه مباشرة، سواء كان تطبيق جوال أو موقع ويب.</li>
  <li><strong>الواجهة الخلفية (Backend):</strong> تعمل على خادم (Server) على السحابة (Cloud)، وتتصل بقاعدة بيانات (Database) لحفظ واسترجاع البيانات. قد تتواصل الواجهة الخلفية أيضاً مع خدمات (Services) أخرى.</li>
  <li><strong>قاعدة البيانات (Database):</strong> حيث يتم تخزين كافة معلومات التطبيق.</li>
</ul>

<p>كل هذا التفاعل في جانب الخادم يحدث بعيداً عن المستخدم.</p>

<h3 id="دور-واجهات-برمجة-التطبيقات-restful-apis">دور واجهات برمجة التطبيقات (RESTful APIs)</h3>

<p>عندما نتحدث عن الاتصال بين الواجهة الأمامية والواجهة الخلفية، فإنه يتم عبر الشبكة باستخدام بروتوكول <code class="highlighter-rouge">HTTP</code>. معيار <code class="highlighter-rouge">HTTP</code> ينص على أنه لكي تطلب شيئًا من الخادم، فإنك ترسل له <strong>طلبًا (Request)</strong>، وهذا الطلب يحتوي على نوع الطريقة (Method) والبيانات المطلوبة. بعد ذلك، يرد الخادم <strong>باستجابة (Response)</strong>، وهذه الاستجابة توضح ما إذا كانت العملية قد تمت بنجاح أم لا، من خلال ما يسمى <strong>برمز الحالة (Status Code)</strong>.</p>

<p>هذه هي الفكرة الأساسية لواجهات برمجة التطبيقات من نوع RESTful API، حيث تكون الواجهة الخلفية مفتوحة على الشبكة بحيث يمكن لأي تطبيق واجهة أمامية التواصل معها عبر بروتوكول <code class="highlighter-rouge">HTTP</code>. إنه معيار موحد، ولا توجد أي مشكلة على الإطلاق في أن أي نوع من التكنولوجيا قد يتغير أو يتطور لاحقًا سيظل يستخدم بروتوكول <code class="highlighter-rouge">HTTP</code>. حتى إن الواجهة الأمامية تسمى عميل <code class="highlighter-rouge">HTTP</code> (HTTP Client)، والواجهة الخلفية تكون هي خادم RESTful API.</p>

<h3 id="تحدي-الربط-بين-الواجهات-الأمامية-والخلفية">تحدي الربط بين الواجهات الأمامية والخلفية</h3>

<p>في سوق العمل اليوم، غالبًا ما يكون مطور الواجهة الخلفية شخصًا لا علاقة له بمطور الواجهة الأمامية. بمعنى أنه يمكن أن يأتي مطور تطبيقات جوال ليبني شاشات التطبيق، ويأتي مطور آخر يعمل على الواجهة الخلفية لينشئ واجهات برمجة التطبيقات. ثم يأتي دور عملية الربط بين هذين الجزأين.</p>

<p>عملية الربط هذه تتطلب أن يكون التواصل بين المطورين واضحًا وصريحًا. فمطور الواجهة الأمامية ليس لديه خلفية عما تم بناؤه في الواجهة الخلفية. وبالتأكيد لن يكون فعالاً أن تقول له: “تفضل، هذا هو الرمز البرمجي، ونقاط النهاية (Endpoints) مكتوبة فيه، ابحث بنفسك هل هذه <code class="highlighter-rouge">GET</code> أم <code class="highlighter-rouge">POST</code> أم <code class="highlighter-rouge">PUT</code>؟”. أو حتى أنت شخصيًا، لو كنت من بنى الواجهة الخلفية، قد تنسى تفاصيل ما بنيته أو كيف كان شكل البيانات التي يتلقاها الطلب.</p>

<h3 id="الحل-توثيق-واجهات-برمجة-التطبيقات-api-documentation">الحل: توثيق واجهات برمجة التطبيقات (API Documentation)</h3>

<p>من أجل حل مشكلة هذه العشوائية، حيث يضطر المطورون لتخمين هيئة الطلب أو أسماء الخصائص في كائن <code class="highlighter-rouge">JSON</code> المرسل، نقوم بعمل <strong>توثيق لواجهة برمجة التطبيقات (API Documentation)</strong>. الهدف من هذا التوثيق هو تسجيل جميع نقاط النهاية الموجودة في الواجهة الخلفية بشكل منهجي.</p>

<p>يمكن بعد ذلك مشاركة هذا التوثيق مع أي شخص سيستخدم الواجهة الخلفية، بحيث عندما ينظر إليه، يفهم بوضوح:</p>
<ul>
  <li>ما هي نقطة النهاية.</li>
  <li>ما هو نوعها (<code class="highlighter-rouge">GET</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">POST</code>, etc.).</li>
  <li>ما هي البيانات التي تعيدها.</li>
</ul>

<p>وهكذا يستطيع بناء المنطق البرمجي لديه بناءً على هذا التوثيق الواضح.</p>

<h3 id="أدوات-التوثيق-الشائعة">أدوات التوثيق الشائعة</h3>

<p>أفضل طريقة اليوم لتوثيق واجهة برمجة التطبيقات هي استخدام الأدوات التي تنشئ صفحة ويب تفاعلية للواجهة الخلفية تحتوي على قائمة بجميع نقاط النهاية.</p>

<h4 id="1-swagger-openapi">1. Swagger (OpenAPI)</h4>
<p>باستخدام Swagger، يمكنك توثيق كل نقاط النهاية الخاصة بك والسماح للمطورين بتجربتها مباشرة من المتصفح. يمكنهم رؤية ماذا تتلقى في الطلب (Request)، وكيف تبدو الاستجابة (Response)، وإذا كانت تتلقى ترويسات (Headers) مثل رمز المصادقة (Authentication Token)، فكيف يكون شكله وما اسمه. كل هذه الأمور تكون موثقة، مما يحل مشاكل هائلة في عملية التكامل ويمنع التخمين العشوائي وإضاعة الوقت.</p>

<h4 id="أهمية-الإصدارات-versioning">أهمية الإصدارات (Versioning)</h4>
<p>يصبح التوثيق مهماً جداً عند إصدار نسخ (Versioning) لواجهات برمجة التطبيقات. فعندما تنشئ إصدارًا جديدًا (e.g., <code class="highlighter-rouge">/v2/users</code>) بميزات جديدة، يمكنك توثيقه بشكل منفصل. وعندما يرغب المطور في الترقية من <code class="highlighter-rouge">/v1</code> إلى <code class="highlighter-rouge">/v2</code>، سيتمكن من النظر إلى التوثيق لمعرفة الفروقات وكيفية إجراء الترقية بسهولة.</p>

<h4 id="2-postman">2. Postman</h4>
<p>Postman أداة أخرى هائلة ومستخدمة على نطاق واسع. فكرتها تشبه Swagger ولكنها أداة مستقلة غير مرتبطة مباشرة بالواجهة الخلفية. بينما يتم تثبيت Swagger داخل مشروع الواجهة الخلفية نفسه، يعمل Postman كتطبيق منفصل.</p>

<p><strong>ميزات Postman:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>الاستقلالية:</strong> يعمل كأداة منفصلة، مما يسمح لك بتنظيم المجموعات (Collections) بمعزل عن كود الواجهة الخلفية.</li>
  <li><strong>التعاون:</strong> يمكنك إنشاء فرق عمل ودعوة مطورين آخرين ومشاركة المجموعات معهم.</li>
  <li><strong>التحكم في الوصول:</strong> يمكنك التحكم في صلاحيات الوصول لكل عضو في الفريق، وتحديد المجموعات التي يمكنه رؤيتها.</li>
  <li><strong>ميزات متقدمة:</strong> يدعم متغيرات البيئة (Environment Variables) وإنشاء أمثلة (Examples) متعددة لكل طلب.</li>
</ul>

<p>يعتبر Postman أداة أكثر ثراءً ومرونة، مما يجعله خيارًا قويًا لإدارة واختبار واجهات برمجة التطبيقات المعقدة.</p>

<p>كمطور واجهة خلفية، يجب عليك دائمًا مراعاة <strong>أفضل الممارسات (Best Practices)</strong> في تكوين واجهات برمجة التطبيقات. فالتوثيق الجيد لا يغني عن التصميم السيء. بناء الواجهات البرمجية وتسميتها وتوظيفها بشكل صحيح يريحك أنت وفريقك في عمليات التعديل المستقبلية.</p>

<p><strong>خلاصة أفضل الممارسات:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">POST</code></strong>: لإنشاء موارد جديدة.</li>
  <li><strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">GET</code></strong>: لاسترجاع البيانات.</li>
  <li><strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">PUT</code></strong>: للتحديث الكامل لمورد موجود.</li>
  <li><strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">PATCH</code></strong>: للتحديث الجزئي لمورد موجود.</li>
  <li><strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">DELETE</code></strong>: لحذف مورد.</li>
</ul>

<p>من الكوارث الشائعة استخدام <code class="highlighter-rouge">POST</code> لكل شيء، وتسمية نقاط النهاية بشكل وصفي للفعل مثل: <code class="highlighter-rouge">/user/delete</code> أو <code class="highlighter-rouge">/user/create</code>. هذا ليس معيارياً. الطريقة الصحيحة هي استخدام اسم المورد (e.g., <code class="highlighter-rouge">/users</code>) ثم استخدام أفعال <code class="highlighter-rouge">HTTP</code> المناسبة للتعامل معه.</p>

<h3 id="خاتمة">خاتمة</h3>

<p>ظهرت اليوم حلول مثل GraphQL التي تحاول تبسيط بعض هذه الجوانب، ولكن لا تزال RESTful API هي الأصل والمعيار العالمي في التكامل بين الواجهات الخلفية والأمامية. بغض النظر عن التقنيات المستخدمة في كل طرف، يظل RESTful API هو الجسر الموحد الذي يضمن تواصلاً سلساً وفعالاً. إن اتباع أفضل الممارسات وتوفير توثيق واضح ودقيق هو مفتاح نجاح أي مشروع برمجي حديث.</p>

            <h3 id="مقدمة-ما-هو-الإنترنت-الذي-نعرفه">مقدمة: ما هو الإنترنت الذي نعرفه؟</h3>
<p>قديماً، عندما كنا نسمع كلمة “إنترنت”، كنا نفكر مباشرة في الأشياء التي نراها مثل جوجل، فيسبوك، ويوتيوب. وبالفعل، هذا هو الجزء الذي نتعامل معه كل يوم. لكن، هل هذا هو الشيء الوحيد الموجود حقًا؟ تابع معي.</p>

<h3 id="الطبقة-الأولى-الإنترنت-السطحي-surface-web">الطبقة الأولى: الإنترنت السطحي (Surface Web)</h3>
<p>الأشياء التي ذكرناها في البداية، مثل جوجل، فيسبوك، ويوتيوب، هي جزء صغير جدًا من الإنترنت. كأنك ترى قمة الجبل الجليدي الذي يطفو فوق الماء، بينما الجزء الأكبر مختبئ تحته. ما نراه يُسمى “الإنترنت السطحي” (Surface Web).</p>

<p>هذا هو الجزء الذي يمكنك الوصول إليه بسهولة. بمجرد أن تكتب الكلمة التي تريدها في جوجل، على سبيل المثال، تجد ملايين النتائج. يمكنك الدخول على أي نتيجة منها، تقرأ مقالًا، أو تستعرض محتوى. كل شيء متاح ومفتوح لأي شخص. بمعنى آخر، هي المواقع التي لا يتطلب دخولها بالضرورة إنشاء حساب، مثل جوجل أو يوتيوب، حيث يمكنك تصفحها بشكل طبيعي جدًا دون الحاجة لحساب.</p>

<p><strong>ملاحظة هامة:</strong>
رغم أن هذا هو الجزء الأكثر شهرة، إلا أنه لا يمثل أكثر من <strong>5%</strong> من الحجم الحقيقي للإنترنت. تخيل أن كل ما تراه على الإنترنت يوميًا من مواقع وأخبار ومقالات هو فقط 5%. فأين الـ 95% الباقية؟</p>

<h3 id="الطبقة-الثانية-الإنترنت-العميق-deep-web">الطبقة الثانية: الإنترنت العميق (Deep Web)</h3>
<p>تخيل معي أننا ننشئ حساب واتساب على سبيل المثال. هنا، ندخل إلى شيء يسمى “الإنترنت العميق” (Deep Web). وهذا ليس جزءًا مخيفًا على الإطلاق كما يفهم الكثير من الناس؛ فالإنترنت العميق مختلف تمامًا عما يعتقده الكثيرون.</p>

<p>هذا هو الجزء غير الظاهر لعموم الناس. لماذا؟ لأنه يكون محميًا وغير متاح إلا لمن لديهم صلاحية معينة، أو بمعنى آخر، يتطلب الدخول إليه وجود حساب.</p>

<p><strong>أمثلة من استخداماتك اليومية للإنترنت العميق:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>البريد الإلكتروني:</strong> عندما تدخل على بريدك في جيميل.</li>
  <li><strong>الخدمات المصرفية:</strong> عندما تدخل على حسابك البنكي من خلال التطبيق.</li>
  <li><strong>المحادثات الخاصة:</strong> عندما تدخل إلى محادثاتك مع زملائك. هل يمكنك البحث عن هذه المحادثات على جوجل؟ بالطبع لا.</li>
</ul>

<p>كل هذا يحدث داخل الإنترنت العميق، وأنت تستخدمه كل يوم دون أن تشعر.</p>

<p><strong>أمثلة أخرى:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>الأنظمة الداخلية للشركات:</strong> الشركة التي تعمل بها لديها نظام داخلي يربط الموظفين من خلال محادثات وملفات وسجلات حضور وانصراف. هذا جزء من الإنترنت العميق لا يستطيع الوصول إليه سوى الموظفين، ولا يمكن لأي محرك بحث فهرسته.</li>
  <li><strong>مواقع الحجز والبيانات الحساسة:</strong> عندما تحجز تذكرة طيران أو تتصفح ملفات مرضى في مستشفى، هل تكون هذه المعلومات متاحة لأي شخص؟ لا.</li>
</ul>

<p>الإنترنت العميق ليس مرعبًا ولا خطيرًا، بل على العكس، هو أكثر جزء من الإنترنت فائدة.</p>

<h3 id="الطبقة-الثالثة-الإنترنت-المظلم-dark-net">الطبقة الثالثة: الإنترنت المظلم (Dark Net)</h3>
<p>نأتي الآن للجزء الذي يثير فضول الناس دائمًا: “الإنترنت المظلم” (Dark Net). وهذا بالفعل شيء مختلف تمامًا.</p>

<p>لا يمكنك الوصول إلى هذا الجزء من الإنترنت عبر أي متصفح عادي. فلو فتحت جوجل كروم أو موزيلا فايرفوكس وكتبت فيه اسم موقع من الإنترنت المظلم، لن يظهر لك. وحتى لو كتبت رابط الموقع مباشرة، فإنه لن يعمل.</p>

<p><strong>كيفية الوصول:</strong>
لكي تدخل إلى هذه المواقع، يجب أن تستخدم متصفحًا خاصًا، مثل متصفح <strong>Tor</strong>، الذي يخفي هويتك ويجعل اتصالك غير قابل للتتبع.</p>

<p>إذا رأيت رابطًا لأحد هذه المواقع، ستجد أن شكله غريب، لأن أسماء النطاقات تكون غالبًا عشوائية ولا تنتهي بـ <code class="highlighter-rouge">.com</code> أو <code class="highlighter-rouge">.net</code>، بل تنتهي بـ <strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">.onion</code></strong>. وقد تمت تسميتها كذلك لأن شبكة Tor تشبه البصلة في طريقة عملها، حيث توجد عدة طبقات من التشفير للوصول إلى المركز.</p>

<p><strong>ملاحظة:</strong>
من المستحيل تقريبًا الوصول إلى هوية منشئ أي موقع على الإنترنت المظلم.</p>

<p>والآن، دعنا نطرح سؤالاً: لماذا يوجد شيء يسمى “الإنترنت المظلم” من الأساس؟</p>

<h3 id="الاستخدامات-المشروعة-وغير-المشروعة-للإنترنت-المظلم">الاستخدامات المشروعة وغير المشروعة للإنترنت المظلم</h3>
<p>بدأ الأمر بفكرة نبيلة جدًا، وهي حماية الخصوصية.</p>

<p><strong>الاستخدامات الإيجابية (الجانب المشرق):</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>الحرية من الرقابة:</strong> يستخدمه الأشخاص الذين يعيشون في دول تفرض رقابة شديدة ويريدون التحدث بحرية.</li>
  <li><strong>حماية الصحفيين:</strong> يلجأ إليه الصحفيون للهروب من تتبع السلطات.</li>
  <li><strong>التصفح المجهول:</strong> يستخدمه أفراد يريدون تصفح الإنترنت دون أن يكشفوا عن هويتهم.</li>
</ul>

<p>يمكنك أن تجد مواقع مفيدة بشكل طبيعي، مثل مكتبات ضخمة تحتوي على كتب نادرة، أو منصات للنقاش السياسي والعلمي دون رقابة، أو حتى مواقع للبيع والشراء لا تتطلب منك تقديم بياناتك الشخصية.</p>

<p><strong>الاستخدامات السلبية (الجانب المظلم):</strong>
لكن للأسف، مع وجود هذه الحماية والخصوصية الشديدة، دخل أشخاص آخرون واستغلوا الإنترنت المظلم في أمور غير قانونية. توجد أسواق إلكترونية تبيع كل شيء ممنوع يمكن أن تتخيله، من المخدرات والأسلحة، وهناك منتديات لأشخاص يشاركون في أنشطة مثل:</p>
<ul>
  <li>اختراق الحسابات.</li>
  <li>بيع بيانات بطاقات ائتمان مسروقة.</li>
  <li>الاتجار بالأعضاء البشرية.</li>
  <li>بيع أطفال مخطوفين لأغراض إباحية، وهذا تجده بكثرة.</li>
  <li>وأشياء أخرى أكثر من ذلك بكثير.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="مخاطر-الإنترنت-المظلم">مخاطر الإنترنت المظلم</h3>
<p>هنا يأتي الخطر الحقيقي، ليس فقط بسبب المحتوى، ولكن أيضًا بسبب الأمان. في الإنترنت المظلم، لا توجد حماية كافية.</p>

<p><strong>المخاطر الأمنية:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>الفيروسات:</strong> يمكن بسهولة أن يرسل لك شخص ما رابطًا يحتوي على فيروس.</li>
  <li><strong>الاختراق:</strong> قد يتم اختراق جهازك.</li>
  <li><strong>المراقبة:</strong> قد تتم مراقبتك إذا لم تؤمن نفسك جيدًا.</li>
</ul>

<p>إذا دخلت إلى هناك وأنت لا تفهم ما تفعله، أو كان دافعك هو الفضول فقط، فقد تجد نفسك قد وقعت في فخ.</p>

<h3 id="نقطة-هامة-ونصيحة">نقطة هامة ونصيحة</h3>
<p>لكن يجب أن نوضح نقطة مهمة جدًا: مجرد الدخول على متصفح Tor أو حتى تصفح الإنترنت المظلم ليس جريمة في حد ذاته. الجريمة تبدأ عندما تشارك أو تتفاعل مع المحتوى غير القانوني.</p>

<p>لنتحدث بصراحة، هناك أشخاص دخلوا، ورأوا، ثم خرجوا دون أن يحدث لهم شيء. وهناك أشخاص آخرون دخلوا وبدأوا في الشراء والتعامل، وهنا بدأت المشكلة.</p>

<p><strong>نصيحة خالصة:</strong>
لا تبحث عن كيفية الدخول أو حتى مجرد التصفح العادي. لأن المشاهد بالداخل حقًا منها ما هو غير أخلاقي ومنها ما لن يعجبك، فهي سيئة جدًا. وهذا ليس مجرد كلام، بل هو نابع من تجربة شخصية.</p>

<h3 id="الخلاصة">الخلاصة</h3>
<p>المهم الآن هو أن تفهم لماذا صُنعت كل طبقة من طبقات الإنترنت:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>الإنترنت السطحي:</strong> سهل ومفتوح، ولكنه محدود.</li>
  <li><strong>الإنترنت العميق:</strong> ضخم ومفيد، ولكنه محمي.</li>
  <li><strong>الإنترنت المظلم:</strong> مليء بالحرية، ولكن يجب أن تدخله بإدراك ووعي تام.</li>
</ul>

<p>كل جزء له استخداماته وفوائده ومخاطره. والفرق ليس في المكان، بل فيما تفعله أنت بداخله. الإنترنت ليس مجرد صفحات تُفتح، بل هو عالم كبير، وهذا العالم يحتاج إلى وعي.</p>

<p>نلتقي في المقال القادم.</p>

            <p>في هذا المقال، سأستعرض مجموعة من الأدوات والأسرار التي ستفيدك كثيرًا في مجال تطوير الويب، حيث ستوفر عليك بعض الوقت وستنال إعجابك بكل تأكيد. لنبدأ باستعراض هذه الأدوات.</p>

<h3 id="1-موقع-carbon-لتحويل-الكود-إلى-صور-جذابة">1. موقع Carbon: لتحويل الكود إلى صور جذابة</h3>

<p>في كثير من الأحيان، قد تحتاج إلى عرض جزء من الكود في مقال تعليمي أو عند طرح استفسار تقني. توجد عدة مواقع تتيح لك تحويل الكود إلى صورة ذات مظهر احترافي لمشاركتها بسهولة. أحد أبرز هذه المواقع هو <strong>Carbon</strong>.</p>

<p>في موقع Carbon، تقوم بإضافة الكود الخاص بك، ثم تختار النسق (Theme) الذي تفضله من حيث الألوان والتصميم. يمنحك الموقع تحكمًا كاملًا في المحرر، حيث يمكنك تعديل حجم الخط، ارتفاع السطر، وغيرها من الخصائص، تمامًا كما لو كنت تستخدم محرر أكواد حقيقي.</p>

<p><strong>مثال للكود:</strong></p>
<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">greet</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">name</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">`Hello, </span><span class="p">${</span><span class="nx">name</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="s2">!`</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nx">greet</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="s1">World</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>بعد الانتهاء من التنسيق، يمكنك تصدير الصورة ومشاركتها.</p>

<h3 id="2-موقع-vzyio-لإنشاء-مواقع-الويب-بسهولة">2. موقع Vzy.io: لإنشاء مواقع الويب بسهولة</h3>

<p>أداة أخرى مميزة هي <strong>Vzy.io</strong> (المعروف سابقًا بـ Lafavle)، والتي تمكّنك من إنشاء موقع ويب باستخدام تقنيات متعددة بسهولة فائقة ومن خلال وصف نصي بسيط (prompt). هذه الأداة مفيدة بشكل خاص لغير المبرمجين الذين يرغبون في إنشاء موقع بسيط دون الحاجة لتعلم لغات البرمجة أو التصميم.</p>

<p>بمجرد إدخال وصف نصي بسيط للموقع الذي تريده، يقوم الموقع بتحليل الفكرة وإنشاء جميع الملفات اللازمة. يمكنك أيضًا تحديد التقنيات التي تفضل استخدامها. والنتيجة هي موقع كامل وجاهز للتصفح.</p>

<h3 id="3-موقع-mockaroo-لتوليد-بيانات-وهمية">3. موقع Mockaroo: لتوليد بيانات وهمية</h3>

<p>عند تطوير التطبيقات، نحتاج غالبًا إلى بيانات وهمية (dummy data) لاختبار وظائف التطبيق. موقع <strong>Mockaroo</strong> يحل هذه المشكلة، حيث يمكنك تحديد الحقول التي تحتاجها في قاعدة بياناتك، وسيقوم الموقع بتوليد ملف يحتوي على هذه البيانات.</p>

<p>يدعم الموقع إنشاء ملفات بصيغ متعددة مثل JSON، CSV، وغيرها. يمكنك تحديد الحقول يدويًا أو الطلب من الذكاء الاصطناعي اقتراح حقول بناءً على وصف تطبيقك. بعد تحديد عدد السجلات المطلوبة ونوع الملف، يقوم الموقع بتوليد البيانات التي يمكنك استخدامها كواجهة برمجة تطبيقات وهمية (Fake API) لاختبار تطبيقك.</p>

<p><strong>مثال لملف JSON تم توليده:</strong></p>
<div class="language-json highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">[</span><span class="w">
  </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">
    </span><span class="nl">"id"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w">

</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="4-موقع-devdocs-للوصول-إلى-التوثيقات-بدون-إنترنت">4. موقع DevDocs: للوصول إلى التوثيقات بدون إنترنت</h3>

<p>كثيرًا ما نحتاج إلى مراجعة توثيقات لغات البرمجة والتقنيات المختلفة أثناء العمل، وقد لا يكون الاتصال بالإنترنت متاحًا دائمًا. موقع <strong>DevDocs</strong> يقدم حلاً رائعًا لهذه المشكلة.</p>

<p>يتيح لك الموقع تصفح وتحميل توثيقات (Documentation) معظم لغات وتقنيات الويب. بعد تحميل التوثيقات التي تحتاجها، يمكنك الوصول إليها في أي وقت من خلال الرابط <code class="highlighter-rouge">devdocs.io/offline</code> دون الحاجة إلى اتصال بالإنترنت، مما يجعله أداة مثالية للتعلم والمراجعة في أي مكان.</p>

<h3 id="5-موقع-virustotal-لفحص-الملفات-والروابط-المشبوهة">5. موقع VirusTotal: لفحص الملفات والروابط المشبوهة</h3>

<p>قد تصلنا أحيانًا ملفات أو روابط عبر البريد الإلكتروني نشك في سلامتها. موقع <strong>VirusTotal</strong> هو أداة أساسية لفحص الملفات والروابط (URLs) التي تشك بها.</p>

<p>يمكنك رفع ملف أو إدخال رابط، وسيقوم الموقع بفحصه باستخدام عدد كبير من محركات مكافحة الفيروسات والبرمجيات الخبيثة. يعطيك الموقع تقريرًا مفصلاً يوضح ما إذا كان الملف أو الرابط آمنًا أم لا، مما يساعدك على تجنب المخاطر الأمنية.</p>

<h3 id="6-موقع-bundlephobia-لتحليل-حجم-حزم-npm">6. موقع BundlePhobia: لتحليل حجم حزم npm</h3>

<p>حجم الحزم (packages) التي نستخدمها في مشاريعنا يؤثر بشكل مباشر على أداء الموقع. موقع <strong>BundlePhobia</strong> يساعدك على تحليل حجم أي حزمة npm.</p>

<p>بمجرد إدخال اسم الحزمة، يعطيك الموقع تقريرًا مفصلاً عن حجمها (مضغوطة وغير مضغوطة) والوقت المتوقع لتحميلها بسرعات اتصال مختلفة. الميزة الأهم هي إمكانية رفع ملف <code class="highlighter-rouge">package.json</code> الخاص بمشروعك، ليقوم الموقع بتحليل جميع الحزم المستخدمة وتقديم تقرير شامل. هذه المعلومات تساعدك على اتخاذ قرارات أفضل بشأن الحزم التي تستخدمها والبحث عن بدائل أخف إذا لزم الأمر.</p>

<h3 id="7-موقع-explain-shell-لشرح-أوامر-سطر-الأوامر">7. موقع Explain Shell: لشرح أوامر سطر الأوامر</h3>

<p>قد نصادف أوامر معقدة في سطر الأوامر (Command Line) ولا نفهم وظيفتها بالكامل. موقع <strong>Explain Shell</strong> هو أداة ممتازة تقوم بشرح أي أمر بالتفصيل.</p>

<p>كل ما عليك هو إدخال الأمر كاملاً مع معاملاته (parameters)، وسيقوم الموقع بتجزئته وشرح وظيفة كل جزء على حدة. كما يوفر روابط للتوثيق الرسمي الخاص بالأمر لمزيد من التفاصيل.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>على سبيل المثال، عند إدخال الأمر <code class="highlighter-rouge">ls -lha</code>، سيشرح الموقع أن:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">ls</code>: هو الأمر الخاص بعرض محتويات المجلد.</li>
    <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">-l</code>: تعني عرض النتائج بصيغة القائمة الطويلة (long listing format).</li>
    <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">-h</code>: تعني عرض حجم الملفات بصيغة سهلة القراءة (human-readable).</li>
    <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">-a</code>: تعني عرض جميع الملفات، بما في ذلك الملفات المخفية.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="8-موقع-perf-buddy-لتحليل-أداء-المواقع">8. موقع Perf Buddy: لتحليل أداء المواقع</h3>

<p>أداء الموقع هو عامل حاسم لنجاحه. موقع <strong>Perf Buddy</strong> هو أداة بسيطة تقوم بتحليل أداء موقعك وتقدم تقريرًا شاملاً.</p>

<p>تقوم بإدخال رابط موقعك، وبعد بضع دقائق من التحليل، يقدم لك الموقع تقريرًا مفصلاً عن الأداء على أجهزة سطح المكتب والهواتف المحمولة. يرسل التقرير أيضًا إلى بريدك الإلكتروني. يمكنك استخدام هذا التقرير لتحديد نقاط الضعف في موقعك والعمل على تحسينها.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>ملاحظة:</strong> قد تتأثر نتائج الأداء بعوامل خارجية مثل الإعلانات التي يتم حقنها في الصفحة، والتي قد لا تكون تحت سيطرتك المباشرة.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="9-أداة-lighthouse-لتحليل-شامل-من-المتصفح">9. أداة Lighthouse: لتحليل شامل من المتصفح</h3>

<p>بشكل مشابه لـ Perf Buddy، توجد أداة مدمجة في متصفحات كروم تسمى <strong>Lighthouse</strong>. الميزة هنا أنك لست بحاجة لزيارة أي موقع خارجي.</p>

<p>يمكنك الوصول إليها من خلال أدوات المطور (Inspect)، ومن ثم اختيار Lighthouse. تقوم الأداة بتوليد تقرير شامل لا يقتصر على الأداء (Performance) فقط، بل يشمل أيضًا إمكانية الوصول (Accessibility)، وأفضل الممارسات (Best Practices)، وتحسين محركات البحث (SEO).</p>

<p>أحد أفضل جوانب تقرير Lighthouse هو أنه يقدم اقتراحات قابلة للتنفيذ. لكل مشكلة يجدها، يوفر رابطًا لمقالات تشرح كيفية حلها، مما يساعدك على تحسين موقعك بشكل فعال.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>تجدر الإشارة إلى أن أدوات مثل Lighthouse، GTmetrix، و Perf Buddy غالبًا ما تقدم نتائج متقاربة ولكن في تقارير ذات أشكال مختلفة.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="10-موقع-regex101-لفهم-واختبار-التعابير-النمطية">10. موقع Regex101: لفهم واختبار التعابير النمطية</h3>

<p>التعابير النمطية (Regular Expressions) قد تكون مربكة وصعبة الفهم. موقع <strong>Regex101</strong> هو الأداة المثالية للتعامل معها.</p>

<p>عندما تضع تعبيرًا نمطيًا في الموقع، فإنه يقوم بتجزئته وشرح كل جزء منه بالتفصيل. بالإضافة إلى ذلك، يمكنك اختبار التعبير على نصوص مختلفة (Test String) لترى ما إذا كان يطابقها أم لا. هذه الميزة مفيدة جدًا للتأكد من أن التعبير النمطي الذي كتبته أو نسخته يؤدي الغرض المطلوب بشكل صحيح.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>على سبيل المثال، يمكنك وضع تعبير نمطي مخصص للتحقق من صحة البريد الإلكتروني، ثم إدخال عناوين بريد إلكتروني مختلفة في خانة الاختبار لترى النتيجة فورًا.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>وبهذا نكون قد استعرضنا عشر أدوات مفيدة يمكن أن تساعد في تسهيل عمل مطوري الويب. آمل أن يكون هذا المقال قد نال إعجابكم وأن تكون هذه الأدوات نافعة لكم. إذا وجدتم هذا المحتوى مفيدًا وترغبون في جزء ثانٍ، يمكنكم ذكر ذلك في التعليقات.</p>

          <p class="text-base-content">
            <p>مرحبًا بكم. هذا نموذج ذكاء اصطناعي، ولكنه ليس أي نموذج ذكاء اصطناعي عادي، هذا نموذج ذكاء اصطناعي خاص بي وحدي. لقد علمته ودربته ليكون بمثابة محامٍ، أزوده بملفات قضايا وهو يجيبني على أسئلة متخصصة جدًا بناءً على القضية التي لديه.</p>

<p>يستخدم الكثير من الناس “شات جي بي تي” أو نماذج الذكاء الاصطناعي المتاحة حاليًا، ويحصلون منها على الردود التي يحتاجونها. ولكن ماذا لو أردت أن أجعل الذكاء الاصطناعي يجيبني بردود متخصصة بالفعل في مجال معين؟</p>

<p>أول ما سيتبادر إلى ذهنك هو بناء نموذج خاص بك. ولكن المشكلة هي أنك لكي تبني نموذجًا قويًا مثل “شات جي بي تي”، فإنك ستحتاج إلى إنفاق ملايين الدولارات حرفيًا، ناهيك عن الوقت والجهد المبذول لإنتاج شيء كهذا. إذًا، ما الحل؟ هذا هو موضوع مقال اليوم.</p>

<h3 id="لماذا-لا-نبني-نموذجًا-من-الصفر">لماذا لا نبني نموذجًا من الصفر؟</h3>

<p>لندخل في صلب موضوع المقال مباشرة، وهو كيفية بناء نموذج ذكاء اصطناعي خاص بك، قادر على تقديم إجابات متخصصة في مجال معين أنت من يحدده.</p>

<p><strong>مقدمة لا غنى عنها:</strong> قبل الخوض في الشرح العملي، من الضروري فهم السياق النظري، فتخطي هذه المقدمة قد يفوتك معلومات أساسية لفهم الخطوات التالية.</p>

<p>لكي تبني نموذجًا من الصفر، فأنت بحاجة لتعلم ما يسمى بـ “معالجة اللغات الطبيعية” (NLP)، ناهيك عن مقدمة في تعلم الآلة والذكاء الاصطناعي التي تحتاج إلى تعلمها أولاً، بالإضافة إلى الرياضيات، وحساب التفاضل والتكامل، والإحصاء، وغيرها من العلوم ذات الصلة.</p>

<p>لنفترض أنك درست كل هذه العلوم وأصبحت متمكنًا منها تمامًا. هل ستكون قادرًا على بناء نموذج يقدم إجابات قوية جدًا مثل “شات جي بي تي” أو “جيمناي” أو النماذج الموجودة حاليًا، بل وأكثر من ذلك، متخصص في مجال معين؟ الإجابة هي نعم ولا.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>نعم،</strong> لأنك تعلمت العلوم اللازمة التي تمكنك من بناء هذا النموذج.</li>
  <li><strong>ولكن لا،</strong> لأنك لا تملك الميزانية الكافية لشراء الموارد (Resources)، حيث تحتاج إلى أجهزة، وبطاقات رسومية، وبناء بيئة متكاملة تؤهلك لإنتاج نموذج قوي جدًا.</li>
</ul>

<p>فالمسألة ليست مجرد مهارة تقنية، بل هي معادلة ذات طرفين: مهارة تقنية وتمويل. فإذا وفرت العلم التقني، فسينقصك التمويل، لأنك ستحتاج لبناء نموذج مُدرَّب على ملايين بل مليارات من البيانات التي جمعتها من مصادر متعددة.</p>

<h3 id="الحل-تبني-وتدريب-نموذج-موجود">الحل: تبني وتدريب نموذج موجود</h3>

<p>الآن قد تقول: “إذًا، هل يعني هذا أنني لا أستطيع بناء نموذج؟ لقد أثرت حماسنا ثم أوضحت أن الأمر معقد”. لا، أقول لك إن الأمر اختلف عن الماضي. الآن لدينا النماذج اللغوية الكبيرة (Large Language Models) مثل “شات جي بي تي” وعلم الذكاء الاصطناعي التوليدي الذي دخلناه الآن، وأصبح الأمر أسهل بكثير من ذي قبل.</p>

<p>فكرتنا إذن هي أننا لن نبني نموذجًا من الصفر، بل سنأخذ نموذجًا موجودًا ونتبناه، ونبدأ في تدريبه ليتخصص في مجال معين.</p>

<p>لدينا نوعان من النماذج:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>النماذج مغلقة الوصول (Closed Access Models):</strong> هذه مثل “شات جي بي تي” و”جيمناي” والنماذج القوية جدًا التي نراها. هذه نماذج لا يمكن أخذ شيفرتها المصدرية أو التغيير فيها أو تعديلها أو تدريبها، لأن أصحابها يعتبرونها عملاً تجاريًا لهم. إذا لاحظت، فإن “شات جي بي تي” يتطلب اشتراكًا شهريًا مدفوعًا ويقدم لك أداءً قويًا جدًا يمكنك الاعتماد عليه.</li>
  <li><strong>النماذج مفتوحة المصدر (Open Access Models):</strong> في المقابل، لدينا نماذج مفتوحة المصدر مثل Llama, Qwen, Mistral, DeepSeek، وغيرها من النماذج التي ظهرت لاحقًا.</li>
</ul>

<p>لذا، بدلاً من بناء نموذج من الصفر وفي النهاية يكون ضعيفًا وعديم الفائدة، سآخذ نموذجًا مفتوح الوصول - كأنني أتبنى طفلاً - وأبدأ في إعطائه البيانات وتغذيته وتعليمه. وهو سيجيبني بإجابات عبقرية جدًا لأنني علمته المزيد والمزيد وجعلته متخصصًا في مجال معين. وهذا ما سنفعله في شرح اليوم.</p>

<p>لقد قررت العمل على نموذج Llama 3، ولكن يمكنك اختيار أي نموذج آخر مفتوح المصدر. سنستخدم مكتبة (library) تسمى <code class="highlighter-rouge">Unsloth</code>. سنستدعي هذه المكتبة باستخدام لغة بايثون وسنبدأ بكتابة شيفرات برمجية قصيرة جدًا تمكننا من عملية تدريب النموذج، أو ما يسمى بعملية <strong>“الضبط الدقيق” (Fine-tuning)</strong>. لنركز على هذا المصطلح جيدًا.</p>

<h3 id="الخطوة-الأولى-إعداد-البيانات-dataset">الخطوة الأولى: إعداد البيانات (Dataset)</h3>
<p>أولاً، أنت بحاجة للبحث عن مجموعة بيانات (Dataset) لتدريب نموذجك عليها. فإذا كنت صاحب شركة أو عمل تجاري، فمن المحتمل أن يكون لديك بالفعل ملفات Excel، أو Word، أو JSON، أو أي نوع آخر من الملفات. كل هذه الملفات يمكنك تغذيتها للنموذج مفتوح المصدر وتدريبه ليكون متخصصًا في مجالك.</p>

<p><strong>ملاحظة مهمة:</strong> من الضروري التأكد من صحة البيانات التي ستغذي بها النموذج. فلا يصح مثلاً أن تغذي نموذجًا ببيانات تتعلق بالهندسة، وتجد في وسط جداولك بيانات عن مرضى السكري أو القلب. لا يجب أن تحتوي بياناتك على قيم شاذة (Outliers) أو مشكلات، لأن هذه المشكلات ستظهر في إجابات النموذج لاحقًا، وستجد أن نموذجك “يهلوس” ويقدم إجابات غير دقيقة.</p>

<p>نصيحتي لك هي التأكد من أن بياناتك مرتبة جيدًا ولا تحتوي على أي شيء خارج عن التخصص الذي تريد تدريب نموذجك عليه. في حالة هذا المقال، سأستخدم مجموعة بيانات جاهزة تحتوي على أسئلة في القانون والقضاء. سأحصل على هذه البيانات من موقع Hugging Face.</p>

<h3 id="الخطوة-الثانية-إعداد-بيئة-العمل-google-colab">الخطوة الثانية: إعداد بيئة العمل (Google Colab)</h3>
<p>أمر آخر مهم هو أننا لكي نجري عملية الضبط الدقيق وتنجح بشكل ممتاز، فإننا نحتاج إلى جهاز ذي مواصفات قوية. إذًا، ما الحل إذا كان جهازي متواضعًا أو لا يحتوي على موارد عالية وبطاقة رسومية وذاكرة وصول عشوائي (RAM) كبيرة؟ سنتجه لاستخدام منصة <strong>Google Colab</strong>.</p>

<p>منصة Google Colab تمكننا جوجل من خلالها من الحصول على موارد سحابية قوية مثل معالج، وبطاقة رسومية، وذاكرة وصول عشوائي، ومساحة تخزين، كل ذلك على شكل سحابة (Cloud). أي أنه ليس جهاز الكمبيوتر الخاص بك، بل هو جهاز سحابي. هذا الجهاز يمكنك من كتابة شيفرة بايثون وتشغيلها تلقائيًا داخل ما يسمى بـ “دفتر الملاحظات” (Notebook).</p>

<p>إذًا، لنبدأ الشرح العملي بالانتقال إلى Google Colab. بعد فتحه، اضغط على زر “New notebook” لإنشاء دفتر ملاحظات جديد لكتابة الشيفرة الخاصة بك.</p>

<p>عندما يفتح دفتر الملاحظات، سيكون يعمل باستخدام المعالج فقط (CPU). لتفعيل بطاقة الرسوميات (GPU)، اتبع الخطوات التالية:</p>
<ol>
  <li>انقر على السهم بجانب كلمة <code class="highlighter-rouge">Connect</code>.</li>
  <li>اختر <code class="highlighter-rouge">Change runtime type</code>.</li>
  <li>اختر <code class="highlighter-rouge">T4 GPU</code> من القائمة المنسدلة.</li>
  <li>انقر على <code class="highlighter-rouge">Save</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>بهذا نكون جاهزين لبدء عملية الضبط الدقيق.</p>

<h3 id="الخطوة-الثالثة-التنفيذ-العملي-كتابة-الشيفرة">الخطوة الثالثة: التنفيذ العملي (كتابة الشيفرة)</h3>
<p>لقد اخترت إجراء الضبط الدقيق لنموذج <code class="highlighter-rouge">Llama-3.1-8B</code>. يمكنك اختيار أي نموذج آخر مفتوح المصدر مثل <code class="highlighter-rouge">Qwen</code> أو <code class="highlighter-rouge">Mistral</code>، ولكن تأكد من أنه مدعوم من مكتبة <code class="highlighter-rouge">Unsloth</code>.</p>

<p><strong>1. تثبيت المكتبات:</strong>
أولاً، ضع مؤشر الكتابة في أول خلية شيفرة واكتب أمر التثبيت التالي، ثم انقر على أيقونة التشغيل (أو اضغط <code class="highlighter-rouge">Ctrl + Enter</code>) لتشغيله.</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># امر التثبيت هنا</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>2. تحميل النموذج:</strong>
بعد ذلك، أنشئ خلية جديدة وأضف الشيفرة التالية. سأشرح أهم الأجزاء باختصار:</p>
<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># الكود هنا
</span><span class="n">model_name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">"unsloth/llama-3.1-8b-Instruct-bnb-4bit"</span>
<span class="n">max_seq_length</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">2048</span>
<span class="n">load_in_4bit</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">True</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">model_name</code>: هنا نحدد النموذج الذي نريد تدريبه. في حالتي، اخترت <code class="highlighter-rouge">Llama-3.1-8B</code>، ولكن يمكنك اختيار غيره.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">max_seq_length</code>: هنا نحدد أقصى طول للتسلسل ليكون <code class="highlighter-rouge">2048</code> “توكن” (Token).
    <ul>
      <li><strong>ما هي التوكنز (Tokens)؟</strong> التوكنز تحدد طول استجابة النموذج وقدرته على كتابة النصوص. كلما زاد الرقم، حصلت على ردود أطول، ولكن هذا يزيد من وقت التدريب وقد يسبب مشكلات إذا لم يتم التعامل معه بشكل صحيح. قيمة <code class="highlighter-rouge">2048</code> أكثر من كافية لمعظم الاحتياجات. الذكاء الاصطناعي لا يقرأ الكلمات أو الحروف مباشرة، بل يتعامل مع “التوكنز”، حيث يكون لكل توكن معرف فريد (Token ID). قد يمثل التوكن كلمة كاملة، أو جزءًا من كلمة، أو حتى حرفًا واحدًا.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">load_in_4bit</code>: سنجعل قيمتها <code class="highlighter-rouge">True</code> لتقليل استهلاك الذاكرة.</li>
</ul>

<p>بمجرد تشغيل الشيفرة، ستلاحظ عرض رسم لحيوان الكسلان (Sloth) مع شريط تقدم. عندما يصل الشريط إلى 100%، فهذا يعني أن النموذج قد تم تحميله بنجاح. (اسم المكتبة <code class="highlighter-rouge">Unsloth</code> مستوحى من هذا الحيوان).</p>

<p><strong>3. تحديد معدل الضبط الدقيق (LoRA Adapter):</strong>
الخطوة التالية هي تحديد معدل الضبط الدقيق باستخدام ما يسمى بـ <strong>LoRA Adapter</strong>. هدفنا هنا هو إعادة تدريب جزء صغير فقط من النموذج (5-10%) وليس النموذج بأكمله. انسخ الشيفرة الجاهزة من <code class="highlighter-rouge">Unsloth</code> والصقها في خلية جديدة ثم قم بتشغيلها.</p>

<p><strong>لماذا نستخدم LoRA؟</strong>
إذا لم نقم بهذه الخطوة، سيقوم النموذج بإعادة تدريب نفسه بالكامل، مما سيكلفنا وقتًا وموارد ضخمة، خاصة وأننا نستخدم Google Colab المجاني الذي يوفر موارد محدودة. لذا، إعادة تدريب 5-10% فقط هي أكثر من كافية لإنتاج نموذج جيد.</p>

<h3 id="الخطوة-الرابعة-تجهيز-مجموعة-البيانات-dataset">الخطوة الرابعة: تجهيز مجموعة البيانات (Dataset)</h3>
<p>هذه هي الخطوة الأكثر أهمية. لكل مجموعة بيانات شكلها الخاص، فقد تكون في أعمدة، أو نصوص، أو ملفات وورد، إلخ. يجب علينا تهيئة هذه البيانات لتكون مفهومة للنموذج الذي سنقوم بتدريبه.</p>

<p><strong>فهم تنسيقات البيانات:</strong>
كل نموذج يفهم تنسيقًا معينًا من البيانات. على سبيل المثال:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>ChatML:</strong> هو التنسيق الذي يفهمه <code class="highlighter-rouge">ChatGPT</code>، ويعتمد على بنية <code class="highlighter-rouge">مفتاح: قيمة</code> (key: value).</li>
  <li><strong>Alpaca Format:</strong> هو التنسيق الذي تفهمه نماذج مثل <code class="highlighter-rouge">Llama</code> (الذي نستخدمه).</li>
</ul>

<p>بما أننا نستخدم نموذج <code class="highlighter-rouge">Llama</code>، يجب أن نهيئ بياناتنا القانونية لتتوافق مع تنسيق <strong>Alpaca</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>بنية تنسيق Alpaca:</strong>
يتكون تنسيق Alpaca من الحقول التالية:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">instruction</code>: التعليمات أو سياق المشكلة (ماذا تريد من النموذج أن يفعل).</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">input</code>: المدخل أو السؤال المحدد الذي تطرحه.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">response</code>: الإجابة أو الرد الذي يجب أن يقدمه النموذج.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">explanation</code>: (اختياري) شرح للسبب وراء الإجابة المقدمة.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>ربط بياناتنا بتنسيق Alpaca:</strong>
مهمتنا هي ربط أعمدة مجموعة البيانات الخاصة بنا بحقول Alpaca. في حالة مجموعة البيانات القانونية التي سأستخدمها من Hugging Face، أجد فيها ثلاثة أعمدة: <code class="highlighter-rouge">question</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">response</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">reasoning</code>.</p>
<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">question</code> -&gt; سيتم ربطه بـ <code class="highlighter-rouge">input</code>.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">response</code> -&gt; سيتم ربطه بـ <code class="highlighter-rouge">response</code> (تطابق الأسماء هنا مجرد صدفة).</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">reasoning</code> -&gt; سيتم ربطه بـ <code class="highlighter-rouge">explanation</code>.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">instruction</code> -&gt; سأقوم بتعيين تعليمة ثابتة: “Answer the legal question based on the reasoning provided in your answer”. يمكنك أيضًا ربطها بعمود متغير من بياناتك.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>تنفيذ تهيئة البيانات:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>في خلية جديدة، سنستخدم دالة <code class="highlighter-rouge">load_dataset</code> من مكتبة <code class="highlighter-rouge">datasets</code> لتحميل بياناتنا. في هذا المثال، سأضع رابط مجموعة البيانات من Hugging Face. يمكنك بدلاً من ذلك توفير مسار ملف Excel أو أي ملف آخر على جهازك.</li>
  <li>السطر التالي في الشيفرة سيقوم بربط الأعمدة بالحقول الصحيحة في تنسيق Alpaca. هذا السطر ضروري جدًا.</li>
  <li>قم بتشغيل الخلية.</li>
  <li>في خلية أخرى، يمكننا طباعة عينة من مجموعة البيانات للتأكد من أن عملية الربط تمت بشكل صحيح.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="الخطوة-الخامسة-تدريب-النموذج-fine-tuning">الخطوة الخامسة: تدريب النموذج (Fine-tuning)</h3>
<p>والآن وصلنا إلى الخطوة الخامسة والأخيرة: عملية الضبط الدقيق الفعلية. سنستخدم مُدرِّبًا يسمى <code class="highlighter-rouge">SFTTrainer</code> (Supervised Fine-tuning Trainer) من خلال بضعة أسطر بسيطة من الشيفرة.</p>

<p>أحضر الشيفرة وضعها في خلية جديدة. هناك العديد من المعلمات (Parameters)، ولكن من أهمها:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">max_steps</code>: تحدد عدد خطوات التدريب. كلما زاد العدد، زاد وقت التدريب وتم تدريب طبقات (layers) أكثر، مما يؤدي إلى نموذج أفضل، ولكنه يستهلك موارد أكثر.</li>
</ul>

<p>قم بتشغيل الشيفرة. ستلاحظ أنه يبدأ في العد وعرض جداول خاصة بالتدريب. تجاهلها وانتظره حتى ينتهي، فقد يستغرق بعض الوقت. عندما ينتهي، ستظهر رسالة تفيد بنجاح تدريب النموذج (<code class="highlighter-rouge">Model trained successfully</code>).</p>

<h3 id="الخطوة-السادسة-حفظ-النموذج-ومشاركته">الخطوة السادسة: حفظ النموذج ومشاركته</h3>
<p><strong>1. الحفظ المحلي (اختياري):</strong>
يمكنك كتابة شيفرة لحفظ النموذج محليًا لاستخدامه مع Ollama. تتضمن هذه الشيفرة تحديد <code class="highlighter-rouge">quantization_method</code> (طريقة التكميم)، وهي تقنية متقدمة لضغط النموذج. طرق مثل <code class="highlighter-rouge">f16</code> أو <code class="highlighter-rouge">q4</code> تؤثر على حجم النموذج النهائي وأدائه. على سبيل المثال، <code class="highlighter-rouge">f16</code> قد ينتج نموذجًا بحجم 16 جيجابايت. سنستخدم <code class="highlighter-rouge">f16</code> في هذا المثال.</p>

<p><strong>2. الرفع على Hugging Face (مستحسن):</strong>
بدلاً من الحفظ المحلي، الخيار الأفضل هو مشاركة النموذج مع الآخرين. لذا، سنقوم برفعه على منصة Hugging Face.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>إنشاء مستودع (Repository):</strong>
    <ol>
      <li>أنشئ حسابًا على Hugging Face.</li>
      <li>بعد تسجيل الدخول، انقر على صورة ملفك الشخصي واختر <code class="highlighter-rouge">New model</code>.</li>
      <li>أعطِ النموذج اسمًا ثم انقر على <code class="highlighter-rouge">Create model</code>.
بهذا تكون قد أنشأت مستودعًا جديدًا، ولكنه فارغ حاليًا.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><strong>الحصول على توكن الوصول (Access Token):</strong>
    <ol>
      <li>من Google Colab، سنحتاج إلى توكن للوصول إلى حسابك في Hugging Face.</li>
      <li>في موقع Hugging Face، انقر على صورة ملفك الشخصي مجددًا، ثم اختر <code class="highlighter-rouge">Settings</code>.</li>
      <li>اذهب إلى <code class="highlighter-rouge">Access Tokens</code>.</li>
      <li>انقر على <code class="highlighter-rouge">New token</code>، وامنحه صلاحيات القراءة (<code class="highlighter-rouge">Read</code>) والكتابة (<code class="highlighter-rouge">Write</code>)، ثم أنشئ التوكن.
<strong>تحذير:</strong> التوكن الذي تم إنشاؤه سري للغاية. لا تشاركه مع أي شخص، لأنه يمنح وصولاً كاملاً إلى حسابك.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><strong>رفع النموذج:</strong>
    <ol>
      <li>انسخ التوكن.</li>
      <li>عد إلى Google Colab، وأنشئ خلية جديدة، واكتب الشيفرة اللازمة لرفع النموذج، والصق التوكن الخاص بك في المكان المخصص.</li>
      <li>قم بتشغيل الخلية. سيبدأ النموذج بالرفع تلقائيًا إلى Hugging Face.</li>
      <li>بعد انتهاء عملية الرفع، إذا قمت بتحديث صفحة المستودع على Hugging Face، ستجد ملفات النموذج قد ظهرت.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="الخطوة-السابعة-استخدام-النموذج-المُدرَّب">الخطوة السابعة: استخدام النموذج المُدرَّب</h3>
<p>الآن بعد أن أصبح النموذج متاحًا على Hugging Face، يمكن لأي شخص استخدامه عبر Ollama. ببساطة، افتح واجهة سطر الأوامر (CMD) واكتب الأمر التالي، مع استبدال <code class="highlighter-rouge">your-username/your-model-name</code> بالمسار الفعلي لنموذجك على Hugging Face:</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ollama run your-username/your-model-name
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>بهذا يمكن للمستخدمين التفاعل مع نموذجك المتخصص.</p>

<p><strong>نصيحة:</strong> للحصول على واجهة مستخدم رسومية شبيهة بـ ChatGPT بدلاً من سطر الأوامر، يمكنك استخدام أدوات مثل <code class="highlighter-rouge">Open WebUI</code> مع Ollama.</p>

<h3 id="اختبار-النتائج-قبل-وبعد">اختبار النتائج: قبل وبعد</h3>
<p>للتأكد من نجاح العملية، قمت بإجراء مقارنة:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>قبل التدريب:</strong> سألت نموذج <code class="highlighter-rouge">Llama-3.1-8B</code> الأصلي سؤالاً قانونيًا. كانت إجابته أنه غير قادر على المساعدة في المسائل القانونية.</li>
  <li><strong>بعد التدريب:</strong> سألت نموذجي المُدرَّب (المستضاف على Hugging Face) نفس السؤال. قدم النموذج إجابة متخصصة ودقيقة.</li>
</ol>

<p>هذا يثبت أن عملية الضبط الدقيق قد نجحت.</p>

<p><strong>ملاحظة أخيرة:</strong>
لن يكون النموذج مثاليًا من أول عملية ضبط دقيق. للحصول على نتائج أفضل، ستحتاج إلى تغذيته ببيانات أكثر تنوعًا (ضمن نفس التخصص)، وربما زيادة عدد خطوات التدريب (<code class="highlighter-rouge">max_steps</code>).</p>

<h3 id="خاتمة-وإمكانيات-مستقبلية">خاتمة وإمكانيات مستقبلية</h3>
<p>في هذا المقال، تعلمنا كيفية إجراء ضبط دقيق لنموذج لغوي مفتوح المصدر لجعله متخصصًا في مجال معين، مثل القانون. يمكنك تطبيق نفس المفهوم على أي مجال آخر: الهندسة، الطب، الفن، إلخ.
الآن أصبح النموذج خاصًا بك بالكامل. يمكنك تطوير هذه الفكرة إلى ما هو أبعد، مثل إنشاء “شات بوت” (Chatbot) متخصص لخدمة العملاء على موقعك، قادر على الرد على استفساراتهم بدقة وكفاءة. الإمكانيات واسعة بعد تعلمك لأساسيات عملية الضبط الدقيق.</p>

            <p>اليوم، مع ظهور V0 وأدوات الذكاء الاصطناعي وتقدمها المذهل، ما الذي يميز V0 عن LLaVA وFirebase Studio من ناحية النموذج اللغوي الكبير (LLM)؟ التحدي الكبير اليوم الذي يحاول الجميع الفوز بسباقه هو أن يصبح النموذج اللغوي الكبير ذكياً بما يكفي ليقدم لك نتائج دقيقة.</p>

<p>اليوم، يقع التحدي عليك كمستخدم يتعامل مع هذا النموذج، أياً كانت العلامة التجارية التي يتبعها، فذلك لا يهم الآن. التحدي هو أن تكتب الأمر (Prompt) السليم، الصحيح، والدقيق الذي يحتوي على كل أنواع التفاصيل الممكنة، وتعريف الأدوار (Role Definition)، وأن تزوده بالسياق الذي سيعمل فيه، والتكنولوجيا المحددة، والحزمة (Package) والمكتبات (Libraries) التي سيستخدمها. إذا لم تفعل ذلك بشكل سليم، فغالباً ما ستكون النتائج التي ستحصل عليها بعيدة عن المطلوب. لنتفق على هذا مبدئياً. هذا بالطبع هو فكر هندسة الأوامر (Prompt Engineering).</p>

<h3 id="نهج-v0-الفريد">نهج V0 الفريد</h3>

<p>ولكي يتمكنوا من تحسين النموذج، يتوقعون منك أن تحسن طريقتك في كتابة الأوامر. لكن V0، بصراحة، يتبنى فكرة في اتجاه مختلف تماماً، أشعر أنه في معادلة خاصة به. إنه يركز على حزمة تقنية (Tech Stack) محددة، حديثة، وجذابة، وهي:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">Next.js</code></li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">Tailwind CSS</code></li>
  <li>مكونات جاهزة من مكتبة <code class="highlighter-rouge">Shadcn UI</code> (المبنية على <code class="highlighter-rouge">Radix UI</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>لقد أخذ كل هذه المجموعة وركز على بناء نماذج احترافية تتمحور حول هذه الحزمة التقنية فقط.</p>

<p>في الواقع، V0 موجود منذ فترة طويلة، وكان لديه نظام عام جداً في إنشاء التطبيقات التي ينتجها. وقد نشرنا مقالاً سابقاً تحدثنا فيه عن قدرة V0 على إنشاء واجهات أمامية (Frontend). لكنهم مؤخراً أطلقوا نموذجهم اللغوي الكبير الخاص بهم والذي يركز على هذه الحزم التقنية تحديداً. قدرة هذا النموذج تكمن في أنه يستطيع، بأمر بسيط جداً، مثل أن تطلب منه بناء موقع للتجارة الإلكترونية، أن يبدأ في إضافة الأنماط والأشكال والألوان.</p>

<p>أود أن أقول إنني أكتب الأمر بطريقة تركز على جانب العمل (Business). على سبيل المثال، أقول له: “أريدك أن تبني لي موقعاً للتجارة الإلكترونية”. وقد قمنا بتجربة في مقال سابق حيث طلبت منه: “أنشئ لي هذا الموقع التجاري، واجعل كل الأفكار التي تنفذها مستقبلية الطابع والألوان”. بصراحة، النتيجة التي قدمها كانت رائعة. لم أكن أتخيل أنه بأمر بسيط كهذا يمكنه إنتاج هذه الأشكال والألوان. اطلب منه إنشاء مظهر داكن (Dark Theme)، دعم اللغتين العربية والإنجليزية، وستجد أن العمل رائع.</p>

<h3 id="البساطة-مقابل-الخبرة">البساطة مقابل الخبرة</h3>

<p>بالطبع، توجد أخطاء، فهو ليس مثالياً ولا كاملاً، ولن ينتج أفضل شيء في العالم. ولكن فكرة تركيزه على هذه الحزمة التقنية تجعل تفكيرك موجهاً. وهذا هو التحدي الذي أراه اليوم: ألا يزيد النموذج اللغوي الكبير العبء على الشخص الذي يستخدمه. لا يمكن القول إن “البرمجة بالحدس” (Vibe Coding) هي مجرد إعطاء أوامر سطحية، لأن ذلك سينتج كوداً سيئاً. وإذا أعطيته أوامر عميقة، فسينتج كوداً أفضل. هذا في حد ذاته لا يعني أنها “برمجة بالحدس”. في الحقيقة، هذا يتطلب “برمجة خبير” (Expert Coding). أنت تحتاج إلى خبير ليرشدك في كيفية كتابة الأوامر.</p>

<p>لكن V0 بصراحة يوازن المعادلة. لاحظ أيضاً أن <code class="highlighter-rouge">Next.js</code> يتمتع بخصائص رائعة، مثل “إجراءات الخادم” (Server Actions)، والقدرة على تشغيل خادم، مما يعني أنه يمكنه فعل كل شيء ضمن نفس الحزمة التقنية. فإذا كنت تنفذ عملية تسجيل دخول (Login)، أو تسجيل خروج (Logout)، أو إنشاء حساب (Sign up)، وتريد حفظ البيانات في قاعدة البيانات، يمكنك فعل ذلك عبر <code class="highlighter-rouge">Next.js</code> مباشرة دون الحاجة إلى واجهة خلفية منفصلة. ومع وجود خدمات مثل <code class="highlighter-rouge">Supabase</code> و<code class="highlighter-rouge">Neon</code>، يمكنك بكل سلاسة دمج <code class="highlighter-rouge">Next.js</code> معها مباشرة من خلال خدمة V0.</p>

<h3 id="دراسة-حالة-mvp-بستة-أوامر">دراسة حالة: MVP بستة أوامر</h3>

<p>قرأت مقالاً يتحدث عن فريق تمكن من كتابة ستة أوامر فقط لإنشاء منتج قابل للتطبيق (MVP) في المجال الطبي باستخدام V0. ليس مجرد منتج أولي، بل منتج قدموه للعميل وقام بتشغيله فعلياً. هل هذا معقول؟</p>

<p>حسناً، لنتفق على شيء. هم قالوا إنهم فعلوا ذلك، ولكن يجب أن نضع كلامهم في سياقه الصحيح. لقد نظرت إلى الأوامر التي استخدموها؛ كانت مكتوبة بواسطة خبير تسويق وخبير منتجات. الشخص الذي كتبها يفهم جيداً جانب العمل. كان يوجه الأداة بشكل دقيق، على سبيل المثال:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“أريدك أن تنشئ لي عنواناً رئيسياً يحتوي على النص (كذا) تحديداً، وعنواناً فرعياً يحتوي على النص (كذا). وأريدك أن تنشئ زراً مكتوباً عليه (كذا)، وعبارة تحث المستخدم على اتخاذ إجراء (Call to Action) هنا، وأن تضع (كذا) في قسم الـ Hero.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>إنه يصف فعلياً وثيقة متطلبات المنتج (PRD) الخاصة بالصفحة. الشخص الذي صاغ هذه الأوامر هو شخص يفهم العمل جيداً، بل هو خبير كبير.</p>

<p>للأمانة، V0 أداة جيدة وستعطيك نتائج جميلة، ولكن غالباً عند نقطة معينة، ستصبح النتائج كلها متشابهة. لكن باستخدام الأمر المكتوب بخبرة، تمكن من إنجاز شيء مهم: لقد ركز على جانب العمل فقط ولم يدخل في التفاصيل التقنية. وهذا يعني أن مدير المنتج الماهر يمكنه استخدام خبرته في المنتج لإنشاء موقع احترافي دون الحاجة لفهم <code class="highlighter-rouge">Next.js</code> أو <code class="highlighter-rouge">Radix</code>. كل ما يحتاج إلى وصفه هو التفاصيل: الشكل، اللون، الفكرة. هو لا يصف أي شيء تقني، وهذه هي أهم نقطة في المعادلة.</p>

<h3 id="التحديات-الأمنية-والتقنية">التحديات الأمنية والتقنية</h3>

<p>حسناً، إذا لم أصف ذلك ولم أشرف عليه بشكل جيد، وركزت فقط على جانب العمل وأنا لست خبيراً في الكود، فما المشاكل التي قد تحدث؟ مشاكل أمنية مثلاً؟ بما أن كل الأكواد أصبحت متشابهة، فإذا تم اكتشاف ثغرة واحدة، ستؤثر على كل الأكواد.</p>

<p>هذه وجهة نظر جيدة. تعقيبي عليها هو أن V0 يركز على حزمة تقنية معينة وهو نفسه من صنع هذه الحزمة (شركة Vercel صنعت <code class="highlighter-rouge">Next.js</code> وV0). هذا يجعل تتبع المشاكل الأمنية وإصلاحها أسرع.</p>

<p>المشاكل الحقيقية التي ستواجهها هي المشاكل التقليدية في البرمجة، والتي لن تتمكن من حلها إذا لم تكن لديك خبرة. على سبيل المثال، محاولة دمج حزمة SDK لا تعمل بسلاسة مع بيئة <code class="highlighter-rouge">Next.js</code>. هذه ليست مشكلة V0 تحديداً، بل هي مشكلة تتعلق بالحزمة التقنية نفسها. وهنا يأتي السؤال الأهم: إذا كنت تبني شيئاً يتطلب تخصيصاً كبيراً، فلا بد لك من الاستعانة بمهندس لتقييم الموقف.</p>

<p>بناءً على هذا، سيظل الأمن أزمة دائمة في أي حزمة تقنية، وهو فكر هندسي عام. لكن في هذه الحالة، لا بد أن يتطور مستواك من مجرد كونك صاحب عمل إلى أن تكتسب بعض المعرفة التقنية، على الأقل لتفهم ما يقدمه لك V0.</p>

<h3 id="هل-يجب-أن-أتعلم-هندسة-الأوامر">هل يجب أن أتعلم هندسة الأوامر؟</h3>

<p>يأتي هنا السؤال المهم: مع ظهور أدوات الذكاء الاصطناعي، هل يجب أن أتعلم هندسة الأوامر (Prompt Engineering)؟</p>

<p>بالطبع. مهما تطورت النماذج اللغوية الكبيرة، وكما ذكرت، فإن V0 يحاول جعلك تكتب أوامر تركز على العمل أكثر، إلا أنك ما زلت تكتب أوامر. ستصف له الشكل، اللون، الفكرة، والموضع. يجب أن تصف كل شيء بدقة. لا يمكنك أن تقول له “صغّر لي هذا”، فهذه عبارة غامضة جداً. بل يجب أن تقول: “أريدك أن تضعها في الثلث العلوي السفلي (Lower Top Third)، على بعد 50 بيكسل من اليمين”. حينها سينفذ طلبك بشكل جيد. لكن التجارب الغامضة مثل “صغّرها قليلاً” أو “حسّنها” لم تعطني أي نتائج جيدة، حتى مع V0.</p>

<p>إذاً، هندسة الأوامر هي إحدى المهارات التي ستصبح أساسية، مثل معرفتك باللغة الإنجليزية. ستصل هندسة الأوامر عند نقطة معينة لتصبح من المسلمات. وهذا ما دفع شركات مثل جوجل لتقديم دورات كاملة لتعليمها.</p>

<p>لذا، أرى أنه يجب على الناس الإسراع بتعلم هذا الفكر، على الأقل الحد الأدنى منه:</p>

<ul>
  <li>افهم ما هو تعريف الأدوار (Role Definition).</li>
  <li>افهم ما هو السياق (Context).</li>
  <li>افهم معنى الذاكرة (Memory).</li>
  <li>تعلم كيف تعطي التعليمات (Instructions) وكيف تصفها.</li>
  <li>افهم الفروق بين هذه العناصر وكيفية تركيبها وتكوينها معاً.</li>
</ul>

          </h2>
          
        </div>

        <!-- Content Section -->
        <div class="p-4 flex-grow overflow-hidden">
          <p class="text-base-content">
            <p>Using Claude Code and other agentic coding tools has become all the rage.  Not
only is it getting <a href="https://npmtrends.com/@anthropic-ai/claude-code-vs-@sentry/react">millions of
downloads</a>,
but these tools are also gaining features that help streamline workflows.  As
you know, <a href="/2025/6/4/changes/">I got very excited</a> about agentic coding in May,
and I&#8217;ve tried many of the new features that have been added.  I&#8217;ve spent
considerable time exploring everything on my plate.</p>
<p>But oddly enough, very little of what I attempted I ended up sticking with.
Most of my attempts didn&#8217;t last, and I thought it might be interesting to share
what didn&#8217;t work.  This doesn&#8217;t mean these approaches won&#8217;t work or are bad
ideas; it just means I didn&#8217;t manage to make them work.  Maybe there&#8217;s
something to learn from these failures for others.</p>
<h2>Rules of Automation</h2>
<p>The best way to think about the approach that I use is:</p>
<ol>
<li>I only automate things that I do regularly.</li>
<li>If I create an automation for something that I do regularly, but then I stop
using the automation, I consider it a failed automation and I delete it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Non-working automations turn out to be quite common.  Either I can&#8217;t get myself
to use them, I forget about them, or I end up fine-tuning them endlessly.  For
me, deleting a failed workflow helper is crucial.  You don&#8217;t want unused Claude
commands cluttering your workspace and confusing others.</p>
<p>So I end up doing the simplest thing possible most of the time: just talk to
the machine more, give it more context, keep the audio input going, and dump my
train of thought into the prompt.  And that is 95% of my workflow.  The rest might
be good use of copy/paste.</p>
<h2>Slash Commands</h2>
<p>Slash commands allow you to preload prompts to have them readily available in a
session.  I expected these to be more useful than they ended up being.  I do
use them, but many of the ones that I added I ended up never using.</p>
<p>There are some limitations with slash commands that make them less useful than
they could be.  One limitation is that there&#8217;s only one way to pass arguments,
and it&#8217;s unstructured.  This proves suboptimal in practice for my uses.
Another issue I keep running into with Claude Code is that if you do use a
slash command, the argument to the slash command for some reason <a href="https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/818">does not
support file-based
autocomplete</a>.</p>
<p>To make them work better, I often ask Claude to use the current Git state to
determine which files to operate on.  For instance, I have a command in this
blog that fixes grammar mistakes.  It operates almost entirely from the current
git status context because providing filenames explicitly is tedious without
autocomplete.</p>
<p>Here is one of the few slash commands I actually do use:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gu">## Context</span>

<span class="k">-</span><span class="w"> </span>git status: !<span class="sb">`git status`</span>
<span class="k">-</span><span class="w"> </span>Explicitly mentioned file to fix: &quot;$ARGUMENTS&quot;

<span class="gu">## Your task</span>

Based on the above information, I want you to edit the mentioned file or files
for grammar mistakes.  Make a backup (eg: change file.md to file.md.bak) so I
can diff it later.  If the backup file already exists, delete it.

If a blog post was explicitly provided, edit that; otherwise, edit the ones
that have pending changes or are untracked.
</pre></div>
<p>My workflow now assumes that Claude can determine which files I mean from the
Git status virtually every time, making explicit arguments largely unnecessary.</p>
<p>Here are some of the many slash commands that I built at one point but ended
up not using:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>/fix-bug</code>: I had a command that instructed Claude to fix bugs by pulling
issues from GitHub and adding extra context. But I saw no meaningful
improvement over simply mentioning the GitHub issue URL and voicing my
thoughts about how to fix it.</li>
<li><code>/commit</code>: I tried getting Claude to write good commit messages, but
they never matched my style. I stopped using this command, though I haven&#8217;t
given up on the idea entirely.</li>
<li><code>/add-tests</code>: I really hoped this would work. My idea was to have Claude
skip tests during development, then use an elaborate reusable prompt to
generate them properly at the end. But this approach wasn&#8217;t consistently better
than automatic test generation, which I&#8217;m still not satisfied with overall.</li>
<li><code>/fix-nits</code>: I had a command to fix linting issues and run formatters.
I stopped using it because it never became muscle memory, and Claude
already knows how to do this. I can just tell it &#8220;fix lint&#8221; in the
CLAUDE.md file without needing a slash command.</li>
<li><code>/next-todo</code>: I track small items in a to-do.md file
and had a command to pull the next item and work on it. Even
here, workflow automation didn&#8217;t help much.
I use this command far less than expected.</li>
</ul>
<p>So if I&#8217;m using fewer slash commands, what am I doing instead?</p>
<ol>
<li>Speech-to-text.  Cannot stress this enough but talking to the machine means
you&#8217;re more likely to share more about what you want it to do.</li>
<li>I maintain some basic prompts and context for copy-pasting at the end or the
beginning of what I entered.</li>
</ol>
<p>Copy/paste is really, really useful because of how fuzzy LLMs are.  For
instance, I maintain link collections that I paste in when needed.  Sometimes I
fetch files proactively, drop them into a git-ignored folder, and mention them.
It&#8217;s simple, easy, and effective.  You still need to be somewhat selective to
avoid polluting your context too much, but compared to having it spelunk in the wrong
places, more text doesn&#8217;t harm as much.</p>
<h2>Hooks</h2>
<p>I tried hard to make hooks work, but I haven&#8217;t seen any efficiency gains from
them yet.  I think part of the problem is that I use yolo mode.  I wish hooks
could actually manipulate what gets executed.  The only way to guide Claude
today is through denies, which don&#8217;t work in yolo mode.  For instance, I tried
using hooks to make it use uv instead of regular Python, but I was unable to do
so.  Instead, I ended up preloading executables on the PATH that override the
default ones, steering Claude toward the right tools.</p>
<p>For instance, this is really my hack for making it use <code>uv run python</code> instead
of <code>python</code> more reliably:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="ch">#!/bin/sh</span>
<span class="nb">echo</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;This project uses uv, please use 'uv run python' instead.&quot;</span>
<span class="nb">exit</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="m">1</span>
</pre></div>
<p>I really just have a bunch of these in <code>.claude/interceptors</code> and preload that
folder onto <code>PATH</code> before launching Claude:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nv">CLAUDE_BASH_MAINTAIN_PROJECT_WORKING_DIR</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="m">1</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="se">\</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nv">PATH</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;`pwd`/.claude/interceptors:</span><span class="si">${</span><span class="nv">PATH</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="se">\</span>
<span class="w">    </span>claude<span class="w"> </span>--dangerously-skip-permissions
</pre></div>
<p>I also found it hard to hook into the right moment.  I wish I could run
formatters at the end of a long edit session.  Currently, you must run
formatters after each Edit tool operation, which often forces Claude to re-read
files, wasting context. Even with the Edit tool hook, I&#8217;m not sure if I&#8217;m
going to keep using it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m actually really curious whether people manage to get good use out of hooks.
I&#8217;ve seen some discussions on Twitter that suggest there are some really good
ways of making them work, but I just went with much simpler solutions instead.</p>
<h2>Claude Print Mode</h2>
<p>I was initially very bullish on Claude&#8217;s print mode.  I tried hard to have
Claude generate scripts that used print mode internally.  For instance, I had
it create a mock data loading script — mostly deterministic code with a
small inference component to generate test data using Claude Code. </p>
<p>The challenge is achieving reliability, which hasn&#8217;t worked well for me yet.
Print mode is slow and difficult to debug.  So I use it far less than I&#8217;d like,
despite loving the concept of mostly deterministic scripts with small inference
components.  Whether using the Claude SDK or the command-line print flag, I
haven&#8217;t achieved the results I hoped for. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m drawn to Print Mode because inference is too much like a slot machine.
Many programming tasks are actually quite rigid and deterministic.  We love
linters and formatters because they&#8217;re unambiguous.  Anything we can fully
automate, we should.  Using an LLM for tasks that don&#8217;t require inference is
the wrong approach in my book.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what makes print mode appealing.  If only it worked better.  Use
an LLM for the commit message, but regular scripts for the commit and gh pr
commands.  Make mock data loading 90% deterministic with only 10% inference.</p>
<p>I still use it, but I see more potential than I am currently leveraging.</p>
<h2>Sub Tasks and Sub Agents</h2>
<p>I use the task tool frequently for basic parallelization and context isolation.
Anthropic recently launched an agents feature meant to streamline this process,
but I haven&#8217;t found it easier to use.</p>
<p>Sub-tasks and sub-agents enable parallelism, but you must be careful.  Tasks
that don&#8217;t parallelize well — especially those mixing reads and writes — create
chaos.  Outside of investigative tasks, I don&#8217;t get good results.  While
sub-agents should preserve context better, I often get better results by
starting new sessions, writing thoughts to Markdown files, or even switching to
o3 in the chat interface.</p>
<h2>Does It Help?</h2>
<p>What&#8217;s interesting about workflow automation is that without rigorous rules
that you consistently follow as a developer, simply taking time to talk to the
machine and give clear instructions outperforms elaborate pre-written prompts.</p>
<p>For instance, I don&#8217;t use emojis or commit prefixes.  I don&#8217;t enforce templates
for pull requests either.  As a result, there&#8217;s less structure for me to teach
the machine.</p>
<p>I also lack the time and motivation to thoroughly evaluate all my created
workflows.  This prevents me from gaining confidence in their value.</p>
<p>Context engineering and management remain major challenges.  Despite my efforts
to help agents pull the right data from various files and commands, they don&#8217;t
yet succeed reliably.  They pull in too much or too little.  Long sessions lead
to forgotten context from the beginning.  Whether done manually or with slash
commands, the results feel too random.  It&#8217;s hard enough with ad-hoc
approaches, but static prompts and commands make it even harder.</p>
<p>The rule I have now is that if I do want to automate something, I must have done it a
few times already, and then I evaluate whether the agent gets any better results
through my automation.  There&#8217;s no exact science to it, but I mostly measure
that right now by letting it do the same task three times and looking at the variance
manually as measured by: would I accept the result.</p>
<h2>Keeping The Brain On</h2>
<p>Forcing myself to evaluate the automation has another benefit: I&#8217;m less likely to
just blindly assume it helps me.</p>
<p>Because there is a big hidden risk with automation through LLMs: it encourages
mental disengagement.  When you stop thinking like an engineer, quality drops,
time gets wasted and you don&#8217;t understand and learn.  LLMs are already bad
enough as they are, but whenever I lean in on automation I notice that it
becomes even easier to disengage.  I tend to overestimate the agent&#8217;s
capabilities with time.  There are real dragons there!</p>
<p>You can still review things as they land, but it becomes increasingly harder to
do so later.  While LLMs are reducing the cost of refactoring, the cost doesn&#8217;t
drop to zero, and regressions are common.</p>

            <p>أنا أعمل في مجال البرمجة لأكثر من 12 عامًا، ولو كنت سأبدأ اليوم، لفعلت ذلك بشكل مختلف تمامًا. الأدوات أصبحت أذكى بفضل الذكاء الاصطناعي، والمصادر أفضل، لكن الحيرة لا تزال حقيقية جدًا. إذا كنت تشعر بالإرهاق، أو عالقًا، أو غير متأكد مما إذا كنت ستبدأ بـ HTML، جافاسكريبت، بايثون، أو أي لغة برمجة أخرى، فهذا المقال لك.</p>

<h3 id="الحقيقة-الصادمة-ليست-لديك-مشكلة-في-التعلم">الحقيقة الصادمة: ليست لديك مشكلة في التعلم</h3>
<p>الحقيقة هي أنك لا تواجه مشكلة في التعلم. أنت لست غبيًا. كل ما في الأمر أنك لا تملك مسارًا واضحًا. ما تحتاجه هو خطة مفصلة خطوة بخطوة، توضح ماذا تتعلم وكيف تتعلمه. قبل 12 عامًا، كنت أتنقل بين منشورات المدونات العشوائية والدروس التعليمية غير المكتملة، آملًا ألا أحرق حاسوبي المحمول.</p>

<p>اسمي بيت، وأنا مبرمج محترف منذ عام 2012. الآن، أساعد آلاف المطورين الجدد على تخطي الضوضاء وتحقيق تقدم حقيقي. في هذا المقال، سأوضح لك كيف. بحلول النهاية، لن تعرف فقط من أين تبدأ، بل ستعرف كيف تستمر، وهذا هو الأهم.</p>

<h3 id="لماذا-تشعر-بالحيرة-والأمر-ليس-خطأك">لماذا تشعر بالحيرة؟ (والأمر ليس خطأك)</h3>
<p>أنت لست كسولًا، ولست بطيئًا، وبالتأكيد لست وحدك. أنت في حيرة لأن تعلم البرمجة لا يبدو بسيطًا. إنه أشبه بمحاولة قراءة خمسة كتب في نفس الوقت بينما يصرخ الجميع في أذنيك “تعلم!”. هناك مليون درس تعليمي، وكل شخص يقول شيئًا مختلفًا. والآن، مع ظهور أدوات الذكاء الاصطناعي في كل مكان، يبدو وكأنك متأخر بالفعل حتى قبل أن تبدأ. بحلول الوقت الذي تنهي فيه مقالًا واحدًا، تكون ثلاث أدوات جديدة ومنصتان جديدتان للذكاء الاصطناعي قد ظهرتا بالفعل. هل يبدو هذا مألوفًا؟ مرحبًا بك في تعلم البرمجة في عام 2025.</p>

<p>الحقيقة هي أنك لا تتعلم البرمجة فحسب، بل تتعلم كيفية تعلم البرمجة في عالم يتغير أسرع من قدرتك على البحث عن رسالة خطأ في جوجل. ومعظم المحتوى المتاح إما أساسي جدًا، أو متقدم جدًا، أو يفترض أنك تعرف بالفعل ما هو الطرفية (Terminal).</p>

<p>فماذا يحدث؟ تلتهم الدروس التعليمية، وتتابع بالنسخ واللصق، لكنك تشعر أنك لا تتعلم أي شيء حقًا. هذا الشعور له اسم: “جحيم الدروس التعليمية” (Tutorial Hell). إنه المكان الذي يختفي فيه الحافز، ولا تلاحظ حتى أنك عالق حتى تمر شهور وما زلت غير قادر على بناء أي شيء بنفسك.</p>

<p>لكن الخبر السار هو أن هذا الوضع ليس دائمًا. وبمجرد أن تفهم سبب حدوث ذلك، يمكنك أخيرًا التحرر والبدء في التعلم بالطريقة الصحيحة، بطريقة تناسبك بالفعل. وسنتحدث عن كيف يمكن للذكاء الاصطناعي أن يساعد بالفعل لا أن يضر.</p>

<h3 id="الخطوة-الأولى-ابدأ-بـ-لماذا-وليس-بلغة-البرمجة">الخطوة الأولى: ابدأ بـ “لماذا” وليس بلغة البرمجة</h3>
<p>قبل أن تقلق بشأن لغة البرمجة التي يجب أن تتعلمها، اسأل نفسك شيئًا واحدًا: لماذا تريد تعلم البرمجة؟ يبدو الأمر بسيطًا، لكن بصراحة، هذا السؤال يغير قواعد اللعبة.</p>
<ul>
  <li>هل تريد بناء مواقع وتطبيقات ويب مثل نسخة الويب من يوتيوب، سبوتيفاي، نتفليكس، فيسبوك، إلخ؟</li>
  <li>هل تريد الحصول على وظيفة عن بعد وكسب الكثير من المال؟</li>
  <li>هل تريد أتمتة المهام المملة؟</li>
  <li>هل تريد بدء العمل الحر وربما إنشاء وكالتك الصغيرة أو الكبيرة؟</li>
  <li>هل تريد فقط الدخول إلى مجال التكنولوجيا بطريقة ما ولكنك غير متأكد من كيفية ذلك؟</li>
</ul>

<p>إجابتك يجب أن توجه مسارك، وليس موضوعًا عشوائيًا على Reddit يخبرك أن “جافاسكريبت هي الحياة”.</p>

<p>إليك طريقة بسيطة للنظر إلى الأمر:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>لتطوير الويب:</strong> إذا كنت ترغب في بناء مواقع الويب أو أن تصبح مطور ويب، فستحتاج إلى البدء بـ <code class="highlighter-rouge">HTML</code>، <code class="highlighter-rouge">CSS</code>، و <code class="highlighter-rouge">JavaScript</code>. هذا هو جوهر تطوير الويب. تعلم هذا سيأخذك بعيدًا. لاحقًا، ستنتقل إلى أشياء مثل React، Git، وربما حتى أدوات تصحيح الأخطاء.</li>
  <li><strong>للأتمتة والبيانات:</strong> إذا كنت مهتمًا أكثر بالأتمتة، أو كتابة السكربتات، أو التعامل مع البيانات، فابدأ ببساطة مع <code class="highlighter-rouge">Python</code>. إنها لغة نظيفة، صديقة للمبتدئين، وتستخدم في كل شيء من الذكاء الاصطناعي إلى أتمتة المهام اليومية. يمكنك استخدامها لاستخراج البيانات من المواقع، تحليل البيانات، أو بناء أدوات بسيطة بسرعة.</li>
  <li><strong>لتطوير الألعاب أو الأنظمة منخفضة المستوى:</strong> إذا كنت ترغب في بناء الألعاب أو فهم كيفية عمل الأشياء خلف الكواليس، فربما ترغب في استكشاف <code class="highlighter-rouge">C++</code>، <code class="highlighter-rouge">Java</code>، أو <code class="highlighter-rouge">C</code>. هذا المسار مخصص للأشخاص الذين يحبون حل المشكلات المعقدة، أو بناء الأشياء من الصفر، أو مهووسون بكيفية عمل محركات الألعاب أو الأنظمة بالفعل. إنه مسار أصعب، نعم، ولكن إذا كنت مهتمًا بالألعاب، أو الأداء، أو التفكير على المستوى الهندسي، فقد يكون الأكثر إثارة.</li>
</ul>

<p>الخطأ الذي يرتكبه معظم المبتدئين هو القفز إلى لغة برمجة دون معرفة ما يريدون فعله بها. يسمعون في مكان ما أن “عليك تعلم Java، إنها الأفضل”. مع عدم الإساءة لأصدقائي مطوري Java، لكن هذا يشبه حجز تذكرة طيران قبل معرفة وجهتك، فقط لأن شخصًا ما أخبرك بذلك.</p>

<p>لذا، خذ لحظة وكن صريحًا مع نفسك. ماذا تريد من البرمجة؟ كلما كان “لماذا” الخاص بك أوضح، كان من الأسهل اختيار المسار الصحيح. ولا تقلق، سأوضح لك المسارات الثلاثة وكيفية البدء في كل منها خطوة بخطوة.</p>

<h3 id="الخريطة-الحقيقية-اختر-مسارك">الخريطة الحقيقية: اختر مسارك</h3>
<p>حسنًا، لقد اكتشفت لماذا تريد تعلم البرمجة. الآن لنتحدث عما يجب أن تتعلمه وبأي ترتيب. لأنه لا يوجد مسار واحد صحيح، ولكن هناك مسار ذكي. مسار يتجنب الإرهاق، وجحيم الدروس التعليمية، ومتلازمة “لقد كنت أتعلم لمدة عام وما زلت لا أستطيع بناء أي شيء”.</p>

<p>دعنا نلقي نظرة على ثلاثة مسارات شائعة للمبتدئين، وسأوضح لك ما يجب أن تتعلمه أولاً بناءً على ما تريد فعله بالبرمجة.</p>

<h4 id="المسار-الأول-تطوير-الويب-web-development">المسار الأول: تطوير الويب (Web Development)</h4>
<p>إذا كنت ترغب في بناء مواقع الويب، أو محافظ الأعمال، أو تطبيقات الويب الكاملة، فهذا هو المسار الأكثر شيوعًا.</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>الأساسيات:</strong> ستبدأ بـ <code class="highlighter-rouge">HTML</code> و <code class="highlighter-rouge">CSS</code> لبناء وتصميم الهيكل الأساسي لصفحات الويب.</li>
  <li><strong>التفاعلية:</strong> بعد ذلك، ستتعلم <code class="highlighter-rouge">JavaScript</code> لجعل مواقعك تفاعلية، مثل الأزرار التي تفعل أشياء، والقوائم المنسدلة، والنماذج، والرسوم المتحركة.</li>
  <li><strong>مشاريع صغيرة:</strong> ستقوم ببناء بعض المشاريع الصغيرة مثل قائمة مهام (to-do list)، أو آلة حاسبة، أو حتى محفظة أعمالك الشخصية.</li>
  <li><strong>الأدوات المتقدمة:</strong> من هناك، ستتعلم أشياء مثل <code class="highlighter-rouge">Git</code> و <code class="highlighter-rouge">GitHub</code> لحفظ ومشاركة شفرتك البرمجية، والتلاعب بـ <code class="highlighter-rouge">DOM</code> لجعل موقعك يستجيب للمستخدمين في الوقت الفعلي، وفي النهاية أدوات مثل <code class="highlighter-rouge">React</code>، <code class="highlighter-rouge">Vue</code>، أو <code class="highlighter-rouge">Node.js</code> لنقل مهاراتك إلى مستوى المطور المتكامل (full-stack).</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="المسار-الثاني-بايثون-python-للأتمتة-السكربتات-أو-البيانات">المسار الثاني: بايثون (Python) للأتمتة، السكربتات، أو البيانات</h4>
<p>هل تريد أتمتة المهام المملة، أو العمل مع البيانات، أو البدء بشيء صديق للمبتدئين؟ بايثون نظيفة، بسيطة، وقوية للغاية.</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>الأساسيات:</strong> ستبدأ بالأساسيات، وتبني أدوات صغيرة مثل مولدات كلمات المرور أو تطبيقات الاختبارات.</li>
  <li><strong>التخصص:</strong> ثم تغوص في أشياء مثل سكربتات الأتمتة، أو تحليل البيانات، أو حتى تطوير الويب باستخدام بايثون مع <code class="highlighter-rouge">Flask</code> أو <code class="highlighter-rouge">Django</code>.
إنه المسار الأكثر مرونة إذا كنت لا تزال تكتشف أين تريد أن تتجه.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="المسار-الثالث-تطوير-الألعاب-أو-البرمجة-منخفضة-المستوى-c-java">المسار الثالث: تطوير الألعاب أو البرمجة منخفضة المستوى (C++, Java)</h4>
<p>إذا كنت مهتمًا أكثر ببناء الألعاب أو تريد فهم كيفية عمل الأشياء “تحت الغطاء”، فهذا هو المسار الأكثر تقدمًا، ولكنه أيضًا الأكثر متعة إذا كنت تحب التحديات.</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>اللغات الأساسية:</strong> ستعمل مع لغات مثل <code class="highlighter-rouge">C++</code>، <code class="highlighter-rouge">Java</code>، أو <code class="highlighter-rouge">C</code>.</li>
  <li><strong>محركات الألعاب:</strong> ستستخدم أدوات مثل <code class="highlighter-rouge">Unity</code> لتطوير الألعاب، من الألعاب ثنائية الأبعاد إلى تطبيقات الكونسول، واستكشاف محركات مثل <code class="highlighter-rouge">Unity</code> أو <code class="highlighter-rouge">Unreal</code>.
هذا المسار مخصص للبناة، والمبدعين، وحلالي المشكلات.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>لست متأكدا بعد؟ ابدأ ببساطة.</strong>
إذا كنت غير متأكد من أين تبدأ، فإن اقتراحي هو البدء بتطوير الويب الأساسي أو بايثون. من السهل تعلمهما، والطلب عليهما مرتفع، ويمنحانك أساسًا متينًا لأي اتجاه لاحقًا.</p>

<h3 id="كيف-تتعلم-بشكل-صحيح-وتتجنب-الإرهاق">كيف تتعلم بشكل صحيح وتتجنب الإرهاق</h3>
<p>لنكن واقعيين، هذا هو الجزء الذي لا يتحدث عنه أحد. لا يتوقف الناس عن البرمجة لأنها صعبة للغاية، بل يتوقفون لأنهم يصابون بالإرهاق. أنت تقفز باستمرار بين الدروس التعليمية، وتشعر أنك لا تحرز تقدمًا، وفجأة تشعر بالتعب، والإحباط، والشك فيما إذا كانت هذه فكرة جيدة في المقام الأول.</p>

<p><strong>لماذا يحدث الإرهاق؟</strong>
الأمر ليس مجرد حمولة زائدة من المعلومات، بل هو تعلم بلا اتجاه. عندما تشاهد باستمرار دروسًا جديدة، أو تغير الموضوعات، أو تحاول القيام بالكثير بسرعة كبيرة، فإن عقلك لا يحصل أبدًا على فرصة لهضم أي شيء. إنه مثل محاولة بناء منزل عن طريق شراء أدوات جديدة كل يوم ولكن دون وضع أي طوب. النتيجة؟ ينتهي بك الأمر مع مجموعة من الإشارات المرجعية، ومشاريع نصف منتهية، وشعور عميق بـ “أنا فاشل في هذا”. أنت لست كذلك، أنت فقط بحاجة إلى تغيير طريقة تعلمك.</p>

<p><strong>كيف تتعلم بذكاء، وليس بجهد فقط</strong>
إليك نظام يعمل بالفعل ويبقيك متحفزًا:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>تعلم مفهومًا، ثم ابنِ شيئًا به على الفور:</strong> لا تشاهد فقط، بل طبق. حتى لو كان شيئًا صغيرًا، اصنع شيئًا به. شاهدت درسًا عن الحلقات (loops)؟ اصنع اختبارًا صغيرًا. تعلمت عن الدوال (functions)؟ ابنِ آلة حاسبة بسيطة. هذا هو المكان الذي يحدث فيه 80% من تعلمك الحقيقي.</li>
  <li><strong>التزم بمصدر واحد في كل مرة:</strong> القفز بين ستة منشئي محتوى مختلفين على يوتيوب أو 12 دورة على Udemy لن يساعدك على التعلم بشكل أسرع، بل سيزيد من حيرتك. اختر واحدًا واتبعه حتى النهاية. يمكنك دائمًا استكشاف الآخرين لاحقًا بمجرد الانتهاء وبناء شيء ما.</li>
  <li><strong>تصالح مع عدم فهم كل شيء على الفور:</strong> لن تفهم كل شيء من المحاولة الأولى، وهذا طبيعي. إذا فهمت حلقات <code class="highlighter-rouge">if</code> بشكل مثالي من المرة الأولى، فقد تكون ساحرًا بالفعل. بقيتنا يجب أن نكافح من خلالها. خذ فترات راحة وعد إليها، وهذا جيد.</li>
  <li><strong>تتبع التقدم بالانتصارات، وليس بالكمال:</strong> توقف عن انتظار أن يصبح مشروعك مثاليًا قبل أن تعتبره نجاحًا. هل صنعت زرًا يعمل اليوم؟ هذا انتصار. هل كتبت أول حلقة <code class="highlighter-rouge">for</code> لك؟ انتصار ضخم. هل دفعت شفرتك إلى GitHub؟ أنت نجم. يُقاس التقدم بالانتصارات الصغيرة وليس بالمحافظ المثالية.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="استخدم-الذكاء-الاصطناعي-لمساعدتك-وليس-ليحل-محلك">استخدم الذكاء الاصطناعي لمساعدتك، وليس ليحل محلك</h3>
<p>أدوات الذكاء الاصطناعي مثل ChatGPT و GitHub Copilot موجودة لمساعدتك. فكر فيها كمطور أقدم يهمس لك بالتلميحات في أذنك، وليس كشخص يقوم بالعمل بأكمله نيابة عنك. يمكنك استخدام الذكاء الاصطناعي لـ:</p>
<ul>
  <li>تصحيح الأخطاء (Debug errors).</li>
  <li>شرح الشفرات أو الموضوعات المربكة.</li>
  <li>توليد أفكار للمشاريع.</li>
  <li>تبسيط الوثائق التقنية.</li>
  <li>والأهم من ذلك، طرح الأسئلة “الغبية” دون الشعور بالحكم.</li>
</ul>

<p>لكن تذكر، لا تعتمد عليه في كل شيء. دعه يعلمك، لا أن يحملك. تعلم البرمجة ليس سباقًا، بل هو حرفة. وكلما كانت عادات التعلم الخاصة بك أكثر استدامة، كلما بقيت في اللعبة لفترة أطول.</p>

<h3 id="من-الحيرة-إلى-الثقة-نصيحتي-لك">من الحيرة إلى الثقة: نصيحتي لك</h3>
<p>لقد وصلت إلى هذا الحد، وهذا يضعك بالفعل في مقدمة معظم الأشخاص الذين لا يتجاوزون البحث في جوجل عن “كيفية تعلم البرمجة”. دعني أكون صريحًا معك: تعلم البرمجة لا يتعلق بكونك عبقريًا، بل يتعلق بالاستمرارية عندما لا يكون الأمر سهلاً، ومسامحة نفسك عندما تشعر بأنك عالق.</p>

<p>لأن الحقيقة هي أن الجميع يشعرون بأنهم عالقون في بعض الأحيان. حتى المطورون الذين لديهم سنوات من الخبرة ما زالوا يواجهون الأخطاء، والشاشات الفارغة، ولحظات “ليس لدي أي فكرة عما أفعله”. لكن هذا هو الفرق: أولئك الذين ينجحون، لا يستسلمون.</p>

<p>إليك ما أتمنى لو أخبرني به أحدهم عندما بدأت:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>لست بحاجة إلى معرفة كل شيء:</strong> أنت فقط بحاجة إلى معرفة ما يكفي لبناء شيء صغير، ثم شيء أكبر قليلاً، وهذا كل شيء. اجمع الانتصارات، وليس الدروس التعليمية.</li>
  <li><strong>لا تطارد 10 مهارات في وقت واحد:</strong> أتقن خطوة واحدة، ابنِ بها، ثم انتقل. محاولة تعلم React، Tailwind، APIs، و TypeScript كلها في وقت واحد هي وصفة للإرهاق وليس للتقدم.</li>
  <li><strong>توقف عن الانتظار حتى تكون “جاهزًا”:</strong> لن تشعر أبدًا بأنك جاهز. أنت تتعلم أكثر أثناء البناء، وليس قبله. ابدأ بشكل قبيح، وحسّن لاحقًا.</li>
  <li><strong>الشعور بأنك محتال أمر طبيعي:</strong> ذلك الصوت في رأسك الذي يقول “أنت لست مناسبًا لهذا”، كل مطور يسمعه، حتى المحترفون. هذا لا يعني أنك لست جيدًا بما فيه الكفاية، بل يعني أنك تنمو.</li>
  <li><strong>أنت بالفعل أفضل مما تعتقد:</strong> حقيقة أنك تقرأ هذا، وتفكر في مسار تعلمك، وتهتم بما يكفي للتحسين، تضعك بالفعل في مقدمة المتصفح العادي.</li>
</ol>

<p>وتذكر، عالم التكنولوجيا يتغير بسرعة، ولكنك كذلك. لديك أدوات أذكى، ووصول أكبر، ودعم أكثر من أي جيل من المتعلمين قبلك. الشيء الوحيد المفقود هو العمل.</p>

<p>لذا، اتخذ تلك الخطوة التالية. ابنِ شيئًا صغيرًا. ابدأ من حيث أنت، بما لديك. لست بحاجة إلى تعلم كل شيء، أنت فقط بحاجة إلى البدء. لست بحاجة إلى مسار مثالي، فقط مسار واقعي.</p>

<p>إذن، ها أنت ذا. لست بحاجة إلى تعلم كل شيء، أنت فقط بحاجة إلى اختيار مسار، واتخاذ الخطوة التالية، والبدء في البناء. سواء كان ذلك تطوير الويب، أو بايثون، أو تطوير الألعاب، فإن ما يهم أكثر هو أن تفعل شيئًا بما تتعلمه. حتى لو كان صغيرًا، حتى لو كان قبيحًا. لأن كل مطور تعجب به، بدأ تمامًا من حيث أنت الآن: مشاريع سخيفة، شفرات مكسورة، نسخ ولصق لأشياء لم يفهموها. الفرق هو أنهم استمروا، وأنت تستطيع ذلك أيضًا.</p>

            <p>في هذا المقال، سأتحدث عن كيف بدأت العمل في مجال البرمجة، وتحديدًا تطوير الويب، بعد ستة أشهر من الدراسة اليومية. الغرض من هذا المقال هو أن أحكي تجربتي الشخصية، لعلّك تمر بظروف مشابهة أو يمكنك الاستفادة من بعض الأخطاء التي ارتكبتها وتتجنبها في رحلتك التعليمية. لنبدأ في الموضوع مباشرة.</p>

<h3 id="البداية-والقرار">البداية والقرار</h3>
<p>أول دورة برمجة قررت أخيرًا أن أشتريها وأبدأ في دراستها كانت دورة “Front-end Web Development” من شركة Udacity، أو ما كان يسمى “Front-end Developer Nanodegree”. جاء هذا الاختيار بعد فترة طويلة من التذبذب والارتباك، والتي تحدثت عنها في مقال سابق حول كيف ساعدتني ساعتان من البرمجة يوميًا على التحول المهني من القطاع المصرفي إلى البرمجة.</p>

<p>بعد فترات طويلة من التشتت، استقررت على التركيز في هذه الدورة مهما كلف الأمر، لأنني كنت شغوفًا حقًا بمجال الويب، وتحديدًا تطوير الواجهات الأمامية (Front-end). ربما كان هذا الخيار هو الأسهل بالنسبة لي كمبتدئ لا يعرف أي شيء على الإطلاق عن المجال. بدأت هذه الدورة وأنهيتها في ستة أشهر.</p>

<h3 id="أول-وظيفة-العمل-الحر">أول وظيفة: العمل الحر</h3>
<p>مباشرة بعد ذلك، بدأت في البحث عن وظائف مناسبة لما تعلمته في الدورة. في ذلك الوقت، كنت أبحث تحديدًا عن وظائف العمل الحر (Freelancing) أو الوظائف المؤقتة بعقود غير ثابتة، لأنني داخليًا لم أكن متأكدًا من قدرتي على العمل في شركة بالمهارات والخبرات التي اكتسبتها من الدورة فقط.</p>

<p>بعد أسبوعين من إنهاء الدورة، وجدت وظيفة مع مطور ويب لا يزال صديقي حتى الآن، اسمه خوان، يعيش في أمريكا. كان يريد اثنين من المطورين المبتدئين (Junior Developers)، أو حتى من لا يزالون في مرحلة التعلم، أحدهما لتطوير الواجهات الأمامية والآخر للخلفية (Back-end)، لمساعدته في تطبيق كان يعمل عليه لعميل في ولاية كاليفورنيا.</p>

<p>كانت فكرة التطبيق ببساطة هي عرض وبيع الوحدات السكنية في الولاية. كان المكدس التقني (Technology Stack) في ذلك الوقت بسيطًا جدًا مقارنة بالوضع الحالي، حيث كان مطلوبًا مني فقط معرفة:</p>
<ul>
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
  <li>JavaScript</li>
  <li>jQuery</li>
</ul>

<p>لمن لا يعرف jQuery، هي مكتبة كانت منتشرة قبل ظهور المكتبات الكثيرة مثل React وAngular وغيرها. لا تزال jQuery موجودة حتى الآن، لكنها لم تعد مستخدمة كما في السابق.</p>

<p>كانت وظيفتي في المشروع بسيطة جدًا، وهي التعامل مع المنطق المكتوب للتفاعل مع العميل عند ملء استمارة معينة والتأكد من صحته. على سبيل المثال، عندما يكتب العميل الرمز البريدي لمنطقة معينة، كنت أضيف له شرطة (-) تلقائيًا بعد عدد معين من الأرقام. كما كنت أتأكد من أن البيانات التي يكتبها العميل في أي استمارة صحيحة، فعندما يكتب بريدًا إلكترونيًا، يجب أن يكون نمط البريد الإلكتروني صحيحًا. كانت هذه كلها أساسيات تعلمتها في الدورة، لذا وجدت نفسي أتعامل معها بسهولة نسبية، على الرغم من أنني لم أشارك في بناء المشروع من البداية، بل انضممت إليه وهو يحتوي بالفعل على أجزاء كثيرة مطورة.</p>

<h3 id="أهمية-الموجه-mentor">أهمية الموجه (Mentor)</h3>
<p>بفضل التوفيق، لعب الحظ دورًا مهمًا جدًا في تعلمي بشكل كبير في تلك المرحلة. كان خوان شخصًا محترمًا جدًا معي وكان بمثابة الموجه (Mentor) بمعنى الكلمة. كان يعلم يقينًا أنني مبتدئ لا أزال أتعلم، وكان يساعدني كثيرًا على تحسين الكود الخاص بي، ويشرح لي لماذا طريقة معينة أفضل من أخرى، وكان يتغاضى عن كل الأخطاء التي أرتكبها. كان يحاول قدر الإمكان مساعدتي على تجنبها منذ البداية حتى لا نواجه مشكلة لاحقًا.</p>

<p>تعلمت أشياء كثيرة جدًا في هذه الوظيفة، لكن أهمها كان تعلم كيفية العمل في بيئة عمل كمطور. كنا نكتب مهامنا في لوحة على موقع يسمى Trello، وهو برنامج لإدارة المهام، حيث كنا نضع وظائفنا في أعمدة مختلفة:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>To-Do (المهام المطلوب إنجازها):</strong> المهام التي لم نبدأ بها بعد.</li>
  <li><strong>In Progress (قيد التنفيذ):</strong> المهام التي نعمل عليها حاليًا.</li>
  <li><strong>Done (المنجزة):</strong> المهام التي تم الانتهاء منها.</li>
</ul>

<p>بهذه الطريقة، كنا جميعًا نعرف في نفس الوقت ما الذي نفعله وعلى ماذا نعمل. لقد تعلمت هذه الأمور في وقت مبكر جدًا.</p>

<h3 id="الاستمرار-في-التعلم">الاستمرار في التعلم</h3>
<p>استمررت في العمل مع خوان لفترة، وعملت معه على مشاريع أخرى بدوام جزئي، حيث كنت لا أزال أعمل بدوام كامل في البنك في وظيفة لا علاقة لها بالبرمجة. في تلك الفترة، كان من المهم جدًا أن أستمر في دراستي بغض النظر عن عملي، فالبرمجة ليست وظيفة يمكن تعلمها بمجرد مشاهدة شخص آخر يقوم بها. على عكس مهنة النجارة مثلًا، حيث يمكن للمتدرب أن يتعلم من معلمه مع مرور الوقت، في البرمجة يجب أن تظل تدرس باستمرار.</p>

<p>يجب أن تكون أي معرفة تكتسبها تصب في النهاية في هدفك أو التخصص الذي تنوي الاستمرار فيه. لا تذهب لدراسة لغة أو إطار عمل لمجرد أن شخصًا ما أخبرك أنه الأفضل، بينما لا علاقة له بتخصصك. هذا خطأ كبير جدًا. وتيرة النمو في المجالات المختلفة أصبحت سريعة جدًا، وليس هناك وقت حرفيًا لتضييعه في تعلم شيء لن تستخدمه أو ستضعه جانبًا مع الوقت.</p>

<p>استمررت في العمل على مشاريع حرة مع خوان، وكنت مرتاحًا جدًا في التعامل معه. بعد ذلك، بدأت تأتيني بعض العقود المؤقتة مع شركات أخرى، أبرزها شركة في أمريكا يملكها هنود، كانت تعمل في تقديم خدمات استضافة المواقع. كانت وظيفتي هي التأكد من أن كل شيء في الواجهة الأمامية للوحة تحكم المسؤول يعمل بشكل جيد وأن كل شيء في مكانه.</p>

<h3 id="نقطة-التحول-الخوارزميات-وهياكل-البيانات">نقطة التحول: الخوارزميات وهياكل البيانات</h3>
<p>بعد فترة، شعرت ببعض الثقة الزائدة وقررت أن أجرب حظي في التقديم للشركات المختلفة. أول شركة قدمت فيها كانت وكالة تسويق في مصر. كان من ضمن أسئلة المقابلة أن أعطاني مجموعة من شعارات الرعاة المختلفين الذين يعملون معهم. كانت المهمة باختصار عرض خمسة شعارات تتبادل أماكنها مع بعضها البعض كل 10 ثوانٍ، بحيث لا يتكرر أي شعار أكثر من مرة.</p>

<p>في ذلك الوقت، لم أكن أعرف الكثير عن هياكل البيانات والخوارزميات بشكل عميق. كنت أفهم ما هو الكائن (Object) وما هي المصفوفة (Array)، لكنني لم أكن أفهم مزايا وعيوب كل منهما. كنت أعرف أنني بحاجة لاستخدام مصفوفة في هذه الحالة، لكنني لم أكن أعرف المنطق أو الخوارزمية التي تمكنني من تبديل (Shuffle) الشعارات.</p>

<p>بالطبع، تم رفضي في هذه المقابلة، لكن الشخص الذي أجرى المقابلة معي أعطاني نصيحة، وقال لي: “أنت بحاجة لتعلم المزيد عن الخوارزميات وهياكل البيانات، لأنك تفهم الأساسيات فقط ولست متعمقًا فيها، ولا يزال أمامك الكثير في هذا الجانب”.</p>

<p>كانت هذه نقطة تحول فارقة بالنسبة لي. مباشرة بعد تلك المقابلة، بدأت في تعلم الخوارزميات وهياكل البيانات. بدأت أفهم ما هي المصفوفة، ومم تتكون، وكيف يتم تخزينها في الذاكرة، ومتى ولماذا نستخدمها. بدأت أفهم جداول التجزئة (Hash Tables)، والكائنات، والقواميس (Dictionaries) في لغات مثل Python. بدأت أتدرب على حل المشكلات على مواقع مثل CodeWars (وصلت فيه إلى المستوى 3 أو 4، لا أتذكر بالضبط) وحللت عددًا لا بأس به من المسائل على موقع LeetCode، وهو من أشهر مواقع التدريب على حل المشكلات.</p>

<p>إلى جانب الخوارزميات وهياكل البيانات، بدأت أتعمق أكثر في React، ودخلت أيضًا في مجال تطوير الواجهات الخلفية باستخدام Node.js وExpress. بدأت أعمل أكثر على الخادم وأفهم ما هي قاعدة البيانات، وكيف تتواصل مع الواجهة الأمامية، وكيف يوجد خادم في المنتصف بينهما (أو بالأحرى خادمان: خادم ويب وخادم تطبيق). درست هذه الأمور كلها بشكل نظري أولاً، ثم بدأت في ربط قاعدة بيانات معينة بالواجهة الأمامية عندي والعمل على كتابة ما يسمى RESTful API، وهو ببساطة معيار معين لتصميم واجهات برمجة التطبيقات (APIs).</p>

<p>بعد الستة أشهر التي درست فيها HTML، CSS، JavaScript، وjQuery، والتي حصلت بعدها على أول وظيفة حرة، لم تستغرق مني React وNode.js نفس المدة. استغرقت React مني شهرًا ونصفًا بالضبط، بينما استغرق Node.js حوالي شهرين.</p>

<p>بعد أن أنهيت دراسة أساسيات React وNode.js وفهمت كيفية عملهما، وأنشأت بهما حوالي ثلاثة أو أربعة مشاريع، قدمت على وظيفة في شركة في مصر كانت تطور تطبيقًا للياقة البدنية. قابلت حينها مهندسًا محترمًا جدًا اسمه إبراهيم أسامة، وهو مهندس كبير يعمل حاليًا في أستراليا في شركة Atlassian. أجرى معي مقابلة تعتبر من أصعب المقابلات التي مررت بها في حياتي، لكنه كان معجبًا إلى حد ما بكوني مبتدئًا وقادرًا على الإجابة على كثير من الأسئلة التي طرحها. بالطبع، كانت هناك أسئلة لم أستطع الإجابة عليها أو لم أفهم ما الذي يريد الوصول إليه من خلالها. انتهى الأمر بقبولي في الوظيفة، لكننا لم نتفق على المقابل المادي.</p>

<p>بعد ثلاثة أو أربعة أشهر بالضبط، حصلت على وظيفة في شركة ألمانية كانت تعمل بنظام التعهيد (Outsourcing) للمهندسين في مصر. كانت هذه بداية رحلتي في الوظائف بدوام كامل في الشركات المختلفة.</p>

<h3 id="من-طالب-إلى-موجه">من طالب إلى موجه</h3>
<p>بعد العمل في تلك الشركة لفترة، اتجهت إلى فكرة التدريس. أشعر أن لدي بعض القدرة على توصيل المعلومة بشكل جيد للناس. جاءني عرض من شركة Udacity، التي كنت طالبًا فيها يومًا ما، عن طريق صديقي المهندس أحمد بهي. طلب مني أن أتولى مسؤولية مدرسة البرمجة وتطوير الويب في الشركة. كانت وظيفتي باختصار هي تعيين مدرسين لشرح المواد للطلاب المشتركين في الدورات، وكنت أضع أسئلة الامتحانات وأسئلة القبول، وغيرها من المهام المماثلة. بعد ذلك، انتقلت إلى طوكيو، اليابان، في وظيفتي الحالية.</p>

<h3 id="نصائح-هامة-لرحلتك-التعليمية">نصائح هامة لرحلتك التعليمية</h3>
<p>بعد أن استمعت لقصتي، سأقدم لك بعض النصائح المهمة التي قد تفيدك في رحلتك التعليمية، خاصة إذا كنت تشعر في أي مرحلة من المراحل التي مررت بها، أو إذا كنت من الأشخاص المشتتين أو تشعر بأنك تائه ولا تعرف ما إذا كنت تسير في الطريق الصحيح أم لا.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>لا تضيع وقتك:</strong> ليس لديك وقت لتضيعه في دراسة شيء لن تستخدمه في تخصصك. تحدثت عن هذه النقطة سابقًا، لكنها مهمة جدًا. هناك الكثير من الأشخاص على الإنترنت يحاولون الترويج للغات أو أطر عمل معينة لأسباب خاصة بهم. كقاعدة عامة، إذا كان هذا الشيء أو تلك اللغة لا علاقة لها بالتخصص الذي تنوي الاستمرار فيه، فلا تلتفت إليها ولا تعرها أي اهتمام.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>الخوارزميات وهياكل البيانات أساسية:</strong> لا مفر من تعلم هياكل البيانات والخوارزميات. نعم، قد تتمكن من العمل دون فهمها جيدًا في البداية، كما فعلت أنا في بداية مسيرتي كعامل حر. لكن لاحقًا، عندما تعمل على مشاريع أكبر وأكثر تعقيدًا، ستجد نفسك مجبرًا على تعلمها، لأن تطبيقاتك يجب أن تكون فعالة من حيث السرعة واستهلاك الذاكرة. هذه أمور مهمة لا يجب أن تتغاضى عنها. لا يوجد ما يمنعك إطلاقًا من تعلم لغة تخفي عنك كيفية التعامل مع الذاكرة (Memory Management) مثل Python أو JavaScript في البداية، ثم تقرأ نظريًا عن الذاكرة والمؤشرات (Pointers) وتتدرب عليها بلغة جديدة مثل C أو C++. ليس من الضروري أن تتعلم C++ أولاً ثم JavaScript. إذا تعلمت C++ في البداية، قد يكون تعلم JavaScript أسهل نسبيًا، ولكن العكس صحيح أيضًا. الانتقال من لغة إلى أخرى ليس هو العائق الكبير الذي قد يخيفك. المشكلة كلها في التأسيس الصحيح والسير في المسار المضبوط من البداية.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>الأهداف الواقعية:</strong> جملة “تعلم البرمجة في مدة زمنية محددة” هي جملة خيالية. لكن “تعلم أساسيات معينة في مدة زمنية محددة” هو المعنى الحقيقي للهدف. وعندما تحقق هذا الهدف، تنتقل إلى هدف آخر، وهكذا، حتى تبني خبرة معينة وتبدأ مع الوقت في الشعور بالتطور. عندما تقيس الفرق بين ما كنت عليه وما أصبحت عليه، سترى مدى تطورك.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>كانت هذه ببساطة بداية رحلتي في البرمجة. الرحلة لا تزال مستمرة، وما زلت أتعلم حتى الآن. ربما تكون رحلتي مشابهة لرحلتك أو مختلفة عنها تمامًا. قد ترى في هذه الرحلة مسارًا جيدًا يمكنك اتباعه، أو قد تراها أسوأ ما يمكن أن يفعله الإنسان. في النهاية، هذه تجربة شخصية أحببت أن أشاركها معكم.</p>
