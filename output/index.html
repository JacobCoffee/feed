    <h2>String ordering</h2>
    
      
        <p>Is the <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/strings-in-python/" target="_blank">string</a> <code>"apple"</code> greater than the string <code>"animal"</code>?</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="s2">"apple"</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"animal"</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>When I ask this question to a roomful of Python developers, I often see folks mouth L-M-N-O-P.</p>

      
        <p>The word "animal" comes before "apple" in alphabetical ordering.
So <code>"apple"</code> is greater than <code>"animal"</code>:</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="s2">"apple"</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"animal"</span>
<span class="go">True</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>Strings in Python are <strong>ordered alphabetically</strong>.
Well, sort of.</p>

      
        <p>Uppercase <code>"Apple"</code> is less than lowercase <code>"apple"</code>:</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="s2">"Apple"</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="s2">"apple"</span>
<span class="go">True</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>And we can also <strong>order characters that are not in the alphabet</strong>.</p>

      
        <p>For example, the dash character (<code>-</code>) is less than the underscore character (<code>_</code>):</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="s1">'-'</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="s1">'_'</span>
<span class="go">True</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>Each character in a Python string has a number associated with it.
These numbers are the <strong>Unicode code points</strong> for these characters:</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nb">ord</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">c</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">c</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="s2">"apple"</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="go">[97, 112, 112, 108, 101]</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nb">ord</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">c</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">c</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="s2">"animal"</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="go">[97, 110, 105, 109, 97, 108]</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>Python essentially uses alphabetical ordering.</p>

      
        <p>But the alphabet it uses consists of <strong>every possible character</strong>, and <strong>the order</strong> of those characters comes from their <strong>Unicode code points</strong>.</p>

      
        <p>I don't recommend memorizing the <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/unicode-character-encodings-in-python/" target="_blank">Unicode</a> code points of each character.</p>

      
        <p>Instead, I would <strong>lowercase your strings as you order them</strong>.
And keep in mind that <strong>every character counts when you're ordering strings</strong>, even non-alphabetical ones.</p>

      
    
  
    <h2>Lexicographical ordering</h2>
    
      <p><strong>Lexicographical ordering</strong> is a fancy …</p>

            <p>When we learned that the Django Software Foundation has been accepted as a mentoring organization for Google Summer of Code 2026, it marked another steady milestone in a long-standing relationship. Django first participated in GSoC in 2006, and 2026 represents our 21st consecutive year in the program. </p>
<p>Over two decades, GSoC has become a consistent pathway for contributors to engage more deeply with Django — not just through a summer project, but often through continued involvement that extends well beyond the official coding period.</p>
<p>For many of you reading this, this might be your first exposure to how Django’s open source ecosystem works. So before we get into applications and expectations, let’s take a step back and understand the environment you’re stepping into.</p>
<h3 id="s-understanding-the-django-ecosystem">Understanding the Django Ecosystem</h3>
<p>The Django Software Foundation (DSF) is the non-profit organization that supports the long-term sustainability of Django. Django itself is developed entirely in the open. Feature discussions, architectural debates, bug reports, design proposals, and code reviews all happen publicly.</p>
<p>That openness is intentional. It allows anyone, from anywhere in the world, to participate. But it also means decisions are rarely made quickly or casually. Changes are discussed carefully. Trade-offs are evaluated. Backwards compatibility is taken seriously.</p>
<p>If you are new, it helps to understand the main spaces where this work happens:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://forum.djangoproject.com/">Django Forum</a> is where broader discussions take place — new feature ideas, design direction, and community conversations.  </li>
<li><a href="https://code.djangoproject.com/query">Django Trac</a> is the issue tracker, where bugs, feature requests, and patches are formally recorded and reviewed. If no one is working on an issue, you can assign it yourself and start working on it.  </li>
<li>Code contributions happen through <a href="https://github.com/django/django">pull requests</a>, where proposed changes are reviewed, tested, and discussed in detail before being merged.  </li>
<li>New features are proposed and discussed in the <a href="https://github.com/django/new-features/">new-features repository</a>. There is a <a href="https://github.com/orgs/django/projects/24">project board view</a> that shows the state of each proposal.</li>
</ul>
<p>For someone new, this ecosystem can feel overwhelming at first. Threads may reference decisions made years ago. Review comments can be detailed. Standards are high.</p>
<p>That is precisely why GSoC matters to us. It provides a structured entry point into this culture, with mentorship and guidance along the way, helping contributors understand not just how to write code — but how Django evolves.</p>
<h3 id="s-why-the-django-forum-is-central">Why the Django Forum Is Central</h3>
<p>Most GSoC journeys in Django begin on the <a href="https://forum.djangoproject.com/c/internals/mentorship/10">Django Forum</a> — the community’s public space for technical discussions about features, design decisions, and improvements to Django.</p>
<p>Introducing yourself there is not a formality; it is often your first real contribution. When you discuss a project idea publicly, you demonstrate how you think, how you respond to feedback, and how you handle technical trade-offs. Questions and challenges from mentors are not barriers — they are part of the collaborative design process.</p>
<p>Proposals that grow through open discussion on the Forum are almost always stronger than those written in isolation.</p>
<h3 id="s-what-to-do">What To Do</h3>
<p>If you are planning to apply for GSoC 2026 with Django, here is what we strongly encourage:</p>
<p><strong>Start early.</strong><br />
Do not wait until the application window opens. Begin discussions well in advance.</p>
<p><strong>Engage publicly.</strong><br />
Introduce yourself on the <a href="https://forum.djangoproject.com/c/internals/mentorship/10">Forum</a>. Participate in ongoing threads. Show consistent involvement rather than one-time activity.</p>
<p><strong>Demonstrate understanding(very important)</strong><br />
Read related tickets and past discussions. Reference them in your proposal. Show that you understand the technical and philosophical context.</p>
<p><strong>Be realistic about scope.</strong><br />
Ambitious ideas are welcome, but they must be grounded in technical feasibility within the GSoC timeframe.</p>
<p><strong>Show iteration.</strong><br />
If your proposal evolves because of feedback, that is a positive signal. It shows adaptability and thoughtful engagement.</p>
<p><strong>What Not To Do</strong></p>
<p>Equally important are the expectations around what we will not consider.</p>
<p><strong>Do not submit a proposal without prior discussion.</strong><br />
A proposal that appears for the first time in the application form, without any Forum engagement, will be at a disadvantage.</p>
<p><strong>Do not generate a proposal using AI and submit it as-is.</strong><br />
If a proposal is clearly AI-generated, lacks discussion history, and shows no evidence of personal understanding, it will be rejected. We evaluate your reasoning process, not just the surface quality of the document.</p>
<p><strong>Do not copy previous proposals.</strong><br />
Each year’s context is different. We expect original thinking and up-to-date understanding.</p>
<p><strong>Do not treat GSoC as a solo internship.</strong><br />
Django development is collaborative. If you are uncomfortable discussing ideas publicly or receiving detailed feedback, this may not be the right fit.</p>
<p><strong>Do not submit empty or placeholder proposal documents.</strong><br />
In previous years, we have received blank or near-empty submissions, which create unnecessary effort for volunteer reviewers. Such proposals will not be considered.</p>
<p><strong>Do not repeatedly tag or ping maintainers for reviews.</strong><br />
Once you’ve submitted your proposal or patch, give reviewers time to respond. Maintainers are volunteers managing many responsibilities, and repeated tagging does not speed up the process. Patience and respectful follow-ups (after a reasonable interval) are appreciated.</p>
<h3 id="s-on-ai-usage">On AI Usage</h3>
<p>We recognize that AI tools are now part of many developers’ workflows. Using AI to explore documentation, clarify syntax, or organize thoughts is not inherently a problem.</p>
<p>However, AI must not replace ownership.</p>
<p>You should be able to clearly explain your architectural decisions, justify trade-offs, and respond thoughtfully when challenged. If you cannot defend your own proposal without external assistance, it signals a lack of readiness for this kind of work.</p>
<p>The quality we look for is not perfect language — it is depth of understanding.</p>
<h3 id="s-im-a-first-time-contributor-to-django-what-should-i-do">I’m a First-Time Contributor to Django — What Should I Do?</h3>
<p>If this is your first time contributing to Django, start simple and start early.</p>
<p>First, spend some time understanding how Django works as an open source project. Read a few recent discussions on the <a href="https://forum.djangoproject.com">Django Forum</a> and browse <a href="https://code.djangoproject.com/query">open tickets</a> to see the kinds of problems being discussed.</p>
<p>Next, introduce yourself on the Forum. Share your background briefly and mention what areas interest you. You don’t need to have a perfect project idea on day one — curiosity and willingness to learn matter more.</p>
<p>Then:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read the official <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/internals/contributing/new-contributors/">first time contributor guide</a> carefully.   </li>
<li>Try setting up Django locally and run the test suite.  </li>
<li>Look for small tickets on <a href="https://code.djangoproject.com/query">trac</a> (including documentation or cleanup tasks) to understand the workflow.  </li>
<li>Ask questions on the <a href="https://forum.djangoproject.com">Forum</a> or in <a href="https://chat.djangoproject.com">Discord</a> if something is unclear.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most importantly, be patient with yourself. Django is a mature and widely used framework, and it takes time to understand its design principles and contribution standards.</p>
<p>Strong contributors are not the ones who know everything at the start — they are the ones who show up consistently, engage thoughtfully, and improve through feedback.</p>
<h3 id="s-to-conclude">To conclude</h3>
<p>We are excited to welcome a new group of contributors into the Django ecosystem through Google Summer of Code 2026. We look forward to thoughtful ideas, constructive discussions, and a summer of meaningful collaboration — built not just on code, but on understanding and shared responsibility.</p>

            <p>So, let’s rewind a bit. About four years ago, I was looking at <a href="https://github.com/roman-right/beanie">Beanie</a> — this really nifty, Pydantic-based ODM for MongoDB. And as someone who spends an unhealthy amount of time deep in the trenches of ScyllaDB and Cassandra, I had a thought: “Where is <em>my</em> Beanie? I want a hoodie, but for Cassandra.” And thus, the name was born: <strong>coodie</strong> = <strong>c</strong>assandra + beanie (h<strong>oodie</strong>). Catchy, right?</p>

<p>Like any respectable developer, I rushed to GitHub, created the repository <a href="https://github.com/fruch/coodie">fruch/coodie</a>, maybe wrote a highly ambitious <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">README.md</code>, set up a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pyproject.toml</code>, and then… absolutely nothing. Crickets. Life happened. I had CI pipelines to fix, Scylla drivers to maintain, conferences like PyConIL and EuroPython to attend, and live-tweeting to do. coodie just sat there, gathering digital dust, a glorious monument to my good intentions and severe lack of free time.</p>

<h2 id="fast-forward-to-today-the-ai-era">Fast forward to today. The AI era.</h2>

<p>We are living in a weird timeline where LLMs are everywhere, threatening to take our jobs while simultaneously failing to center a div. People are talking about AI coding assistants non-stop. I myself was quite happy with my usual workflow, but I figured — why not take my 4-year-old fever dream for a walk in the park and feed it to the machine?</p>

<p>I threw the basic concept at an AI. I gave it some ground rules: it has to use Pydantic v2, it needs to be backed by <a href="https://github.com/scylladb/python-driver">scylla-driver</a>, and it needs to feel as magical as Beanie.</p>

<p>And holy crap. It actually worked.</p>

<p>I spent four years procrastinating on this, and a glorified autocomplete bot basically bootstrapped the whole thing while I was sipping my morning coffee. I’m not sure if I should be proud of my newfound status as a “prompt engineer,” or slightly terrified that my open-source street cred is now partially owned by a matrix of weights and biases.</p>

<h2 id="the-sweet-setup-we-have-now">The sweet setup we have now</h2>

<p>Despite the AI doing the heavy lifting, the architecture actually makes a lot of sense. Here is what coodie brings to the table:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Pydantic v2 all the way</strong>: Define your documents with full type-checking support.</li>
  <li><strong>Declarative schemas</strong>: You just annotate fields with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PrimaryKey</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ClusteringKey</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Indexed</code>, or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Counter</code>.</li>
  <li><strong>Automatic table management</strong>: You call <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sync_table()</code> and it creates or evolves the table idempotently. No more writing raw CQL just to add a column.</li>
  <li><strong>Sync and Async APIs</strong>: Because why choose? You can use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">coodie.aio</code> if you are riding the asyncio train, or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">coodie.sync</code> if you want blocking code.</li>
  <li><strong>Chainable QuerySets</strong>: Doing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">await Product.find(brand="Acme").limit(10).all()</code> just feels right.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is a quick taste of what the AI and I managed to cook up:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">typing</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">Annotated</span>
<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">uuid</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">UUID</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">uuid4</span>
<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">pydantic</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">Field</span>
<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">coodie</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">Document</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">init_coodie</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">PrimaryKey</span>

<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Product</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Document</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="nb">id</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">Annotated</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">UUID</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">PrimaryKey</span><span class="p">()]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Field</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">default_factory</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">uuid4</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">name</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">str</span>
    <span class="n">price</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">float</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mf">0.0</span>

    <span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Settings</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">keyspace</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">"my_ks"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And then querying it is a breeze:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># async
</span><span class="n">products</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span>
    <span class="k">await</span> <span class="n">Product</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">find</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="p">.</span><span class="nb">filter</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">brand</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">"Acme"</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">.</span><span class="n">order_by</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"price"</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">.</span><span class="n">limit</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">20</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">.</span><span class="nb">all</span><span class="p">()</span>

<p>The AI works out of the box with almost zero friction. It’s very impressive, and honestly, a bit surreal to see an idea you abandoned years ago suddenly have a passing CI suite, complete with tests and GitHub Actions (which are still very tidy to look at, by the way).</p>

<p>You can check out the code, star it, or fork it over at <a href="https://github.com/fruch/coodie">github.com/fruch/coodie</a>.</p>

<p>PRs are welcome. Preferably written by humans, but honestly… I guess I can’t really enforce that anymore, can I? יאללה, let’s see how it goes.</p>

            <p>Generative AI tools becoming more common means that vulnerability reports
these days are <em>loooong</em>. If you're an open source maintainer, you
unfortunately know what I'm talking about. Markdown-formatted, more than five headings,
similar in length to a blog post, and characterized as a
vulnerability worthy of its own domain name.</p>

<p>This makes triaging vulnerabilities by often under-resourced
maintainer more difficult, time-consuming, and stressful.
Whether a report is a genuine vulnerability or not, it now
requires more time from maintainers to make a determination
than is necessary. I've heard from multiple maintainers how specifically
<em>report length</em> weighs negatively on maintainer time, whether these are
“<a href="https://sethmlarson.dev/slop-security-reports">slop vulnerability reports</a>” or just overly-thorough reporters.</p>

<p>Here's my proposal: require security reports respect maintainer time
in your security policy. This especially applies to “initial” security reports,
where the reporter is most likely to send disproportionately more information
than is needed to make an initial determination.</p>

<p>The best part about this framing is you don't have to mention the elephant in
the room. Here's a few example security policy requirements to include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Initial reports must be six or fewer sentences describing the issue
and optionally a short proof-of-concept script. Follow-ups may be longer
if the initial report is deemed a vulnerability.</li>
<li>Initial reports must not contain a severity (such as: "critical") or CVSS score. This calculation
will be completed after the report is accepted by maintainers.</li>
<li>Reports must not make a determination whether a behavior of the software
represents a vulnerability.</li>
</ul>

<p>Notice I didn't even have to mention LLMs or generative AI, so there’s
no ambiguity about whether a given report follows the policy or not.
While you have reporters reading your security policy, you might also add suggestions that also benefit
maintainers remediating vulnerabilities faster:</p>

<ul>
<li>If applicable, submitting a patch or an expected behavior along with a
proof-of-concept makes remediating a vulnerability easier.</li>
<li>We appreciate vulnerability reporters that are willing to review
patches prior to publication.</li>
<li>If you would like to be credited as a reporter, please mention that in your
report.</li>
</ul>

<p>After this is added to a project security policy (preferably under its own linkable heading)
then any security report that doesn't respect maintainer time
can be punted back to the reporter with a canned response:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your report doesn't meet our security policy: https://...
  Please amend your report to meet our policy so we may efficiently
  make a determination and remediation. Thank you!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now your expectations have been made clear to reporters and valuable maintainer
time is saved. From here the security report can evolve more like
a dialogue which requires maintainer time and energy <strong>proportionate
to the value that the report represents to the project</strong>.</p>

<p>I understand this runs counter to how many vulnerability teams work today.
Many reporters opt to provide as much context and detail up-front in a single report,
likely to reduce back-and-forth or push-back from projects.
If teams reporting vulnerabilities to open source projects
want to be the most effective, they should meet the pace and style
that best suites the project they are reporting to.</p>

<p>Please note that <em>many</em> vulnerability reporters are
acting in good faith and aren't trying to burden maintainers. If you believe
your peer is acting in good faith, maybe give them a pass if the report doesn't
<em>strictly</em> meet the requirements and save the canned response for the bigger offenders.</p>

especially not <em>twice a year</em>, unless people really like it. Right
now, it's mostly here to keep with my current writing spree going.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is your bi-yearly reminder that time is changing soon!</p>

<h1 id="whats-happening">What's happening?</h1>

<p>For people not on tor-internal, you should know that I've been sending
semi-regular announcements when daylight saving changes occur. Starting
now, I'm making those announcements public so they can be shared with
the wider community because, after all, this affects everyone (kind of).</p>

<p>For those of you lucky enough to have no idea what I'm talking about,
you should know that some places in the world implement what is called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time">Daylight saving time or DST</a>.</p>

<p>Normally, you shouldn't have to do anything: computers automatically
change time following local rules, assuming they are correctly
configured, provided recent updates have been applied in the case of a
recent change in said rules (because yes, this happens).</p>

<p>Appliances, of course, will likely <em>not</em> change time and will need to
adjusted unless they are so-called "smart" (also known as "part of a bot
net").</p>

<p>If your clock is flashing "0:00" or "12:00", you have no action to take,
congratulations on having the right time once or twice a day.</p>

<p>If you haven't changed those clocks in six months, congratulations, they
will be accurate again!</p>

<p>In any case, you should still consider DST because it might affect some
of your meeting schedules, particularly if you set up a new meeting
schedule in the last 6 months and forgot to consider this
change.</p>

<h1 id="if-your-location-does-not-have-dst">If your location does not have DST</h1>

<p>Properly scheduled meetings affecting multiple time zones are set in UTC
time, which does <em>not</em> change. So if your location does not observer
time changes, your (local!) meeting time will <em>not</em> change.</p>

<p>But be aware that some other folks attending your meeting <em>might</em> have
the DST bug and <em>their</em> meeting times will change. They might miss
entire meetings or arrive late as you frantically ping them over IRC,
Matrix, Signal, SMS, Ricochet, Mattermost, SimpleX, Whatsapp, Discord,
Slack, Wechat, Snapchat, Telegram, XMPP, Briar, Zulip, RocketChat,
DeltaChat, talk(1), write(1), actual telegrams, Meshtastic, Meshcore,
Reticulum, APRS, snail mail, and, finally, flying a remote presence
drone to their house, asking what's going on.</p>

<p>(Sorry if I forgot your preferred messaging client here, I tried my
best.)</p>

<p>Be kind; those poor folks might be more sleep deprived as DST <em>steals</em>
one hour of sleep from them on the night that implements the change.</p>

<h1 id="if-you-do-observe-dst">If you do observe DST</h1>

<p>If you are affected by the DST bug, your <em>local</em> meeting times <em>will</em>
change access the board. Normally, you can trust that your meetings are
scheduled to take this change into account and the new time should still
be reasonable.</p>

<p>Trust, but verify; make sure the new times <em>are</em> adequate and there are
no scheduling conflicts.</p>

<p>Do this <em>now</em>: take a look at your calendar in two week <em>and</em> in
April. See if any meeting need to be rescheduled because of an
impossible or conflicting time.</p>

<h1 id="when-does-time-change-how-and-where">When does time change, how and where?</h1>

<p>Notice how I mentioned "North America" in the subject? That's a
lie. ("The doctor lies", as they say on the BBC.) Other places,
including Europe, also changes times, just not all at once (and not all
North America).</p>

<p>We'll get into "where" soon, but first let's look at the "how". As you might
already know, the trick is:</p>

<blockquote><p>Spring forward, fall backwards.</p></blockquote>

<p>This northern-centric (sorry!) proverb says that clocks will move
<em>forward</em> by an hour this "spring", after moving <em>backwards</em> last
"fall". This is why we lose an hour of work, sorry, sleep. It sucks, to
put it bluntly. I want it to stop and will keep writing those advisories
until it does.</p>

<p>To see where and when, we, unfortunately, still need to go into politics.</p>

<h2 id="usa-and-canada">USA and Canada</h2>

<p>First, we start with "North America" which, really, is just some <em>parts</em>
of USA[1] and Canada[2]. As usual, on the Second Sunday in March (the
8th) at 02:00 local (not UTC!), the clocks will move forward.</p>

<p>This means that properly set clocks will flip from 1:59 to 3:00, coldly
depriving us from an hour of sleep that was perniciously granted 6
months ago and making calendar software stupidly hard to write.</p>

<p>Practically, set your wrist watch and alarm clocks[3] back one hour
before going to bed and go to bed early.</p>

<p>[1] except Arizona (except the Navajo nation), US territories, and
    Hawaii</p>

<p>[2] except Yukon, most of Saskatchewan, and parts of British Columbia
    (northeast), one island in Nunavut (Southampton Island), one town in
    Ontario (Atikokan) and small parts of Quebec (Le
    Golfe-du-Saint-Laurent), a list which I keep recopying because I
    find it just so amazing how chaotic it is. When your clock has its
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_Saskatchewan">own Wikipedia page</a>, you know something is wrong.</p>

<p>[3] hopefully not managed by a botnet, otherwise kindly ask your bot net
    operator to apply proper software upgrades in a timely manner</p>

<h2 id="europe">Europe</h2>

<p>Next we look at our dear Europe, which will change time on the last
Sunday in March (the 29th) at 01:00 <em>UTC</em> (not local!). I <em>think</em> it
means that, Amsterdam-time, the clocks will flip from 1:59 to 3:00 AM
<em>local</em> on that night.</p>

<p>(Every time I write this, I have doubts. I would welcome independent
confirmation from night owls that observe that funky behavior
experimentally.)</p>

<p>Just like your poor fellows out west, just fix your old-school clocks
before going to bed, and go to sleep early, it's good for you.</p>

<h2 id="rest-of-the-world-with-dst">Rest of the world with DST</h2>

<p>Renewed and recurring apologies again to the people of Cuba, Mexico,
Moldova, Israel, Lebanon, Palestine, Egypt, Chile (except Magallanes
Region), parts of Australia, and New Zealand which <em>all</em> have their own
<em>individual</em> DST rules, omitted here for brevity.</p>

<p>In general, changes also happen in March, but either on different
times or different days, except in the south hemisphere, where they
happen in April.</p>

<h2 id="rest-of-the-world-without-dst">Rest of the world without DST</h2>

<p>All of you other folks without DST, rejoice! Thank you for reminding us
how manage calendars and clocks normally. Sometimes, doing nothing is
precisely the right thing to do. You're an inspiration for us all.</p>

<h1 id="changes-since-last-time">Changes since last time</h1>

<p>There were, again, no changes since last year on daylight savings that
I'm aware of. It seems the <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2026/02/19/daylight-act-of-2026-proposing-half-daylight-saving-time/88760725007/">US congress debating switching to a
"half-daylight" time zone</a> which is an half-baked idea that I
should have expected from the current USA politics.</p>

<p>The plan is to, say, switch from "Eastern is UTC-4 in the summer" to
"Eastern is UTC-4.5". The bill also proposes to do this 90 days after
enactment, which is dangerously optimistic about our capacity at
deploying any significant change in human society.</p>

<p>In general, I rely on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time_by_country">Wikipedia time nerds</a> for this and Paul
Eggert which seems to singlehandledly be keeping everything in order
for all of us, on the <a href="https://lists.iana.org/hyperkitty/list/tz-announce@iana.org/latest">tz-announce mailing list</a>.</p>

<p>This time, I've also looked at the <a href="https://lists.iana.org/hyperkitty/list/tz@iana.org/latest">tz mailing list</a> which is where
I learned about the congress bill.</p>

<p>If your country has changed time and no one above noticed, now would
be an extremely late time to do something about this, typically
writing to the above list. (Incredibly, <em>I</em> need to write to the list
because of <a href="https://lists.iana.org/hyperkitty/list/tz@iana.org/thread/6HN5SWD2BJA7OVTPFR3VB42JIA6PFLPG/">this post</a>.)</p>

<p>One thing that <em>did</em> change since last year is that I've implemented
what I hope to be a robust calendar for this, which was surprisingly
tricky.</p>

<p>If you have access to our Nextcloud, it should be visible under the
heading "Daylight saving times". If you don't, you can access it using
<a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/tpa/team/-/wikis/howto/time/dst.ics">this direct link</a>.</p>

<p>The procedures around how this calendar was created, how this email
was written, and curses found along the way, are also documented in
<a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/tpa/team/-/wikis/howto/time">this wiki page</a>, if someone ever needs to pick up the Time Lord
duty.</p>

<p><strong>Brian #1: <a href="https://pydantic.dev/articles/inline-snapshot?featured_on=pythonbytes">Better Python tests with inline-snapshot</a></strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Alex Hall, on Pydantic blog</li>
<li>Great for testing complex data structures</li>
<li><p>Allows you to write a test like this:</p>

<div class="codehilite">
<pre><span></span><code><span class="n">from</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">inline_snapshot</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">import</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">snapshot</span>

</code></pre>
</div></li>
<li><p>Then run <code>pytest --inline-snapshot=fix</code></p></li>
<li><p>And the library updates the test source code to look like this:</p>

<div class="codehilite">
<pre><span></span><code><span class="n">def</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">test_user_creation</span><span class="err">():</span>

</code></pre>

<p><strong>Michael #4: <a href="https://github.com/nektos/act?featured_on=pythonbytes">act - run your GitHub actions locally</a></strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Run your <a href="https://developer.github.com/actions/?featured_on=pythonbytes">GitHub Actions</a> locally! Why would you want to do this? Two reasons:
<ul>
<li><strong>Fast Feedback</strong> - Rather than having to commit/push every time you want to test out the changes you are making to your <code>.github/workflows/</code> files (or for any changes to embedded GitHub actions), you can use <code>act</code> to run the actions locally. The <a href="https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/using-environment-variables#default-environment-variables">environment variables</a> and <a href="https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/virtual-environments-for-github-hosted-runners#filesystems-on-github-hosted-runners">filesystem</a> are all configured to match what GitHub provides.</li>
<li><strong>Local Task Runner</strong> - I love <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)?featured_on=pythonbytes">make</a>. However, I also hate repeating myself. With <code>act</code>, you can use the GitHub Actions defined in your <code>.github/workflows/</code> to replace your <code>Makefile</code>!</li>
</ul></li>
<li>When you run <code>act</code> it reads in your GitHub Actions from <code>.github/workflows/</code> and determines the set of actions that need to be run.
<ul>
<li>Uses the Docker API to either pull or build the necessary images, as defined in your workflow files and finally determines the execution path based on the dependencies that were defined.</li>
<li>Once it has the execution path, it then uses the Docker API to run containers for each action based on the images prepared earlier.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/using-environment-variables#default-environment-variables">environment variables</a> and <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners#file-systems">filesystem</a> are all configured to match what GitHub provides.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

            Introduction Over the past ten years or so, my role has gradually shifted from software to platforms. More towards the &lsquo;ops&rsquo; side of things, but coming from a background that values APIs, automation, artifacts and guardrails in the form of automated tests.
And I found out that a lot of best practices from software engineering can be adapted and applied to modern ops practices as well.
DevOps in a nutshell really: Bridging the gap between Dev and Ops.

            <p>في 2026، لم يعد المستخدم العادي يبحث عن موقع إلكتروني “يعمل” فقط، بل يبحث عن تجربة “تُدهشه” وتتفاعل معه. الفرق بين تطبيق ناجح وآخر منسي يكمن غالبًا في جودة هذه التجربة: هل الواجهة سهلة وممتعة؟ هل البيانات المعقدة معروضة بشكل بسيط وجذاب؟</p>

<p>هنا يظهر دور جديد ومطلوب بشدة في سوق العمل: <strong>صانع التجارب التفاعلية</strong>. هذا ليس مجرد مطور واجهة أمامية، بل هو فنان رقمي ومهندس يجمع بين دقة البرمجة، وإبداع التصميم، وقوة سرد القصص عبر البيانات.</p>

<p>هذه التدوينة هي خارطة طريقك العملية لتصبح هذا الشخص. لقد اخترنا لك 5 شهادات مجانية متكاملة، تعمل معًا لتمنحك المهارات التقنية والإبداعية اللازمة لبناء تجارب رقمية لا تُنسى.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="خارطة-الطريق-لبناء-التجارب-التفاعلية"><strong>خارطة الطريق لبناء التجارب التفاعلية</strong></h3>

<p>تتكون رحلتك من أربع خطوات أساسية، كل خطوة تبني على التي قبلها لتكوين مجموعة مهارات فريدة.</p>

<h4 id="الخطوة-الأولى-بناء-اللوحة-القماشية---إتقان-أساسيات-الويب"><strong>الخطوة الأولى: بناء اللوحة القماشية - إتقان أساسيات الويب</strong></h4>

<p>قبل أن ترسم تحفتك الفنية، تحتاج إلى لوحة قماشية وألوان أساسية. في عالم الويب، هذه الأساسيات هي HTML و CSS و JavaScript.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>الشهادة المقترحة (1):</strong> <strong>Responsive Web Design</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>لماذا هذه الشهادة؟</strong> لأنها تعلمك كيفية بناء هيكل صفحات الويب (HTML) وتصميمها بشكل جميل ومتجاوب مع جميع الشاشات (CSS). ستبني 5 مشاريع حقيقية لترسيخ هذه المهارة.</li>
      <li><strong>المقدم:</strong> freeCodeCamp</li>
      <li><strong>لغة الدورة:</strong> المحتوى الأساسي باللغة الإنجليزية.</li>
      <li><strong>👈 <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/">ابدأ ببناء لوحتك القماشية من هنا</a></strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>الشهادة المقترحة (2):</strong> <strong>JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>لماذا هذه الشهادة؟</strong> لأنها تمنحك “الألوان الحية” - لغة JavaScript. هي التي تضيف التفاعل والمنطق والروح إلى صفحات الويب الثابتة، وهي أساس كل الخطوات التالية.</li>

<h4 id="الخطوة-الثانية-إضافة-الحركة-والحياة---بناء-الواجهات-الديناميكية"><strong>الخطوة الثانية: إضافة الحركة والحياة - بناء الواجهات الديناميكية</strong></h4>

<p>الآن بعد أن أتقنت الأساسيات، حان الوقت لتعلم الأدوات الحديثة التي تبني بها التطبيقات السريعة والمعقدة التي نراها اليوم.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>الشهادة المقترحة:</strong> <strong>Front-End Development Libraries</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>لماذا هذه الشهادة؟</strong> لأنها تركز على <strong>React</strong>، أشهر مكتبة لبناء واجهات المستخدم في العالم. تعلمك React سيسمح لك ببناء تطبيقات أحادية الصفحة (SPAs) سريعة ومعقدة بسهولة، وهي المهارة الأساسية لأي مطور واجهة أمامية حديث.</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="الخطوة-الثالثة-جعل-البيانات-تنطق---فن-تصور-البيانات"><strong>الخطوة الثالثة: جعل البيانات تنطق - فن تصور البيانات</strong></h4>

<p>هذه هي الخطوة التي تميزك حقًا وتجعلك “صانع تجارب”. هنا تحول الأرقام والبيانات الجافة إلى قصص مرئية تفاعلية ومفهومة.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>الشهادة المقترحة:</strong> <strong>Data Visualization</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>لماذا هذه الشهادة؟</strong> لأنها تعلمك استخدام مكتبة <strong>D3.js</strong>، وهي الأداة الأقوى في العالم لإنشاء تصورات بيانات مخصصة وتفاعلية على الويب. لن تكون مقيدًا بالرسوم البيانية التقليدية، بل ستتمكن من بناء أي شيء يخطر ببالك، من الخرائط التفاعلية إلى المخططات المتحركة.</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="الخطوة-الرابعة-التفكير-بعقل-المستخدم---أساسيات-تجربة-المستخدم-ux"><strong>الخطوة الرابعة: التفكير بعقل المستخدم - أساسيات تجربة المستخدم (UX)</strong></h4>

<p>اللمسة الأخيرة التي تجمع كل شيء معًا هي فهم احتياجات المستخدم. تطبيق جميل تقنيًا ولكنه صعب الاستخدام هو تطبيق فاشل.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>الشهادة المقترحة:</strong> <strong>Google UX Design Professional Certificate</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>لماذا هذه الشهادة؟</strong> لست بحاجة لأن تصبح مصممًا محترفًا، لكن فهمك لمبادئ تجربة المستخدم (UX) من هذه الشهادة المرموقة سيغير طريقة تفكيرك إلى الأبد. ستتعلم كيفية تنظيم المعلومات، تسهيل التنقل، وبناء منتجات يحبها الناس ويستمتعون باستخدامها.</li>

            You love building web apps with Python, and HTMX got you excited about the hypermedia approach -- let the server drive the HTML, skip the JavaScript build step, keep things simple. But then you hit that last 10%: You need Alpine.js for interactivity, your state gets out of sync, and suddenly you're juggling two unrelated libraries that weren't designed to work together.  What if there was a single 11-kilobyte framework that gave you everything HTMX and Alpine do, and more, with real-time updates, multiplayer collaboration out of the box, and performance so fast you're actually bottlenecked by the monitor's refresh rate? That's Datastar.  On this episode, I sit down with its creator Delaney Gillilan, core maintainer Ben Croker, and Datastar convert Chris May to explore how this backend-driven, server-sent-events-first framework is changing the way full-stack developers think about the modern web.

<p>Let’s spend some time getting to know Baptiste better!</p>
<h4 id="s-can-you-tell-us-a-little-about-yourself-hobbies-education-etc">Can you tell us a little about yourself? (hobbies, education, etc)</h4>
<p>I'm a French immigrant living in Norway. In the day time I work as software engineer at <a href="https://torchbox.com/">Torchbox</a> building Django and Wagtail sites.
Education-wise I'm a "self-taught" (whatever that means) developer and started working when I was very young.
In terms of hobbies, I'm a big language nerd and I'm always up for a good etymology fact. I also enjoy the outdoor whether it's on a mountain bike or on foot (still not convinced by this skiing thing they do in Norway, but I'm trying).</p>
<h4 id="s-how-did-you-start-using-django">How did you start using Django?</h4>
<p>I was working in a startup where I had built an unmaintainable pile of custom framework-less PHP code. I'd heard of this cool Python framework and thought it would help me bring some structure to our codebase. So I started rewriting our services bit-by-bit and eventually switched everything to Django after about a year.</p>
<p>In 2012, I bought a ticket to DjangoCon Europe in Zurich and went there not knowing anyone. It was one of the best decisions of my life: the Django community welcomed me and has given me so much over the years.</p>
<h4 id="s-what-other-framework-do-you-know-and-if-there-is-anything-you-would-like-to-have-in-django-if-you-had-magical-powers">What other framework do you know and if there is anything you would like to have in Django if you had magical powers?</h4>
<p>I've been making website for more than two decades now, so I've used my fair share of various technologies and frameworks, but Django is still my "daily driver" and the one I like the best. I like writing plain CSS, and when I need some extra bit of JS I like to use Alpine JS and/or HTMX: I find they work really well together with Django.</p>
<p>If I had magical powers and could change anything, I would remove the word "patch" from existence (and especially from the Django documentation).</p>
<h4 id="s-what-projects-are-you-working-on-now">What projects are you working on now?</h4>
<p>I don't have any big projects active at the moment, I'm mostly working on client projects at work.</p>
<h4 id="s-which-django-libraries-are-your-favorite-core-or-3rd-party">Which Django libraries are your favorite (core or 3rd party)?</h4>
<p>My favorite Django library of all time is possibly <a href="https://pypi.org/project/django-admin-dracula/">django-admin-dracula</a>. It's the perfect combination of professional and whimsical for me.</p>
<p>Other than that I'm also a big fan of the <a href="https://wagtail.org/">Wagtail CMS</a>. I've been learning more and more about it in the past year and I've really been liking it. The code feels very Django-y and the community around it is lovely as well.</p>
<h4 id="s-what-are-the-top-three-things-in-django-that-you-like">What are the top three things in Django that you like?</h4>
<p>1) First of course is the people. I know it's a cliche but the community is what makes Django so special.</p>
<p>2) In terms of the framework, what brought me to it in the first place was its opinionated structure and settings. When I started working with Django I didn't really know much about web development, but Django's standard project structure and excellent defaults meant that I could just use things out of the box knowing I was building something solid. And more than that, as my skills and knowledge grew I was able to swap out those defaults with some more custom things that worked better for me. There's room to grow and the transition has always felt very smooth for me.</p>
<p>3) And if I had to pick a single feature, then I'd go for one that I think is underrated: <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/testing/tools/#django.test.TransactionTestCase.assertQuerySetEqual"><code>assertQuerySetEqual()</code></a>. I think more people should be using it!</p>
<h4 id="s-what-is-it-like-to-be-in-the-ops-team">What is it like to be in the Ops team?</h4>
<p>It's both very exciting and very boring 😅</p>
<p>Most of the tasks we do are very mundane: create DNS records, update a server, deploy a fix.
But because we have access and control over a big part of the infrastructure that powers the Django community, it's also a big responsibility which we don't take lightly.</p>
<h4 id="s-i-know-you-were-one-of-the-first-members-of-the-django-girls-foundation-board-of-directors-thats-amazing-how-did-that-start-for-you">I know you were one of the first members of the Django Girls Foundation board of directors. That's amazing! How did that start for you?</h4>
<p>By 2014 I'd become good friend with Ola &amp; Ola and in July they asked me to be a coach at the very first Django Girls workshop at EuroPython in Berlin. The energy at that event was amazing an unlike any other event I'd been a part of, so I got hooked. </p>
<p>I went on to coach at many other workshops after that. When Ola &amp; Ola had the idea to start an official entity for Django Girls, they needed a token white guy and I gladly accepted the role!</p>
<h4 id="s-you-co-created-django-under-the-hood-series-which-from-what-ive-heard-was-very-successful-at-the-time-can-you-tell-us-a-little-more-about-this-conference-and-its-beginnings">You co-created Django Under the Hood series which, from what I've heard, was very successful at the time. Can you tell us a little more about this conference and its beginnings?</h4>
<p>I'm still really proud of having been on that team and of what we achieved with this conference. So many stories to tell!</p>
<p>I believe it all started at the <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2014/mar/17/announcing-djangovillage/">Django Village conference</a> where Marc Tamlin and I were looking for ideas for how to bring the Django core team together. </p>
<p>We thought that having a conference would be a good way to give an excuse (and raise funds) for people to travel all to the same place and work on Django. Somehow we decided that Amsterdam was the perfect place for that. </p>
<p>Then we were extremely lucky that a bunch of talented folks actually turned that idea into a reality: Sasha, Ola, Tomek, Ola, Remco, Kasia (and many others) 💖.</p>
<h4 id="s-as-a-former-conference-organizer-and-volunteer-do-you-have-any-recommendations-for-those-who-want-to-contribute-or-organize-a-conference">As a former conference organizer and volunteer, do you have any recommendations for those who want to contribute or organize a conference?</h4>
<p>I think our industry (and even the world in general) is in a very different place today than a decade ago when I was actively organizing conferences. Honestly I'm not sure it would be as easy today to do the things we've done.</p>
<p>My recommendation is to do it if you can. I've forged some real friendships in my time as an organizer, and as exhausting and stressful as it can be, it's also immensely rewarding in its own way.</p>
<p>The hard lesson I'd also give is that you should pay attention to who gets to come to your events, and more importantly who doesn't. Organizing a conference is essentially making a million decisions, most of which are really boring. But every decision you make has an effect when it's combined with all the others. The food you serve or don't serve, the time of year your event takes place, its location. Whether you spend your budget on fun tshirts, or on travel grants. </p>
<p>All of it makes a difference somehow.</p>
<h4 id="s-do-you-remember-your-first-contribution-in-django">Do you remember your first contribution in Django?</h4>
<p>I do! It was commit <a href="https://github.com/django/django/commit/ac8eb82abb23f7ae50ab85100619f13257b03526">ac8eb82abb23f7ae50ab85100619f13257b03526</a>: a one character typo fix in an error message 😂</p>
<h4 id="s-is-there-anything-else-youd-like-to-say">Is there anything else you’d like to say?</h4>
<p>Open source is made of people, not code. You'll never go wrong by investing in your community. Claude will never love you back.</p>

            <p>Last month <a href="https://forum.djangoproject.com/t/updating-the-code-of-conduct/43924">we announced our plan</a> to adopt <a href="https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/3/0/code_of_conduct/">Contributor Covenant 3</a> as Django's new Code of Conduct through a multi-step process. Today we're excited to share that we've completed the first step of that journey!</p>
<h4 id="s-what-weve-done">What We've Done</h4>
<p>We've merged <a href="https://github.com/django/code-of-conduct/blob/main/updates.md">new documentation</a> that outlines how any member of the Django community can propose changes to our Code of Conduct and related policies. This creates a transparent, community-driven process for keeping our policies current and relevant.</p>
<p>The new process includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Proposing Changes</strong>: Anyone can <a href="https://github.com/django/code-of-conduct/issues/new?template=coc-change-proposal.md">open an issue</a> with a clear description of their proposed change and the rationale behind it.</li>
<li><strong>Community Review</strong>: The Code of Conduct Working Group will discuss proposals in our monthly meetings and may solicit broader community feedback through the forum, Discord, or DSF Slack.</li>
<li><strong>Approval and Announcement</strong>: Once consensus is reached, changes are merged and announced to the community. Changes to the Code of Conduct itself will be sent to the DSF Board for final approval.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="s-how-you-can-get-involved">How You Can Get Involved</h4>
<p>We welcome and encourage participation from everyone in the Django community! Here's how you can engage with this process:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Share Your Ideas</strong>: If you have suggestions for improving our Code of Conduct or related documentation, <a href="https://github.com/django/code-of-conduct/issues/new?template=coc-change-proposal.md">open an issue</a> on our GitHub repo.</li>
<li><strong>Join the Discussion</strong>: Participate in community discussions about proposed changes on the forum, Discord, or DSF Slack. Keep it positive, constructive, and respectful.</li>
<li><strong>Stay Informed</strong>: Watch the <a href="https://github.com/django/code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct repository</a> to follow along with proposed changes and discussions.</li>
<li><strong>Provide Feedback</strong>: Not comfortable with GitHub? You can also reach out via <a href="mailto:conduct@djangoproject.com">conduct@djangoproject.com</a>, or look for anyone with the <code>Code of Conduct WG</code> role on Discord.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="s-whats-next">What's Next</h4>
<p>We're moving forward with the remaining steps of our plan:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Step 2</strong> (target: March 15): Update our <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/conduct/enforcement-manual/">Enforcement Manual</a>, <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/conduct/reporting/">Reporting Guidelines</a>, and <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/conduct/faq/">FAQs</a> via <a href="https://github.com/django/code-of-conduct/pull/91">pull request 91</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Step 3</strong> (target: April 15): Adopt the Contributor Covenant 3 with proposed changes from the working group.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each step will have its own pull request where the community can review and provide feedback before we merge. We're committed to taking the time needed to incorporate your input thoughtfully.</p>
<p>Thank you for being part of this important work to make Django a more welcoming and inclusive community for everyone!</p>

            <p>This is also known as: "<code>ifconfig</code> is not installed by default
anymore, how do I do this only with the <code>ip</code> command?"</p>

<p>I have been slowly training my brain to use the new commands but I
sometimes forget some. So, here's a couple of equivalence from the old
package to <code>net-tools</code> the new <code>iproute2</code>, about 10 years late:</p>

<table class="table">
<thead>
<tr>
<th> <code>net-tools</code>                 </th>
<th> <code>iproute2</code>                                   </th>
<th> shorter form                 </th>
<th> what it does                            </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td> <code>arp -an</code>                   </td>
<td> <code>ip neighbor</code>                                </td>
<td> <code>ip n</code>                       </td>
<td>                                         </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> <code>ifconfig</code>                  </td>
<td> <code>ip address</code>                                 </td>
<td> <code>ip a</code>                       </td>

<td> <code>ip l</code>                       </td>
<td> show link stats (up/down/packet counts) </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> <code>route</code>                     </td>
<td> <code>ip route</code>                                   </td>
<td> <code>ip r</code>                       </td>
<td> show or modify the routing table        </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> <code>route add default GATEWAY</code> </td>
<td> <code>ip route add default via GATEWAY</code>           </td>
<td> <code>ip r a default via GATEWAY</code> </td>
<td> add default route to <code>GATEWAY</code>          </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> <code>route del ROUTE</code>           </td>
<td> <code>ip route del ROUTE</code>                         </td>
<td> <code>ip r d ROUTE</code>               </td>
<td> remove <code>ROUTE</code> (e.g. <code>default</code>)         </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> <code>netstat -anpe</code>             </td>
<td> <code>ss --all --numeric  --processes --extended</code> </td>
<td> <code>ss -anpe</code>                   </td>
<td> list listening processes, less pretty   </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>Note that I wrote a <a href="https://anarc.at/blog/2023-03-10-listening-processes/">whole
article</a> about the latter.</p>

<h1 id="another-trick">Another trick</h1>

<p>Also note that I often alias <code>ip</code> to <code>ip -br -c</code> as it provides a
much prettier output.</p>

<p>Compare, before:</p>

<pre><code>anarcat@angela:~&gt; ip a
1: lo: &lt;LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
    inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 ::1/128 scope host noprefixroute 
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
2: wlan0: &lt;NO-CARRIER,BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state DOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/ether xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff permaddr xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx
    altname wlp166s0
    altname wlx8cf8c57333c7
4: virbr0: &lt;NO-CARRIER,BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state DOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/ether xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 192.168.122.1/24 brd 192.168.122.255 scope global virbr0
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
20: eth0: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP group default qlen 1000
    link/ether xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 192.168.0.108/24 brd 192.168.0.255 scope global dynamic noprefixroute eth0
       valid_lft 40699sec preferred_lft 40699sec
</code></pre>

<p>After:</p>

<pre><code>anarcat@angela:~&gt; ip -br -c a
lo               UNKNOWN        127.0.0.1/8 ::1/128 
wlan0            DOWN           
virbr0           DOWN           192.168.122.1/24 
eth0             UP             192.168.0.108/24 
</code></pre>

<p>I don't even need to redact MAC addresses! It also affects the display
of the other commands, which look similarly neat.</p>

<p>Also imagine pretty colors above.</p>

<p>Finally, I don't have a cheat sheet for <code>iw</code> vs <code>iwconfig</code> (from
<code>wireless-tools</code>) yet. I just use NetworkManager now and rarely have
to mess with wireless interfaces directly.</p>

<h1 id="background-and-history">Background and history</h1>

<p>For context, there are traditionally two ways of configuring the
network in Linux:</p>

<ul>
<li>the old way, with commands like <code>ifconfig</code>, <code>arp</code>, <code>route</code> and
<code>netstat</code>, those are part of the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/net-tools/">net-tools</a> package</li>
<li>the new way, mostly (but not entirely!) wrapped in a single <code>ip</code>
command, that is the <a href="https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/networking/iproute2">iproute2</a> package</li>
</ul>


<p>It seems like the latter was made "important" in Debian <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=487533">in 2008</a>,
which means every release since Debian 5 "lenny" <img alt="(!)" src="https://anarc.at/smileys/idea.png" /> has featured the
<code>ip</code> command.</p>

<p>The former <code>net-tools</code> package was <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2016/12/msg00775.html">demoted in December 2016</a> which
means every release since Debian 9 "stretch" ships <em>without</em> an
<code>ifconfig</code> command unless explicitly requested. Note that this was
mentioned <a href="https://www.debian.org/releases/stretch/amd64/release-notes">in the release notes</a> in a similar (but, IMHO, less
useful) table.</p>

<p>(Technically, the <code>net-tools</code> Debian package source still indicates it
is <code>Priority: important</code> but that's <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1128342">a bug I have just filed</a>.)</p>

<p>Finally, and perhaps more importantly, the name <code>iproute</code> is hilarious
if you are a bilingual french speaker: it can be read as "I proute"
which can be interpreted as "I fart" as "prout!" is the sound a fart
makes. The fact that it's called <code>iproute2</code> makes it only more
hilarious.</p>
