            <p>We are looking for the next group of organizers to own and lead the 2026 DjangoCon Europe conference. Could your town - or your football stadium, circus tent, private island or city hall - host this wonderful community event?</p>
<p>DjangoCon Europe is a major pillar of the Django community, as people from across the world meet and share. This includes many qualities that make it a unique event - unconventional and conventional venues, creative happenings, a feast of talks and a dedication to inclusion and diversity.</p>
<p>Hosting a DjangoCon is an ambitious undertaking. It's hard work, but each year it has been successfully run by a team of community volunteers, not all of whom have had previous experience - more important is enthusiasm, organizational skills, the ability to plan and manage budgets, time and people - and plenty of time to invest in the project.</p>
<p>For 2026, we want to kickstart the organization much earlier than in previous years to allow more flexibility for the organizing team, and open up more opportunities for support from our <a href="https://github.com/django/dsf-working-groups/blob/main/active/dceu.md">DjangoCon Europe support working group</a>.</p>
<h2 id="step-1-submit-your-expression-of-interest">Step 1: Submit your expression of interest</h2>
<p>If you’re considering organizing DjangoCon Europe (🙌 great!), fill in our<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf_uFodt6nHghd7uCpQnaCVVT2Rcc2-53c7NTG59iGSFCcxYw/viewform"> DjangoCon Europe 2026 expression of interest form</a> with your contact details. No need to fill in all the information at this stage if you don’t have it all already, we’ll reach out and help you figure it out.</p>
<p><a class="cta" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf_uFodt6nHghd7uCpQnaCVVT2Rcc2-53c7NTG59iGSFCcxYw/viewform">Express your interest in organizing</a></p>
<h2 id="step-2-we-re-here-to-help">Step 2: We’re here to help!</h2>
<p>We've set up a<a href="https://github.com/django/dsf-working-groups/blob/main/active/dceu.md"> DjangoCon Europe support working group</a> of previous organizers that you can reach out to with questions about organizing and running a DjangoCon Europe.</p>
<p>The group will be in touch with everyone submitting the expression of interest form, or you can reach out to them directly: european-organizers-support@djangoproject.com</p>
<p>We'd love to hear from you as soon as possible, so your proposal can be finalized and sent to the DSF board by October 6th 2024. The selected hosts will be publicly announced at <a href="https://2025.djangocon.eu/">DjangoCon Europe 2025</a> by the current organizers.</p>
<h2 id="step-3-submitting-the-proposal">Step 3: Submitting the proposal</h2>
<p>The more detailed and complete your final proposal is, the better. Basic details include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Organizing committee members: You won’t have a full team yet, probably, naming just some core team members is enough.</li>
<li>The legal entity that is intended to run the conference: Even if the entity does not exist yet, please share how you are planning to set it up.</li>
<li>Dates: See “What dates are possible in 2026?” below. We must avoid conflicts with major holidays, EuroPython, DjangoCon US, and PyCon US.</li>
<li>Venue(s), including size, number of possible attendees, pictures, accessibility concerns, catering, etc.</li>
<li>Transport links and accommodation: Can your venue be reached by international travelers?</li>
<li>Budgets and ticket prices: Talk to the DjangoCon Europe Support group to get help with this, including information on past event budgets.</li>
</ul>
<p>We also like to see:</p>
<ul>
<li>Timelines</li>
<li>Pictures</li>
<li>Plans for online participation, and other ways to make the event more inclusive and reduce its environmental footprint</li>
<li>Draft agreements with providers</li>
<li>Alternatives you have considered</li>
</ul>
<p>Have a look at our proposed <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hegUjHc-ifEN9W9VI-8ekOZFHXkBOKY1FOeREgeD1JE/edit?usp=sharing">DjangoCon Europe 2026 Licensing Agreement</a> for the fine print on contractual requirements and involvement of the Django Software Foundation.</p>
<p>Submit your completed proposal by October 6th 2024 via our<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf_uFodt6nHghd7uCpQnaCVVT2Rcc2-53c7NTG59iGSFCcxYw/viewform?usp=sf_link"> DjangoCon Europe 2026 expression of interest form</a>, this time filling in as many fields as possible. We look forward to reviewing great proposals that continue the excellence the whole community associates with DjangoCon Europe.</p>
<h2 id="q-a">Q&amp;A</h2>
<h3 id="can-i-organize-a-conference-alone">Can I organize a conference alone?</h3>
<p>We strongly recommend that a team of people submit an application.</p>
<h3 id="i-we-don-t-have-a-legal-entity-yet-is-that-a-problem-">I/we don’t have a legal entity yet, is that a problem?</h3>
<p>Depending on your jurisdiction, this is usually not a problem. But please share your plans about the entity you will use or form in your application.</p>
<h3 id="do-i-we-need-experience-with-organizing-conferences">Do I/we need experience with organizing conferences?</h3>
<p>The support group is here to help you succeed. From experience, we know that many core groups of 2-3 people have been able to run a DjangoCon with guidance from previous organizers and help from volunteers.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-required-in-order-to-announce-an-event">What is required in order to announce an event?</h3>
<p>Ultimately, a contract with the venue confirming the dates is crucial, since announcing a conference makes people book calendars, holidays, buy transportation and accommodation etc. This, however, would only be relevant after the DSF board has concluded the application process. Naturally, the application itself cannot contain any guarantees, but it’s good to check concrete dates with your venues to ensure they are actually open and currently available, before suggesting these dates in the application.</p>
<h3 id="do-we-have-to-do-everything-ourselves">Do we have to do everything ourselves?</h3>
<p>No. You will definitely be offered lots of help by the community. Typically, conference organizers will divide responsibilities into different teams, making it possible for more volunteers to join. Local organizers are free to choose which areas they want to invite the community to help out with, and a call will go out through a blog post announcement on djangoproject.com and social media.</p>
<h3 id="what-kind-of-support-can-we-expect-from-the-django-software-foundation-">What kind of support can we expect from the Django Software Foundation?</h3>
<p>The DSF regularly provides grant funding to DjangoCon organizers, to the extent of $6,000 in recent editions. We also offer support via specific working groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>The dedicated<a href="https://github.com/django/dsf-working-groups/blob/main/active/dceu.md"> DjangoCon Europe support working group</a>.</li>
<li>The<a href="https://github.com/django/dsf-working-groups/blob/main/active/social-media.md"> social media working group</a> can help you promote the event.</li>
<li>The<a href="https://github.com/django/dsf-working-groups/blob/main/active/code-of-conduct.md"> Code of Conduct working group</a> works with all event organizers.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, a lot of<a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/individual-members/"> Individual Members</a> of the DSF regularly volunteer at community events. If your team aren’t Individual Members, we can reach out to them on your behalf to find volunteers.</p>
<h3 id="what-dates-are-possible-in-2026">What dates are possible in 2026?</h3>
<p>For 2026, DjangoCon Europe should happen between January 5th and April 27th, or June 4th and June 28th. This is to avoid the following community events’ provisional dates:</p>
<ul>
<li>PyCon US 2026: May 2026</li>
<li>EuroPython 2026: July 2026</li>
<li>DjangoCon US 2026: September - October 2026</li>
<li>DjangoCon Africa 2026: August - September 2026</li>
</ul>
<p>We also want to avoid the following holidays:</p>
<ul>
<li>New Year's Day: Wednesday 1st January 2026</li>
<li>Chinese New Year: Tuesday 17th February 2026</li>
<li>Eid Al-Fitr: Friday 20th March 2026</li>
<li>Passover: Wednesday 1st - Thursday 9th April 2026</li>
<li>Easter: Sunday 5th April 2026</li>
<li>Eid Al-Adha: Tuesday 26th - Friday 29th May 2026</li>
<li>Rosh Hashanah: Friday 11th - Sunday 13th September 2026</li>
<li>Yom Kippur: Sunday 20th - Monday 21st September 2026</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-cities-or-countries-are-possible-">What cities or countries are possible?</h3>
<p>Any city in Europe. This can be a city or country where DjangoCon Europe has happened in the past (Vigo, Edinburgh, Porto, Copenhagen, Heidelberg, Florence, Budapest, Cardiff, Toulon, Warsaw, Zurich, Amsterdam, Berlin), or a new locale.</p>

<li><p>PyPy3.10, which is an interpreter supporting the syntax and the features of
Python 3.10, including the stdlib for CPython 3.10.14.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The interpreters are based on much the same codebase, thus the dual
release. This is a micro release, all APIs are compatible with the other 7.3
releases. It follows after 7.3.16 release on April 23, 2024.</p>
<p>We recommend updating. You can find links to download the releases here:</p>

<p>We would like to thank our donors for the continued support of the PyPy
project. If PyPy is not quite good enough for your needs, we are available for
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.pypy.org/pypy-sponsors.html">direct consulting</a> work. If PyPy is helping you out, we would love to hear
about it and encourage submissions to our <a class="reference external" href="https://pypy.org/blog">blog</a> via a pull request
to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pypy/pypy.org">https://github.com/pypy/pypy.org</a></p>
<p>We would also like to thank our contributors and encourage new people to join
the project. PyPy has many layers and we need help with all of them: bug fixes,

<section id="risc-v-backend-for-the-jit">
<span id="risc-v-jit-backend"></span><h3>RISC-V backend for the JIT</h3>
<p>PyPy's JIT has added support for generating 64-bit RISC-V machine code at
runtime (RV64-IMAD, specifically). So far we are not releasing binaries for any
RISC-V platforms, but there are <a class="reference external" href="https://rpython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/riscv.html">instructions</a> on how to cross-compile binaries.</p>
</section>
<section id="repl-improvements">
<span id="improved-repl"></span><h3>REPL Improvements</h3>
<p>The biggest user-visible change of the release is new features in the repl of
PyPy3.10. CPython 3.13 has adopted and extended PyPy's pure-Python repl, adding
a number of features and fixing a number or bugs in the process. We have
backported and added the following features:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Prompts and tracebacks use terminal colors, as well as <a class="reference external" href="https://gist.github.com/egmontkob/eb114294efbcd5adb1944c9f3cb5feda">terminal hyperlinks</a>
for file names.</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bracketed-paste">Bracketed paste</a> enable pasting several lines of input into the terminal
without auto-indentation getting in the way.</p></li>
<li><p>A special interactive help browser (F1), history browser (F2), explicit paste
mode (F3).</p></li>
<li><p>Support for Ctrl-&lt;left/right&gt; to jump over whole words at a time.</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="better-jit-optimizations-of-integer-operations">
<span id="better-jit-optimizations"></span><h3>Better JIT optimizations of integer operations</h3>
<p>The optimizers of PyPy's JIT have become much better at reasoning about and
optimizing integer operations. This is done with a new <a class="reference external" href="https://pypy.org/posts/2024/08/toy-knownbits.html">"knownbits" abstract
domain</a>. In many programs that do bit-manipulation of integers, some of the
bits of the integer variables of the program can be statically known. Here's a
simple example:</p>

<p>With the new abstract domain, the JIT can optimize the <code class="docutils literal">if</code>-condition to
<code class="docutils literal">True</code>, because it already knows that the lowest bit of <code class="docutils literal">x</code> must be set.
This optimization applies to all Python-integers that fit into a machine word
(PyPy optimistically picks between two different representations for <code class="docutils literal">int</code>,
depending on the size of the value). Unfortunately there is very little impact
of this change on almost all Python code, because intensive bit-manipulation is
rare in Python. However, the change leads to significant performance
improvements in <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.pydrofoil.org/en/latest/">Pydrofoil</a> (the RPython-based RISC-V/ARM emulators that are
automatically generated from high-level <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/rems-project/sail/">Sail</a> specifications of the respective
ISAs, and that use the RPython JIT to improve performance).</p>

<section id="pypy-versions-and-speed-pypy-org">
<h3>PyPy versions and speed.pypy.org</h3>
<p>The keen-eyed will have noticed no mention of Python version 3.9 in the
releases above. Typically we will maintain only one version of Python3, but due
to PyPy3.9 support on conda-forge we maintained multiple versions from the
first release of PyPy3.10 in PyPy v7.3.12 (Dec 2022). Conda-forge is
<a class="reference external" href="https://pypy.org/posts/2024/08/conda-forge-proposes-dropping-support-for-pypy.html">sunsetting its PyPy support</a>, which means we can drop PyPy3.9. Since that was
the major driver of benchmarks at <a class="reference external" href="https://speed.pypy.org">https://speed.pypy.org</a>, we revamped the site
to showcase PyPy3.9, PyPy3.10, and various versions of cpython on the home
page. For historical reasons, the "baseline" for comparison is still cpython
3.7.19.</p>
<p>We will keep the buildbots building PyPY3.9 until the end of August, these
builds will still be available on the <a class="reference external" href="https://buildbot.pypy.org/nightly/">nightly builds</a> tab of the buildbot.</p>

<section id="what-is-pypy">
<h3>What is PyPy?</h3>
<p>PyPy is a Python interpreter, a drop-in replacement for CPython
It's fast (<a class="reference external" href="https://speed.pypy.org">PyPy and CPython</a> performance
comparison) due to its integrated tracing JIT compiler.</p>
<p>We also welcome developers of other <a class="reference external" href="https://rpython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html">dynamic languages</a> to see what RPython
can do for them.</p>
<p>We provide binary builds for:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>x86</strong> machines on most common operating systems
(Linux 32/64 bits, Mac OS 64 bits, Windows 64 bits)</p></li>
<li><p>64-bit <strong>ARM</strong> machines running Linux (<code class="docutils literal">aarch64</code>) and macos (<code class="docutils literal">macos_arm64</code>).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>PyPy supports Windows 32-bit, Linux PPC64 big- and little-endian, Linux ARM
32 bit, RISC-V RV64IMAFD Linux, and s390x Linux but does not release binaries.
Please reach out to us if you wish to sponsor binary releases for those
platforms. Downstream packagers provide binary builds for debian, Fedora,
conda, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, Gentoo, and more.</p>

            <p>Greetings, Pythonistas- thank you so much for supporting the work of the Python Software Foundation (PSF) and the Python community! The current PSF Board has decided to invest more in connecting and serving the global Python community by establishing a forum to have regular conversations. The <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/board/" target="_blank">board members of the PSF</a> with the support of <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/records/staff/" target="_blank">PSF staff</a> are excited to introduce monthly PSF Board Office Hours on the <a href="https://discord.gg/4Hm36PPgpG" target="_blank">PSF Discord</a>. The Office Hours will be sessions where you can share with us how we can help your community, express your perspectives, and provide feedback for the PSF.<br /><br /></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">What are the PSF Board Office Hours?</h2><p>Similar to the <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/02/introducing-psf-grants-office-hours.html" target="_blank">PSF Grants Program Office Hours</a> where PSF staff members help to answer questions regarding the <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/grants/" target="_blank">PSF Grants Program</a>, during the PSF Board Office Hours you can participate in a <b>text-based live chat</b> with PSF Board Directors. This is a chance to connect, share, and collaborate with the PSF Board and staff to improve our community together. Occasionally, we will have dedicated topics such as PyCon US and the PSF Board Elections for the office hour sessions. <br /><br />Here is some of the work that we collaborate with staff and volunteers on:<br /></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Promotion and outreach for the Python programming language</li><li>Supporting local Python communities</li><li>Organizing <a href="https://us.pycon.org/" target="_blank">PyCon US</a></li><li>Diversity and Inclusion in our community</li><li>Support handling of Code of Conduct within our communities</li><li>Support regional Python communities via the <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/grants/" target="_blank">PSF Grants Program</a></li><li>Furthering the <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/mission/" target="_blank">mission of the PSF</a></li></ul><p><br />Unless we have a dedicated topic for a session, you are not limited to talking with us about the above topics, although the discussions should be focused on Python, the PSF, and our community. If you think there’s something we can help with or we should know, we welcome you to come and talk to us!<br /><br /></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Joining the office hours</h2><p>The office hour sessions will take place on the PSF Discord server in the #psf-board channel. If you are new to Discord, make sure to check out a <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360033931551-Getting-Started" target="_blank">tutorial on how you can download the Discord app and sign up for free</a>– then join us on the <a href="https://discord.gg/4Hm36PPgpG" target="_blank">PSF Discord</a>! To make the office hours more accessible, the office hours will be scheduled at alternating times so no matter where you are based, you can find a time that is most convenient for you! Here is a list of the dates and times:<br /></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>September 10th, 2024: 1pm UTC </li><li>October 8th, 2024: 9pm UTC</li><li>November 12th, 2024: 2pm UTC</li><li>December 10th, 2024: 9pm UTC</li><li>January 14th, 2025: 2pm UTC</li><li>February 11th, 2025: 9pm UTC</li><li>March 11th, 2025: 1pm UTC</li><li>April 8th, 2025:&nbsp; 9pm UTC</li><li>May 13th, 2025: 1pm UTC (Live from PyCon US!)</li><li>June 10th, 2025: 9pm UTC</li><li>July 9th, 2025:&nbsp; 1pm UTC</li><li>August 12th, 2025: 9pm UTC</li></ul><p>Each session lasts for an hour. Make sure to <a href="https://time.is/" target="_blank">check what time these sessions are for you locally</a> so you don't miss out! Sessions after August 13th, 2025, will be announced in the future.<br />&nbsp;</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Who will be at the office hours?</h2><p>Some of the board members of the PSF will be attending each office hour, as well as members of the PSF Staff. The <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/board/" target="_blank">list of the PSF Board Directors</a> can be found on our website. We are passionate Python community members who are happy to listen, help, and provide support to you. We are happy to follow up with you if there are any issues we cannot address immediately during the office hour sessions. As always, you can email us at psf-board@python.org with inquiries, feedback, or comments at any time.<br /><br /></p>

            <p>Given that I can't stop creating template engines, I figured I might write
a bit about my learnings of creating <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mitsuhiko/minijinja/">MiniJinja</a> which is an implementation of
my Jinja2 template engine for Rust.  Disclaimer: this post might be a bit
more technical.</p>
<p>There is a good chance you have come across Jinja2 templates before as
they became quite common place in various places over the years.  They
look a bit like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="cp">{%</span> <span class="k">extends</span> <span class="s2">&quot;layout.html&quot;</span> <span class="cp">%}</span><span class="x"></span>
<span class="cp">{%</span> <span class="k">block</span> <span class="nv">body</span> <span class="cp">%}</span><span class="x"></span>
<span class="x">  &lt;p&gt;Hello </span><span class="cp">{{</span> <span class="nv">name</span> <span class="cp">}}</span><span class="x">!&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="cp">{%</span> <span class="k">endblock</span> <span class="cp">%}</span><span class="x"></span>

<div class="section" id="why-minijinja">
<h2>Why MiniJinja?</h2>
<p>Maybe we start with the initial question of why I wrote MiniJinja.  It's
the year 2024 and people don't create a ton of HTML with server side
rendered template engines any more.  While there is some resurgence of
that model thanks to HTMX, hotwire and livewire, I personally use <a class="reference external" href="https://www.solidjs.com/">SolidJS</a> for my internal UI needs.  There is however
always a need to generate some form of text and so somehow Jinja2's need
never really went away.  When I originally created it, it was clearly
meant for generating HTML with some JavaScript sprinkled on top, but in
the years since I have encountered Jinja templates in many more places,
primarily for generating YAML and similar formats.  Lately it comes up for
LLM prompt generation.</p>
<p>My personal need for MiniJinja came out of an experiment I built for
infrastructure automation.  Since the templates had to be loaded
dynamically I could not use a system like Askama.  Askama has type-safe
templates that just generate Rust code.  On the other hand most Jinja
inspired template engines that are dynamic in Rust really do not try very
hard to be Jinja compatible.  Because writing template engines is also fun,
I figured I might give it another try.</p>
<p>Over the last two years I kept adding to the engine until it got to the
point where it's at almost feature parity with Jinja2 and quite enjoyable
to use.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="runtime-values">
<h2>Runtime Values</h2>
<p>When building a template engine for Rust you end up building a little
dynamic programming language that is optimized for text generation.
Consequently you pull in most of the challenges of building a dynamic
language.  Particularly when working in Rust the immediate challenge is
memory management and exposing native Rust objects to the embedded
language.  So the interesting bit here is how to create a system that
allows interactions between the template engine and the Rust world around
it.</p>
<p>MiniJinja, unlike Jinja2 does not use code generation but has a basic
stack based VM and a AST based bytecode compiler.  Since MiniJinja follows
Jinja2 it inherits a lot of the realities of the underlying object system
that Jinja2 inherits from Python.  For instance macros (functions) are
first class objects and they can have closures.  This has challenges
because it's easy to create cycles and Rust has no garbage collector that
can help with this problem.</p>
<p>The core object model in MiniJinja is a <cite>Value</cite> type which is represented
by an enum that looks as follows (some less important variants removed):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="cp">#[derive(Clone)]</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="k">pub</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">struct</span> <span class="nc">Value</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">ValueRepr</span><span class="p">);</span><span class="w"></span>

<p>Externaly everything is a <cite>Value</cite>.  If you <cite>Clone</cite> it, you usually bump a
reference count or you make a cheap memcopy.  Values are either primitives
such as strings, numbers etc. or objects.</p>
<p>For objects MiniJinja provides a tait called <cite>Object</cite> which can be
implemented by most Rust types.  The engine provides a <cite>DynObject</cite> wrapper
is a fancy <cite>Arc&lt;dyn Object&gt;</cite> which supports borrowing and object safety.
<a class="reference external" href="http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2024/5/16/macro-vtable-magic/">I wrote about this before</a>.  What you
will notice is that quite a few of the types involved have an <cite>Arc</cite>.
That's because these values are for the most part reference counted.
Since values here are really fat (they are 24 bytes in memory) a
<cite>SmallStr</cite> type is used to hold up to 22 bytes of string data inline.  One
byte is used to encode the length of the string, and another byte is then
used by the <cite>ValueRepr</cite> to mark which enum variant is in use.  In pure
theory this is all wrong.  We never use weak references, so the weak count
in the <cite>Arc</cite> is not used and clever bit hackery could be used to greatly
reduce the size of the value type.  I think one could get the whole thing
down to 16 bytes trivially or even 8 bytes with NaN tagging.  However I
did not want to walk into the world of unsafe code more than feels
appropriate.</p>
<p>MiniJinjia is also <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mitsuhiko/minijinja/tree/main/benchmarks">plenty fast</a>.</p>
<p>One variant that is worth calling out is <cite>Invalid</cite>.  That's a value that
can exist in the system but it carries an error.  When you're trying to
interact with it in most cases it will propagate this error.  That's used
in the engine in places where the API assumes infallability (particularly
during iteration) but it needs a way to emit an error.  This concept is
quite common when writing an engine in C though typically the actual error
is carried out of bounds.  For instance in QuickJS there is a marker value
that indicates a failure, but the actual error is held on the interpreter
runtime.</p>

<p>Some of these methods are implemented automatically.  For instance many of
the methods such as <cite>is_true</cite> or <cite>enumerator_len</cite> have a default
implementation that is based on object <cite>repr</cite> and the return value from
<cite>enumerate</cite>.  But they can be overridden to change the default behavior or
to add some potential optimizations.</p>
<p>One of the most important types in Jinja is a map as it holds the template
context.  They are implemented as you can imagine as <cite>Object</cite>.  The
implementation is in fact pretty trivial:</p>

<p>This reveals two interesting aspects of the object model: First that
<cite>Value</cite> implements <cite>Hash</cite>.  That means any value can be used as the key in
a value.  While this is untypical for Rust and even not what happens in
Python, it simplifies the system greatly.  When in the template engine you
write <cite>{{ object.key }}</cite>, behind the scenes
<cite>object.get_value(Value::from(&quot;key&quot;))</cite> is called.  Since most keys are
typically less than 22 characters, creating a dummy <cite>Value</cite> wrapper around
is not too problematic.</p>
<p>The second and probably more interesting part here is that you can sort of
borrow out of an object for the enumerator.  The <cite>mapped_enumerator</cite>
helper takes a reference to self and invokes a closure which itself can
borrow from self.  This adjacent borrowing is implemented with unsafe code
as there is no other way to make it work.  The combination of <cite>repr</cite>
(defaults to <cite>Map</cite>), <cite>get_value</cite> and <cite>enumerate</cite> gives the object the
behavior, shape and contents.</p>
<p>Vectors look quite similar:</p>

<p>Some of the trivial enumerators are quick to explain:
<cite>Enumerator::NonEnumerable</cite> just does not support iteration and
<cite>Enumerator::Empty</cite> does but won't yield any values.  The more interesting
one is <cite>Enumerator::Seq(n)</cite> which basically tells the engine to call
<cite>get_value</cite> from 0 to <cite>n</cite> to yield items from the object.  This is how
sequences are implemented.  The rest are enumerators that just directly
yield values.</p>
<p>So when you want to iterate over a map, you will usually use something
like <cite>Enumerator::Iter</cite> and iterate over all the keys in the map.</p>
<p>The engine then uses <cite>ObjectRepr</cite> to figure out what to do with it.  For
a value marked as <cite>ObjectRepr::Seq</cite> it will display like a sequence, you
can index it with integers, and that it iterates over the values in the
sequence.  If the repr is <cite>ObejctRepr::Map</cite> then the expectation is that
it will be indexable by key and it will iterate over the keys when used in
a loop.  Its default rendering also is a key-value pair list wrapped in
curly braces.</p>
<p>Now quite frankly I don't like that iteration protocol.  I think it's more
sensible for maps to naturally iterate over the key-value pairs, but since
MiniJinja follows Jinja2 and Jinja2 follows Python emulating was
important.</p>
<p>Enumerators are a bit different than iterators because they might only
define how iteration is performed (see: <cite>Enumerator::Seq</cite>).  To actually
create an iterator, the object is then passed to it.  They are also asked
to provide a length.  When an enumerator provides a length it's an
indication to the engine that the object can be iterated over more than
once (you can re-create the enumerator).  This is why objects land in a
MiniJinja template that looks like a list, but is actually just an
iterable object with a known length.  For this MiniJinja uses a trick
where it will inspect the size hint of the iterator to make assumptions
about it.  Internally every enumerator allows the engine to query the
length of it:</p>

<p>The important part here is the call to <cite>size_hint</cite>.  If the upper bound is
known, and the lower bound matches the upper bound then MiniJinja will
assume the iterator will always have that length (for as long as not
iterated).  As a result it will change the way the object is interacted
with.  This for instance means that if you run <cite>range(10)</cite> in a template
it looks like a list when printed even though iteration and number
creation is lazy.  On the other hand if you use the
<cite>Value::make_one_shot_iterator</cite> API the length hint will always be
disabled and MiniJinja will not attempt to interact with the iterator when
printing it:</p>

<h2>Building a VM</h2>
<p>Lexing and parsing I think is not too puzzling in Rust, but making an AST
and making a VM is kinda unusual.  The first thing is that Rust is just
not particularly amazing at tree structures.  In MiniJinja I really wanted
to avoid having the AST at all, but it does come in in handy to implement
some of the functionality that Jinja2 requires.  For instance to establish
closures it will just walk the AST to figure out which names are looked up
within a function.  I tried a few things to improve how memory allocations
work with the AST.  There are great crates out there for doing this, but
I really wanted MiniJinja to be light on dependencies so I ended up opting
against all of them.</p>
<p>For the AST design I went with large enums that hold <cite>Spanned&lt;T&gt;</cite> values:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">pub</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">enum</span> <span class="nc">Expr</span><span class="o">&lt;'</span><span class="na">a</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>

<span class="w">    </span><span class="n">Const</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Spanned</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Const</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">),</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="o">..</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="w"></span>

<span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>
<p>You might now be curious what <cite>Spanned&lt;T&gt;</cite> is.  It's a wrapper type that
does two things: it boxes the inner node and it stores and adjacent <cite>Span</cite>
which is basically the code location in the original input template for
debugging:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">pub</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">struct</span> <span class="nc">Spanned</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">T</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="n">node</span>: <span class="nb">Box</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">T</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="n">span</span>: <span class="nc">Span</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>
<p>It implements <cite>Deref</cite> like a smart pointer so you can poke right through
it to interact with the node.  The code generator just walks the AST and
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mitsuhiko/minijinja/blob/main/minijinja/src/compiler/codegen.rs">emits instructions</a>
for it.</p>
<p>The instructions themselves are a large enum but the number of arguments
to the variants is kept rather low to not waste too much memory.  The base
size of the instruction is dominated by it being able to hold a <cite>Value</cite>
which as we have established is a pretty hefty thing:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">pub</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">enum</span> <span class="nc">Instruction</span><span class="o">&lt;'</span><span class="na">source</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>

<p>The VM keeps most of the runtime state on a <cite>State</cite> object that is passed
to a few places.  For instance you have already seen this in the <cite>call</cite>
signature further up.  The state for instance holds the loaded
instructions or the template context.  The VM itself maintains a stack of
values and then just steps through a list of instructions on the state in
a loop.  Since there are a lot of instructions you can <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mitsuhiko/minijinja/blob/b327a8c41ae869bb71452e7b645126ff6966e2ef/minijinja/src/vm/mod.rs#L216">have a look on

<p>Basically the current instruction is held in <cite>pc</cite> (short for program
counter), normally it's advanced by one but jump instructions can change
the <cite>pc</cite> to any other location.  If you run out of instructions the
evaluation ends.</p>
<p>One piece of complexity in the VM comes down to macros.  That's because
lifetimes make that really tricky.  A macro is just a <cite>Value</cite> that holds a
<cite>Macro</cite> <cite>Object</cite> internally.  So how can that macro reference the
instructions, if the instructions themselves have a lifetime to the
template <cite>'source</cite>?  The answer is that they can't (at least I have not
found a reasonable way).  So instead a macro has an ID which acts as a
handle to look up the instructions dynamically from the execution state.
Additionally each state has a unique ID so the engine can assert that
nothing funny was happening.  The downside of this is that a macro cannot
be &quot;returned&quot; from a template.  They can however be imported from one
template into another.</p>
<p>Here is what a macro object looks like in code (abbreviated):</p>

<p>Additionally the closure is a good source of cycles.  For that reason the
engine keeps track of all closures during the execution and breaks cycles
caused by closures manually by clearning them out.</p>

<p>You might have seem something like this in Rust before, but it's still a
bit magical.  How can you make functions with seemingly different
signatures register with the <cite>add_filter</cite> function?  How does the engine
perform the type conversions (as we know the engine has <cite>Value</cite> types, so
where does the <cite>String</cite> conversion take place?).  This is a topic for a
blog post on its own but the answer behind this lies in a a lot of clever
trait hackery.  The <cite>add_filter</cite> function reveals a bit of that hackery:</p>

<p>Hidden behind this rather complex set of traits are some basic ideas:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><cite>FunctionArgs</cite> is a helper trait for type conversions.  It's
implemented for tuples of different sizes made of <cite>ArgType</cite> values.
These tuples represent the signature of the function.  It has a method
called <cite>from_values</cite> which performs that conversion via <cite>ArgType</cite>.</li>
<li><cite>ArgType</cite> which you can't really see in the code above, is a trait that
knows how to convert a <cite>Value</cite> into whatever the function desires as
argument.</li>
<li><cite>Filter</cite> is a trait implemented for function with qualifying
<cite>FunctionArgs</cite> signatures returning a <cite>FunctionResult</cite>.</li>
<li>A <cite>FunctionResult</cite> is a trait that represents potential return values
from the function such as a <cite>Value</cite>, something that can be converted into
a <cite>Value</cite> or a <cite>Result</cite>.</li>
<li>The <cite>BoxedFilter</cite> type is what converts the passed closure into a
reference counted object that is held in the environment.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I think a lot of the patterns in MiniJinja are useful for projects
outside of MiniJinja.  Quite is quite a bit more hidden in it that I have
talked about before such as how <a class="reference external" href="http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2021/11/14/abusing-serde/">MiniJinja is abusing serde</a>.  If you have a need for a Jinja2
compatible template engine I would love if you get some use out of it.  If
you're curious about how to build a runtime and object system in Rust, you
might also find some utility in the codebase.</p>
<p>I myself learned quite a bit about what creative API design can look like
in Rust by building it.  At this point I am incredibly happy with how the
public API of the engine shaped out to be.  The engine is extensively
documented both internally and publicly and you can <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.rs/minijinja/latest/minijinja/">read all about it in
the API docs</a>.</p>

            <p>As I mentioned in a few <a href="https://nedbatchelder.com/blog/archive/year2024.html#month202407" rel="external noopener">recent posts</a>, I&#8217;ve been working
on some significant work in coverage.py to take advantage of new capabilities in
Python.</p><p>Mark Shannon has been <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/122564" rel="external noopener">improving the sys.monitoring
API</a> so that branch coverage can be done with low overhead.  I want to take
advantage of that in coverage.py, but I needed to do some refactoring work
first.  The tests were focused on mapping the complete set of code pathways
(which I called arcs), but using low-overhead branch monitoring won&#8217;t provide
those complete pathways.  If the tests continued to focus on them, they would
fail with sys.monitoring.</p><p>But the complete pathways aren&#8217;t actually needed.  The useful information is
where the branches are, and which branches were taken.  That can be measured
with sys.monitoring.  So a first step was to refactor the tests to focus on
branches instead of arcs.  That took a while, but is now done.</p><p>Not needing all those arcs also meant I could simplify the AST-based parser
that found the arcs, removing about 150 lines.  I suspect there&#8217;s more that
could be removed. Maybe it will happen over time. Also, the new
code.co_branches() method might make it all obsolete over time.</p><p>If you read <a href="https://nedbatchelder.com/blog/202406/coverage_at_a_crossroads.html">Coverage at a crossroads</a> on this blog, I
talked about using ideas from SlipCover like inserting fake lines with an import
hook.  Those exotic ideas were appealing in their way, but are no longer needed,
and they would have brought a bunch of complexity.  With the two new
sys.monitoring events, we can get the branch information directly without
advanced shenanigans.</p><p>There&#8217;s more work to do, including attending to incoming bug reports.  If
you&#8217;d like to help, or learn more about any of this, we have a

<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>Continuing in the series of articles about newest cloud connections in Zato 3.2, this episode covers Atlassian Jira
from the perspective of invoking its APIs to build integrations between Jira and other systems.</p>
<p>There are essentially two use modes of integrations with Jira:</p>
<ol>
<li>Jira reacts to events taking place in your projects and invokes your endpoints accordingly via WebHooks.
   In this case, it is Jira that explicitly establishes connections with and sends requests to your APIs.</li>
<li>Jira projects are queried periodically or as a consequence of events triggered by Jira using means other than WebHooks.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://upcdn.io/kW15bqq/raw/root/static/blog/images/3.2-atlassian/jira-integrations.png" /></p>
<p>The first case is usually more straightforward to conceptualize - you create a WebHook in Jira, point it to your endpoint
and Jira invokes it when a situation of interest arises, e.g. a new ticket is opened or updated. I will talk about this variant
of integrations with Jira in a future instalment as the current one is about the other situation, when it is your systems
that establish connections with Jira.</p>
<p>The reason why it is more practical to first speak about the second form is that, even if WebHooks are somewhat easier
to reason about, they do come with their own ramifications.</p>
<p>To start off, assuming that you use the cloud-based version of
Jira (e.g. https://example.atlassian.net), you need to have a publicly available endpoint for Jira to invoke through WebHooks.
Very often, this is undesirable because the systems that you need to integrate with may be internal ones, never meant
to be exposed to public networks.</p>
<p>Secondly, your endpoints need to have a TLS certificate signed by a public Certificate Authority and they need to be accessible
on port 443. Again, both of these are something that most enterprise systems will not allow at all or it may take months
or years to process such a change internally across the various corporate departments involved.</p>
<p>Lastly, even if a WebHook can be used, it is not always a given that the initial information that you receive in the request
from a WebHook will already contain everything that you need in your particular integration service. Thus, you will still
need a way to issue requests to Jira to look up details of a particular object, such as tickets, in this way reducing
WebHooks to the role of initial triggers of an interaction with Jira, e.g. a WebHook invokes your endpoint,
you have a ticket ID on input and then you invoke Jira back anyway to obtain all the details that you
actually need in your business integration.</p>
<p>The end situation is that, although WebHooks are a useful concept that I will write about in a future article,
they may very well not be sufficient for many integration use cases. That is why I start with integration
methods that are alternative to WebHooks.</p>
<h2 id="alternatives-to-webhooks">Alternatives to WebHooks</h2>
<p>If, in our case, we cannot use WebHooks then what next? Two good approaches are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Scheduled jobs</li>
<li>Reacting to emails (via IMAP)</li>
</ol>
<p>Scheduled jobs will let you periodically inquire with Jira about the changes that you have not processed yet. For instance,
with a job definition as below:</p>
<p><img src="https://upcdn.io/kW15bqq/raw/root/static/blog/images/3.2-atlassian/jira-scheduler-menu.png" /></p>
<p><img src="https://upcdn.io/kW15bqq/raw/root/static/blog/images/3.2-atlassian/jira-scheduler-sample.png" /></p>
<p>Now, the service configured for this job will be invoked once per minute to carry out any integration works required.
For instance, it can get a list of tickets since the last time it ran, process each of them as required in your business context
and update a database with information about what has been just done - the database can be based on Redis, MongoDB, SQL or anything
else.</p>
<p>Integrations built around scheduled jobs make most sense when you need to make periodic sweeps across a large swaths of business
data, these are the "Give me everything that changed in the last period" kind of interactions when you do not know precisely
how much data you are going to receive.</p>
<p>In the specific case of Jira tickets, though, an interesting alternative may be to combine scheduled jobs with IMAP connections:</p>
<p><img src="https://upcdn.io/kW15bqq/raw/root/static/blog/images/3.2-atlassian/jira-imap-menu.png" /></p>
<p><img src="https://upcdn.io/kW15bqq/raw/root/static/blog/images/3.2-atlassian/jira-imap-form.png" /></p>
<p>The idea here is that when new tickets are opened, or when updates are made to existing ones, Jira will send out notifications
to specific email addresses and we can take advantage of it.</p>
<p>For instance, you can tell Jira to CC or BCC an address such as zato@example.com. Now, Zato will still run a scheduled job
but instead of connecting with Jira directly, that job will look up unread emails for it inbox
("UNSEEN" per the relevant
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Message_Access_Protocol">RFC</a>).</p>
<p>Anything that is unread must be new since the last iteration which means that we can process each such email from the inbox, in this way
guaranteeing that we process only the latest updates, dispensing with the need for our own database of tickets already processed.
We can extract the ticket ID or other details from the email, look up its details in Jira and the continue as needed.</p>
<p>All the details of how to work with IMAP emails are provided in the documentation but it would boil down to this:</p>

<p>The natural question is - how would the "process_message" function extract details of a ticket from an email?</p>
<p>There are several ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Each email has a subject of a fixed form - "[JIRA] (ABC-123) Here goes description". In this case, ABC-123 is the ticket ID.</li>
<li>Each email will contain a summary, such as the one below, which can also be parsed:</li>
</ol>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="line-1-1" name="line-1-1"></a><a href="#line-1-1"><span class="linenos"></span></a><span class="w">         </span>Summary:<span class="w"> </span>Here<span class="w"> </span>goes<span class="w"> </span>description

</code></pre></div>
<ol>
<li>Finally, each email will have an "X-Atl-Mail-Meta" header with interesting metadata that can also be parsed and extracted:</li>
</ol>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="line-2-1" name="line-2-1"></a><a href="#line-2-1"><span class="linenos"></span></a>X-Atl-Mail-Meta:<span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">user_id</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;123456:12d80508-dcd0-42a2-a2cd-c07f230030e5&quot;</span>,
<a id="line-2-2" name="line-2-2"></a><a href="#line-2-2"><span class="linenos"></span></a><span class="w">                 </span><span class="nv">event_type</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;Issue Created&quot;</span>,

</code></pre></div>
<p>The first option is the most straightforward and likely the most convenient one - simply parse out the ticket ID and
call Jira with that ID on input for all the other information about the ticket. How to do it exactly is presented in the
next chapter.</p>
<p>Regardless of how we parse the emails, the important part is that we know that we invoke Jira only when there are new or updated
tickets - otherwise there would not have been any new emails to process. Moreover, because it is our side that invokes Jira,
we do not expose our internal system to the public network directly.</p>
<p>However, from the perspective of the overall security architecture, email is still part of the attack surface so we need to make
sure that we read and parse emails with that in view. In other words, regardless of whether it is Jira invoking us
or our reading emails from Jira, all the usual security precautions regarding API integrations and accepting input from external
resources, all that still holds and needs to be part of the design of the integration workflow.</p>
<h2 id="creating-jira-connections">Creating Jira connections</h2>
<p>The above presented the ways in which we can arrive at the step of when we invoke Jira and now we are ready to actually do it.</p>
<p>As with other types of connections, Jira connections are created in Zato Dashboard, as below. Note that you use the email
address of a user on whose behalf you connect to Jira but the only other credential is that user's API token previously
generated in Jira, not the user's password.</p>

<p><img src="https://upcdn.io/kW15bqq/raw/root/static/blog/images/3.2-atlassian/jira-form.png" /></p>
<p><img src="https://upcdn.io/kW15bqq/raw/root/static/blog/images/3.2-atlassian/jira-change-api-token.png" /></p>
<h2 id="invoking-jira">Invoking Jira</h2>
<p>With a Jira connection in place, we can now create a Python API service. In this case, we accept a ticket ID on input
(called "a key" in Jira) and we return a few details about the ticket to our caller.</p>
<p>This is the kind of a service that could be invoked from a service that is triggered by a scheduled job. That is,
we would separate the tasks, one service would be responsible for opening IMAP inboxes and parsing emails
and the one below would be responsible for communication with Jira.</p>
<p>Thanks to this loose coupling, we make everything much more reusable - that the services can be changed independently is but one part
and the more important side is that, with such separation, both of them can be reused by future services as well,
without tying them rigidly to this one integration alone.</p>

<h2 id="creating-a-rest-channel-and-testing-it">Creating a REST channel and testing it</h2>
<p>The last remaining part is a REST channel to invoke our service through. We will provide the ticket ID (key) on input
and the service will reply with what was found in Jira for that ticket.</p>

<p>We are now ready for the final step - we invoke the channel, which invokes the service which communicates with Jira,
transforming the response from Jira to the output that we need:</p>

<p>If you didn't know, I'm from Minnesota. Minnesotans love their State Fair,
and I'm not an exception! My wife and I were lucky enough to go to a State Fair
preview for LuLu's Public House for <a href="https://www.mnstatefair.org/new-this-year/food/deep-fried-ranch-dressing/">fried ranch dressing</a> among a handful of new
drinks. I <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@sethmlarson/113000751781981825">shared my thoughts on Mastodon</a> and a few folks seemed interested in hearing more: so here's more!</p>

<h2>Cajun fried pickles from <a href="https://www.mnstatefair.org/vendor/3089.1/">The Perfect Pickle</a></h2>

<p>These are hands-down the best food at the Minnesota State Fair. You eat an order,
ponder getting more (some years we do!) and then wonder to yourself why they put
the <strong>best of the best</strong> right next to the shuttle entrance. Don't go out looking for
answers lest they move these further away, sometimes it's best to
leave sleeping “<a href="https://www.mnstatefair.org/vendor/3060.1/">pickle dogs</a>” lie.</p>

<p>Seriously, if you like pickles even a little bit, get these pickles.
You can get them quick if you're lucky and other folks don't realize there are
supposed to be six lines of people taking orders.</p>

<p>They're ripping hot right when they hand them to you, so if you're like me
and enjoy food “biting back” then don't delay! 🔥 </p>

<p>This year included a noticeable increase in the amount of Cajun seasoning,
or we got lucky and someone behind the scenes gave us an extra
coating (either way we're not complaining!)</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.mnstatefair.org/new-this-year/food/pb-bacon-cakes/">Peanut Butter Bacon Cakes</a> and Blue Cheese &amp; Corn Fritz from <a href="https://www.mnstatefair.org/vendor/1968.1/">The Blue Barn</a></h2>

<p>Celebrating their 10th consecutive year at the Minnesota State Fair, The Blue Barn
is always a fan favorite. Seriously, run over there if you get to the fair early to
beat the massive lines for food and drinks.</p>

<p>We grabbed the new Peanut Butter Bacon Cakes along with the returning classic
Blue Cheese &amp; Corn Fritz which I had never tried before.</p>

<p>The Peanut Butter Bacon Cakes were really great, there was thick-cut bacon
griddled inside of pancake batter strips along with jelly and a peanut butter
whipped cream. Perfect combo of savory and sweet, and you're in complete control of the ratios.
The bacon and pancake flavors reminded me of learning to make pancakes with my late grandfather.
Although <em>that</em> bacon was microwave-ready Hormel bacon... I promise this one's delish!</p>

<p>The Blue Cheese &amp; Corn Fritz was really great, I missed out on this
one last year. Perfect amount of sweetness from the corn, really well-balanced cheesy little bite!
Wish I could have had more than one of these, we were sharing amongst a big group!</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.mnstatefair.org/new-this-year/food/wrangler-waffle-burger/">Wrangler Waffle Burger</a>, Bacon-Wrapped Pickle Dog, and “Kind of a Big Dill” Lemonade from <a href="https://www.mnstatefair.org/vendor/1476.1/">Nordic Waffles</a></h2>

<p>Another vendor that fills up immediately after opening, Nordic Waffle should be top of your list because
of two returning new foods from 2023: the Bacon-Wrapped Pickle Dog and the Pickle Lemonade. Both of these are
really great, the lemonade sounds strange but works really well (even if you don't love pickles). The subtle saltiness
balances out the sweet and tartness which makes for a dangerously drinkable item.</p>

<p>The Wrangler was good, it's one of those winning combinations of flavors that is really hard to mess up:
beef, cheese, caramelized onions, and a mayo-based sauce. The onions being grilled into the waffle was
fun but didn't do much flavor-wise (they might as well have been a topping), honestly wish they went all-out on the onions to the point of being
noticeable texture-wise in the waffle. The bacon-wrapped pickle dog is as awesome as it sounds, so much more interesting flavor-wise!</p>

<p>I'm also not a fan of their choice of sauce, they went with Whataburger, a <a href="https://youtu.be/c5HHnCmxBRE?feature=shared&amp;t=36">famously mid-tier</a> burger joint in <strong>Texas</strong>, of all places?
This is a grave error by Nordic Waffles because Minnesota and Texas have serious State Fair beef.
Minnesota seeing the highest single-day attendance over 12 days, where the Texas State Fair sees the highest total attendance over <strong>24 days</strong> (it might be obvious which State Fair I think is the true champion).</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.mnstatefair.org/new-this-year/food/sweet-corn-cola-float/">Sweet Corn Cola Float</a> from <a href="https://www.mnstatefair.org/vendor/212.1">Blue Moon Dine-in Theater</a></h2>

<p>This one was interesting! Sweet Corn icecream <em>and</em> house-made “corn Cola”, so I take that to mean
corn syrup Cola? Not sure. The flavor definitely gave a “not-too-sweet” vibe which was nice, there was a good amount of a corny
and almost “earthy” flavor in the float.</p>

<p>The texture of the corn icecream was a little less smooth
than a normal icecream, which landed somewhere between novel and “interesting”.
I actually recommend giving this one a good mix before you drink it to blend the
flavors together better, you're only given a boba straw to drink it.</p>

<p>Overall, would I get it again? Probably not, because Lift Bridge root beer floats exist and are much better. But worth a try!</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.mnstatefair.org/new-this-year/food/sweet-heat-bacon-crunch/">Sweet Heat Bacon Crunch</a> from <a href="https://www.mnstatefair.org/vendor/3217.1">RC's BBQ</a></h2>

<p>Had this one side-by-side with my typical order from RC's which is a bunch of ribs and
yeah, it was fine, but if I'm buying barbecue I want ribs or brisket. There was some chili crisp
(but not much, maybe because it's Minnesota) and hot honey that got a bit lost in the dish.
Can't recommend this one, RC's usual items are much better.</p>

<h2>Spam breakfast sandwich from <a href="https://www.mnstatefair.org/vendor/8073.1/">SPAM</a></h2>

<p>Attention all SPAM-lovers at the fair! The SPAM booth has moved from under the Grandstand bridge
to the southern edge of the DNR building. I nearly had a heart-attack when I saw the SPAM booth
wasn't in its usual spot, I had to sneak away with a fellow SPAM-lover from our group to snag
this item.</p>

<p>We got ours with pickles (surprise!) and jalapeños, a little bit of kick and acid to cut through the lovely fatty grilled SPAM.
Pretty sure this little sandwich was gone in 4 bites, highly recommend finding this stand if you're
a long-time-enjoyer or first-timer of SPAM!</p>

<p>That's all for this year. At this point we kept trying new items, but I suspect not being hungry
started to impact my opinions of the foods, so you'll have to try them yourself! :)</p>

            What are the top downloaded pytest plugins?
I want to know this. And I&rsquo;d like the answer updated regularly.
So today I decided to write a script to do that for me.
Grab data Let&rsquo;s start with Top PyPI Packages from Hugo van Kemenade. This list is &ldquo;A monthly dump of the 8,000 most-downloaded packages from PyPI.&rdquo;
Perfect.
Parse Now:
 Filter for &ldquo;pytest&rdquo; in the package name Remove &ldquo;pytest&rdquo; itself.

            Every year the core developers meet to discuss and propose the major changes and trends in Python itself. This invite-only conference of about 50 people happens inside PyCon in the US. Because it's private, we rarely get detailed looks inside this event. On this episode, we have Seth Michael Larson here to give us his account of the sessions and proposals. It's a unique look into the zeitgeist of CPython.

            <p>Here is a slightly delayed (and short) run-down of the new stuff that we
deployed recently.</p>
<p>The main change for this update is that we have updated the underlying OS
running PythonAnywhere to Ubuntu 22.04. This is an LTS release so it will be
supported for some time to come. This will not affect user environments, but it
is setting us up for a new user environment that should be coming soon.</p>
<p>We have also:</p>
<ul>
<li>Started the process of updating our file servers to be more robust</li>
<li>Improved our alerting so that we are alerted to many new forms of failure on PythonAnywhere</li>
<li>Made some improvements to the ASGI beta systems and their documentation</li>
<li>Fixed a number of security issues</li>
<li>Fixed various bugs</li>
