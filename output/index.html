            <p>A few years ago at work, I had a project which offered an opportunity to look at the new generation of async-first, type-hint-driven Python web frameworks. For reasons which aren’t particularly relevant today, on that project I ended up choosing <a href="https://litestar.dev">Litestar</a>, which is the one that <em>doesn’t</em> have a ravenous all-consuming hype machine surrounding it. And I’m very glad I did, because today I’m more convinced than ever it was the right choice, and for the last 18 months or so every new project I’ve started at my day job has been built with&nbsp;Litestar.</p>
<p>But even if you’re someone who does Python web apps for a living, and even if you’re someone who builds asynchronous type-hint-driven web apps, you might not be familiar with this absolute gem of the Python web ecosystem, and today I want to remedy&nbsp;that.</p>
<h2>A&nbsp;taste</h2>
<p>Here’s the traditional single-file-app&nbsp;demo:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kn">from</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nn">litestar</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">Litestar</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">get</span>


<span class="nd">@get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;/greet&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">async</span> <span class="k">def</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nf">greet</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="sa">f</span><span class="s2">&quot;Hi, </span><span class="si">{</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">!&quot;</span>


<span class="n">app</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Litestar</span><span class="p">([</span><span class="n">greet</span><span class="p">])</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>You save this&nbsp;as <code>app.py</code>, run&nbsp;with <code>litestar run</code> or hand it directly to the <abbr title="Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface"><span class="caps">ASGI</span></abbr> server of your choice, and it launches a web application. You go&nbsp;to <code>/greet?name=Bob</code> and it replies “Hi, Bob!”. Leave out&nbsp;the <code>name</code> parameter and it responds with an <span class="caps">HTTP</span> 400 telling you&nbsp;the <code>name</code> parameter is&nbsp;required.</p>
<p>So what. Big deal. The FastAPI Evangelism Strike Force will be along soon to bury you under rocket-ship emoji while explaining that FastAPI does the same thing but a million times better. And if you’re a Java person used to Spring, or a .<span class="caps">NET</span>  person used to <span class="caps">ASP</span>.<span class="caps">NET</span> <span class="caps">MVC</span>, well, there’s nothing here that’s new to you; you’ve had this style of annotation/signature-driven framework for years (and in fact one thing I like about Litestar is how often it reminds me of the good parts of those frameworks). And did anyone tell you FastAPI does this, too!&nbsp;🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀</p>
<p>But there are a lot of things that make Litestar stand out to me in the Python world. I’m going to pick out three to talk about today, and one of them is hiding in plain sight in that simple example&nbsp;application.</p>
<div class="alert alert-warning">
<p><strong>What’s in a&nbsp;name?</strong></p>
<p>You might see older material referring to Litestar as “Starlite”, which was its original&nbsp;name.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.starlette.io">Starlette</a> is a toolkit for doing async Python web development, which can be used standalone or as a component in a more complex library or framework. FastAPI still uses Starlette under the hood, for example. And Litestar originally was built on Starlette too, and was named “Starlite”, presumably in recognition of that. Over time, though, it dropped the Starlette dependency in favor of its own implementations for that functionality, and people on social media complained that the “Starlite” name was confusing, especially since Star<em>lette</em> was no longer being used. So the project which had been “Starlite” was renamed to Litestar for version 2.0, released in 2023, and has had that name ever&nbsp;since.</p>
</div>
<h3>Scaling (the other&nbsp;kind)</h3>
<p>It’s a bit unfortunate that the term “scaling” is almost always assumed to mean handling larger and larger quantities of traffic, because that’s only one axis on which any given piece of of technology can “scale” (and, I’d argue, possibly the least important one). The type of scaling I want to talk about here is scaling of a codebase: how does something (in this case, a web framework) help or hinder you as you deal with different amounts of&nbsp;code?</p>
<p>Django, for example, has a reputation for not scaling “down” all that well. You <em>can</em> do it if you really want to, and every so often someone will come up with a new demo of doing a Django project in a single Python file, but it’s just not something that comes naturally to Django. Quite the opposite: if you work through the official beginner Django tutorial and do things the &#8220;Django way&#8221;, you’ll have around a dozen files laid out in a specific structure of directories and subdirectories before you’ve written a single meaningful line of your own&nbsp;code. </p>
<p>But “micro” frameworks have often had the opposite problem: they’re great at starting out with a tiny single-file application, and then get painful as your codebase grows and needs to spread out (single-file Django approaches have the same problem: you have to do a lot of work to get a “micro-Django” working, and then you have to <em>undo</em> all that work as soon as the code grows large enough to be worth splitting across multiple&nbsp;files).</p>
<p>Let’s look at an example. Here’s a FastAPI equivalent of the basic Litestar application I showed&nbsp;above:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kn">from</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nn">fastapi</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">FastAPI</span>


<span class="n">app</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">FastAPI</span><span class="p">()</span>

<span class="nd">@app</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;/greet&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">async</span> <span class="k">def</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nf">greet</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="sa">f</span><span class="s2">&quot;Hello, </span><span class="si">{</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">!&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Notice that&nbsp;the <code>get()</code> decorator here is attached to the application object. This is a common pattern (Flask/Quart do the same thing, for example, and Starlette used to but has deprecated its entire decorator-based routing system), but it creates a problem once you have multiple files. You need to import the main application object into the other files in order to decorate the routes, but you need to import the other files into your “main” application file to make sure the route registrations are visible from there, and now you have a circular import, and that doesn’t&nbsp;work.</p>
<p>The general solution these frameworks offer is some sort of alternative sub-application object which can act as a per-file route registry that’s safe to import into the file where your application object is defined. FastAPI calls this object an “<span class="caps">API</span> router”; Flask/Quart call it a “blueprint”. Either way, it’s a necessary construct for those frameworks because their route decorators are always bound to some parent object, either the application object in a single-file app or an “<span class="caps">API</span> router”/“blueprint”/etc. object in a multi-file&nbsp;app.</p>
<p>That solves the circular-import problem, but creates a new issue: the whiz-bang quickstart demos of “micro” frameworks generally register all the example routes on the application object in a single file in order to keep everything as simple and flashy as possible, but now in order to build a real application (which will almost never stay in a single file) you’ll need to use a different mechanism, or start out following the demo and then switch later on. You also have to <em>know</em> about that different mechanism; in one framework’s documentation that I looked at, you can (at the time I&#8217;m writing this post) apparently get 40 pages into the user guide before encountering the section on how to register routes in a multi-file app&nbsp;😖😖😖.</p>
<p>Litestar avoids this entire mess by having the route decorators be standalone functions, not bound to a parent application or application-like object. This may seem like a small thing to focus on, but if you’ve spent time with popular Python microframeworks you’ve probably had to deal with the transition from single- to multi-file&nbsp;applications.</p>
<p>More importantly, this small change in approach frees up Litestar’s documentation to introduce route-grouping constructs early on and to present them as part of <a href="https://docs.litestar.dev/latest/usage/applications.html#layered-architecture">a coherent layered architecture/configuration concept</a> rather than as an escape hatch for avoiding circular imports. Which is great, because Litestar’s layered architecture is one of its best features: its grouping constructs, and their ability to share configuration, offer an elegant way to compose functionality. For example, a common pattern I use when writing a set of <abbr title="Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete"><span class="caps">CRUD</span></abbr> endpoints looks like&nbsp;this:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kn">from</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nn">litestar</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">Router</span>
<span class="kn">from</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nn">litestar.di</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">Provide</span>

<span class="c1"># Imagine some CRUD routes for widgets defined here...</span>

<span class="n">_write_widget_router</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Router</span><span class="p">(</span>
    <span class="n">guards</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">some_auth_function</span><span class="p">],</span>
    <span class="n">route_handlers</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">[</span>
        <span class="n">create_widget</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="n">delete_widget</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="n">update_widget</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="p">]</span>
<span class="p">)</span>

<span class="n">widget_router</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Router</span><span class="p">(</span>
    <span class="n">dependencies</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="s2">&quot;widget_dependency&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">Provide</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">some_widget_dependency</span><span class="p">)},</span>
    <span class="n">path</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;/widgets&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="n">route_handlers</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">[</span>
        <span class="n">get_widget</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="n">get_widget_list</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="n">_write_widget_router</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="p">]</span>
<span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This provides a single&nbsp;“public” <code>Router</code> instance with all the widget routes, all of which have access to the same core dependencies, but with the data-modifying routes also having auth applied. That composability is extremely powerful, and is less obvious if the “router” has to be introduced initially as a way to solve circular-import&nbsp;problems.</p>
<p>Litestar’s approach also means it’s easy to do things like register a single route multiple times, each with different configuration. Which enables use cases&nbsp;like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Different authentication/authorization schemes for each registration. For example, a data-editing route might be written once, and registered once under a router which applies <span class="caps">API</span> key auth for machine-to-machine requests, then registered again under a router which uses session auth for interaction by a human&nbsp;user.</li>
<li>Different sets of dependencies for each registration. For example, a route which queries and returns a list of widgets might just declare that it accepts an argument of&nbsp;type <code>WidgetRepository</code>, and leave it up to the router configuration to decide whether to dependency-inject one that sees all widgets, or perhaps only a subset, or only those which are active,&nbsp;etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you know what you’re doing, you can emulate some of this in the FastAPI/Flask style of bound route registration, but the techniques you&#8217;ll end up using for that feel to me like fighting against the framework, which is something I usually want to&nbsp;avoid.</p>
<h2>Not to be too&nbsp;Pydantic</h2>
<p><a href="https://docs.pydantic.dev/">Pydantic</a> is a popular package for defining schema objects which perform validation and serialization/deserialization, driven by Python type annotations, and one major use case for this is the input/output schemas of web applications. FastAPI appears to use Pydantic exclusively, which comes with both upsides and downsides. Pydantic is very useful and very powerful, of course, but it also means FastAPI is somewhat limited by what Pydantic can support: mostly, this is Pydantic’s own classes, and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html">the Python standard&nbsp;library’s <code>dataclasses</code></a>.</p>
<p>One crucial limitation is an inability to derive validation/serialization behavior directly from <a href="https://www.sqlalchemy.org">SQLAlchemy</a> <abbr title="Object-Relational Mapper"><span class="caps">ORM</span></abbr> classes, even though they both support a very similar type-annotation-based declaration format. Which means that to use SQLAlchemy with a Pydantic-only framework (and SQLAlchemy is basically <em>the</em> standard database toolkit and <abbr title="Object-Relational Mapper"><span class="caps">ORM</span></abbr> for Python), you either have to write out the shape of your data multiple times—once for SQLAlchemy, and then at least one more time (possibly more than one time) for Pydantic—or turn to a third-party package to help bridge the gap. FastAPI’s author worked around this by writing <a href="https://sqlmodel.tiangolo.com">a new <span class="caps">DB</span> toolkit which combines SQLAlchemy and Pydantic</a>, and pushing it in FastAPI’s&nbsp;documentation.</p>
<p>Litestar, meanwhile, <em>supports</em> Pydantic, but is not <em>tightly coupled to</em> Pydantic, which gives a bit more flexibility. By default Litestar lets you define input/output schemas using Pydantic&nbsp;models, <code>dataclasses</code>, or <a href="https://jcristharif.com/msgspec/">msgspec</a>; ships with plugins to enable the use of <a href="https://www.attrs.org/">attrs</a> and of SQLAlchemy models; and <a href="https://docs.litestar.dev/latest/usage/plugins/index.html#serializationpluginprotocol">provides a protocol for writing your own serialization plugins</a> to extend support to other kinds of&nbsp;objects.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s very convenient already, but the convenience is amplified by Litestar’s <a href="https://docs.litestar.dev/latest/usage/dto/1-abstract-dto.html">system for automatically deriving data-transfer objects</a> from data-access or domain objects. Suppose, for example, that we have the following SQLAlchemy model&nbsp;class:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kn">from</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nn">sqlalchemy.orm</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">DeclarativeBase</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">Mapped</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">mapped_column</span>

    <span class="n">name</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">Mapped</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">]</span>
    <span class="n">price_cents</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">Mapped</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nb">int</span><span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>In a Pydantic-only world, we’d need to write multiple Pydantic models representing different use&nbsp;cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>A “read” schema for use in <span class="caps">HTTP</span> responses, which would probably not include&nbsp;the <code>internal_notes</code> field and probably also&nbsp;not <code>id</code> (since <code>sku</code> is more likely to be the public&nbsp;identifier)</li>
<li>A “write” schema for creating widgets, which would&nbsp;exclude <code>id</code> since that likely is auto-generated on&nbsp;insert</li>
<li>Another “write” schema for updating widgets, setting all fields optional to allow partial&nbsp;update</li>
</ul>
<p>As well as possibly more schemas like an admin-view “read” schema that does include the internal fields, etc. Even if you get clever and use inheritance to share field definitions among all these Pydantic classes, you still will write out the full set of fields for widgets at least twice, and the second time it will be fragmented across multiple Pydantic classes, creating the risk of making a change to the <abbr title="Object-Relational Mapper"><span class="caps">ORM</span></abbr> model and forgetting to update all the corresponding field definitions in the Pydantic&nbsp;models.</p>
<p>Litestar’s approach is a significant improvement on this. For example, here’s how to use Litestar’s <abbr title="Data Transfer Object"><span class="caps">DTO</span></abbr> helpers to define the “read”&nbsp;schema:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kn">from</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nn">litestar.dto</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">DTOConfig</span>
<span class="kn">from</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nn">litestar.plugins.sqlalchemy</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">SQLAlchemyDTO</span>

<span class="k">class</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nc">ReadWidget</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">SQLAlchemyDTO</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">Widget</span><span class="p">]):</span>
    <span class="n">config</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">DTOConfig</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">exclude</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="s2">&quot;id&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;internal_notes&quot;</span><span class="p">})</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This will give you a <abbr title="Data Transfer Object"><span class="caps">DTO</span></abbr> class containing all the fields of&nbsp;the <code>Widget</code> <abbr title="Object-Relational Mapper"><span class="caps">ORM</span></abbr> model <em>except</em> the two explicitly excluded, and will derive that set of fields, and the correct data types, from&nbsp;introspecting <code>Widget</code>. It will also automatically handle conversion to and from instances&nbsp;of <code>Widget</code> when you specify it as the input or return <abbr title="Data Transfer Object"><span class="caps">DTO</span></abbr> type of a route. Similarly, it’s possible to declare a list of fields to include, or to re-map field names for public consumption, or to declare a <abbr title="Data Transfer Object"><span class="caps">DTO</span></abbr> which makes fields optional for partial updates. This means there’s only one canonical definition of the fields—on the original class, which might be a SQLAlchemy <abbr title="Object-Relational Mapper"><span class="caps">ORM</span></abbr> model, might be&nbsp;a <code>dataclass</code>, etc.—and it doesn’t have to be repeated in the DTOs because the DTOs will always derive their field definitions directly from the source class you point them&nbsp;at.</p>
<p>Of course, there are going to be cases where your DTOs are sufficiently different from your DAOs and domain objects that this isn’t a big help, but my own experience is that “the <abbr title="Data Transfer Object"><span class="caps">DTO</span></abbr> is a subset of the <abbr title="Data Access Object"><span class="caps">DAO</span></abbr>’s fields” is extremely common in real-world applications, so Litestar’s approach really pays off in both reduced boilerplate and reduced errors from manual “transcription” of fields between different class&nbsp;definitions.</p>
<h2>Alchemical&nbsp;architecture</h2>
<p>I wasn’t exaggerating earlier when I said that SQLAlchemy is <em>the</em> database toolkit and <abbr title="Object-Relational Mapper"><span class="caps">ORM</span></abbr> for Python. While there are others out there, the only one I’m aware of that sees anything close to SQLAlchemy’s usage is the Django <abbr title="Object-Relational Mapper"><span class="caps">ORM</span></abbr>, and only because it’s built into and tightly integrated with Django. So if you’re going to be writing a database-backed web application in Python, and you’re not doing Django, you are almost certainly going to be using&nbsp;SQLAlchemy.</p>
<p>And Litestar makes that easy. While officially remaining agnostic as to whether you even have a persistence layer, it still includes good integrations for SQLAlchemy: the serialization plugin mentioned earlier allows the direct use of SQLAlchemy <abbr title="Object-Relational Mapper"><span class="caps">ORM</span></abbr> classes as input and output schemas; the <abbr title="Data Transfer Object"><span class="caps">DTO</span></abbr> helpers can derive subsets and remappings of fields from SQLAlchemy <abbr title="Object-Relational Mapper"><span class="caps">ORM</span></abbr> classes; and Litestar also ships with <a href="https://docs.litestar.dev/latest/usage/databases/sqlalchemy/plugins/sqlalchemy_init_plugin.html">a plugin that manages a SQLAlchemy engine and per-request <abbr title="Object-Relational Mapper"><span class="caps">ORM</span></abbr> session for you</a>, as well as <a href="https://docs.litestar.dev/latest/usage/databases/sqlalchemy/plugins/sqlalchemy_plugin.html">a single SQLAlchemy mega-plugin</a> combining all the SQLAlchemy plugins’&nbsp;functionality.</p>
<p>So it’s already pretty convenient to use SQLAlchemy in Litestar applications. But there’s more! The Litestar team also maintains <a href="https://docs.advanced-alchemy.litestar.dev/latest/">the excellent Advanced Alchemy library</a> which provides a bunch of useful features on top of SQLAlchemy. While Advanced Alchemy is framework-agnostic, Litestar’s SQLAlchemy plugin makes use of it and re-exports much of its functionality, giving you access to it automatically, and it does include Litestar-specific helpers for registering certain utility classes with Litestar’s dependency&nbsp;injection.</p>
<p>Advanced Alchemy provides a lot of quality-of-life improvements for SQLAlchemy, including a variety of base classes and mixins and data types doing useful things like database-agnostic big-integer primary keys, automatic create/update timestamps, <abbr title="Universally Unique IDentifier"><span class="caps">UUID</span></abbr>-keyed models, a proper <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time"><span class="caps">UTC</span></abbr> timestamp type, and a <abbr title="JavaScript Object Notation"><span class="caps">JSON</span></abbr> type which chooses the best column type for your database. There are also command-line helpers for database management (including creating and working with <a href="https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/">Alembic migrations</a>), database dumping and seeding to/from <abbr title="JavaScript Object Notation"><span class="caps">JSON</span></abbr>, and a lot&nbsp;more.</p>
<p>But the place where Advanced Alchemy really shines is in providing <a href="https://docs.advanced-alchemy.litestar.dev/latest/usage/repositories.html">a generic repository implementation</a> (both sync and async flavors) on top of SQLAlchemy models, along with <a href="https://docs.advanced-alchemy.litestar.dev/latest/usage/services.html">a service-layer abstraction</a> and helpers to integrate them into Litestar’s dependency injection&nbsp;system.</p>
<p>Here’s a basic example using&nbsp;the <code>Widget</code> class from&nbsp;above:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kn">from</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nn">litestar.plugins.sqlalchemy</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">repository</span>

<span class="k">class</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nc">WidgetRepository</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">repository</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">SQLAlchemyAsyncRepository</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">Widget</span><span class="p">]):</span>
    <span class="n">model_type</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Widget</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p><code>WidgetRepository</code> will have all the methods you’d&nbsp;expect—<code>list()</code>, <code>get_one()</code>, <code>add()</code>, <code>delete()</code>, etc.—automatically derived from&nbsp;the <code>Widget</code> model. And let me just say that having repository implementations automatically derived from any SQLAlchemy model, with not just basic <abbr title="Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete"><span class="caps">CRUD</span></abbr> operations but also things like paginated fetches, is a <em>massive</em> productivity boost compared to just using vanilla SQLAlchemy. It’s maybe not quite on the level of Django’s generic views, but it’s a big step in that direction, and you probably could produce something like Django’s generic views with Litestar and Advanced Alchemy if you wanted to (perhaps one day, in my copious free time, I’ll even make an attempt at&nbsp;it).</p>
<p>I know it may seem strange to hear me saying this, since a few years ago I went on record as being strongly <em>against</em> these sorts of abstractions—specifically service layers—in Django. And I still think you absolutely should not try to retrofit repository or service-layer abstractions onto Django! They’re not the native patterns of Django’s architecture, and instead I think you should stick to <a href="/weblog/2020/mar/16/no-service/">what I recommended back then</a>, which is to leverage Django’s own architecture, especially its “manager” abstraction, rather than trying to force abstractions onto it that don’t&nbsp;fit.</p>
<p>I also still think there are a lot of bad use cases for repositories and service layers that people should avoid, but that’s a digression which should probably become its own post, so I’ll just say for now that I think it’s fine to use repositories and service layers <em>as an organizing principle</em> when you’re using a less-structured framework which doesn’t express strong opinions about how you should lay out your code. And that’s exactly what I do when working with&nbsp;Litestar.</p>
<h2>A lightweight star of&nbsp;Python</h2>
<p>There are plenty of other features and conveniences in Litestar, many of which I use daily. Its auth system, supporting both <a href="https://docs.litestar.dev/latest/usage/security/guards.html">simple guard functions</a> and <a href="https://docs.litestar.dev/latest/usage/security/abstract-authentication-middleware.html">middlewares</a> for attaching identity and complex authn/authz logic to requests. Its <a href="https://docs.litestar.dev/latest/usage/stores.html">“stores” framework</a>, which makes caching and similar tasks convenient. Its <a href="https://docs.litestar.dev/latest/usage/logging.html">logging integrations</a> which support both the Python standard&nbsp;library’s <code>logging</code> module and popular third-party tools&nbsp;like <code>structlog</code>. Its built-in support for <a href="https://docs.litestar.dev/latest/usage/plugins/problem_details.html">transforming errors to standard &#8220;problem details&#8221; structures</a>. Its built-in support for <a href="https://docs.litestar.dev/latest/usage/metrics/index.html">recording and exporting metrics in standard Prometheus or OpenTelemetry formats</a>. Its <a href="https://docs.litestar.dev/latest/usage/htmx.html">htmx support</a>.</p>
<p>You can do this stuff in other microframeworks, but it typically involves a lot of tracking down of third-party add-ons and/or writing your own glue code to integrate things. Litestar manages to keep the “microframework” feel when starting a new project while also having all these nice bits optionally available with the framework itself when and if you decide you want them, and that’s nothing to sneeze at. That’s what I was getting at earlier when I said it reminds me of the things I like in certain frameworks from other languages. Litestar doesn’t feel, to me, like it’s trying to be a replacement for any pre-existing Python web framework. It’s not trying to be the next Django or the next Flask or whatever; instead, it feels to me like a Pythonic take on the good parts of something like Spring Boot (and the way I like to set it up, doing things like using <a href="https://svcs.hynek.me/en/stable/">svcs</a> behind the scenes as a service locator to feed things to both Litestar’s and <a href="https://docs.pytest.org/">pytest’s</a> dependency injection, makes it feel even more that&nbsp;way).</p>
<p>I could go on for a lot longer listing things I like about Litestar, and probably wind up way too far into my own subjective preferences, but hopefully I’ve given you enough of a realistic taste of what it offers that, next time you’re about to build a Python web app, you might decide to reach for 💡⭐ to carry you to the moon&nbsp;🚀🚀🚀.</p>

            <p>مرحبًا بالجميع، كيف حالكم؟ أصدرت الصين أداة برمجة مجانية للجميع، وهذه أداة مختلفة تمامًا عن كل الأدوات التي تحدثنا عنها في هذا المنشور. وسأوضح لكم الفرق بينها وبين كل الأدوات التي شرحناها، حيث تناولنا أكثر من 50 أداة في مواقع تصمم تطبيقات وتكتب أكوادًا. هذا المقال مختلف قليلًا، وسأوضح لكم السبب.</p>

<p>هذا هو الموقع الرسمي للأداة التي تسمى CodeGeeX. موقعهم متاح باللغة الصينية واللغة الإنجليزية كما ترون. هذه الأداة هي مشروع مفتوح المصدر من الصين يمكنك تحميله على جهازك، وسأشرح لكم كيفية تحميله أيضًا. يتم تثبيته داخل Visual Studio Code أو داخل JetBrains. كما ترون، إذا ضغطتم على “Get Extension”، ستظهر لكم الأماكن التي يمكنكم تثبيت أداة اليوم فيها.</p>

<h3 id="ماذا-تفعل-الأداة-وماذا-تدعم">ماذا تفعل الأداة وماذا تدعم؟</h3>
<p>حسنًا، ماذا تفعل هذه الأداة وما هي الأكواد التي تدعمها؟ هذه هي البيئات التي يمكنك تثبيت الإضافة وتشغيلها بداخلها، وهذه هي اللغات التي تدعمها:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Python</li>
  <li>JavaScript</li>
  <li>TypeScript</li>
  <li>C++</li>
  <li>Java</li>
  <li>Go</li>
  <li>PHP</li>
  <li>C#</li>
  <li>والعديد من لغات البرمجة الأخرى.</li>
</ul>

<p>هي مجانية تمامًا للأفراد الذين يمكنهم استخدامها. ولديهم خدمة إذا كنت شركة وتريد استخدام نموذج داخل أجهزتك، فيمكنك التواصل معهم من خلال الموقع. في قسم الأسئلة الشائعة، يُذكر أن CodeGeeX مجاني تمامًا للمستخدمين الأفراد. وهو أيضًا مفتوح المصدر، وإذا أردت تثبيته، ستجد الصفحة، تضغط على “انتقل إلى GitHub”، وستجد المشروع هناك ويمكنك عمل <code class="highlighter-rouge">clone</code> له.</p>

<h3 id="كيفية-التثبيت-في-visual-studio-code">كيفية التثبيت في Visual Studio Code</h3>
<p>لنقم أولًا بتثبيته كإضافة داخل Visual Studio Code.</p>
<ol>
  <li>عند فتح Visual Studio Code، اضغط على <code class="highlighter-rouge">File</code> ثم <code class="highlighter-rouge">Open Folder</code>.</li>
  <li>أنشئ مجلدًا جديدًا لمشروعك وحدده.</li>
  <li>سيظهر المشروع فارغًا. في شريط البحث عن الإضافات، اكتب <code class="highlighter-rouge">CodeGeeX</code>.</li>
  <li>سيظهر لك خياران، اختر الذي يحمل العلامة المميزة لـ CodeGeeX وقم بتثبيته بالضغط على <code class="highlighter-rouge">Install</code>.</li>
  <li>بعد التثبيت، ستظهر أيقونة الأداة في الشريط الجانبي.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="الإعدادات-الأولية">الإعدادات الأولية</h3>
<p>عندما تفتحها لأول مرة، ستكون باللغة الصينية. لتغيير اللغة، تضغط على النقاط الثلاث ثم على <code class="highlighter-rouge">CodeGeeX Settings</code>. من هناك، تبدأ في اختيار حجم الخط وتختار اللغة الإنجليزية (EN). ستجدها في البداية على (CN)، فتقوم بتغييرها إلى اللغة الإنجليزية لتتمكن من الاستفادة منها.</p>

<p>بعد ذلك، يجب عليك تسجيل الدخول لتتمكن من استخدامها. تضغط على <code class="highlighter-rouge">Login</code> ثم <code class="highlighter-rouge">Open</code>. يمكنك تسجيل الدخول باستخدام Google، GitHub، أو أي خيار آخر، أو من خلال البريد الإلكتروني.</p>

<h3 id="النماذج-المتاحة">النماذج المتاحة</h3>
<p>هي تدعم نماذج مثل <code class="highlighter-rouge">Claude Sonnet 4</code> و <code class="highlighter-rouge">Claude Sonnet 3.5</code>، بالإضافة إلى <code class="highlighter-rouge">CodeGeeX Pro</code> وهو النموذج مفتوح المصدر. يمكنك استخدامه أيضًا في الوضع المحلي (Local Mode).</p>

<p>ستجد خيارين رئيسيين: <code class="highlighter-rouge">Ask</code> و <code class="highlighter-rouge">Agent</code>.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Ask</strong>: هو عبارة عن محادثة يمكنك من خلالها طرح أي سؤال برمجي.</li>
  <li><strong>Agent</strong>: هو وضع الوكيل الذي يقوم بتنفيذ المهام. قد لا يظهر هذا الخيار من المرة الأولى؛ قد تحتاج إلى إعادة تشغيل Visual Studio Code مرتين أو ثلاث مرات حتى يظهر.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="العمل-بدون-اتصال-بالإنترنت-local-mode">العمل بدون اتصال بالإنترنت (Local Mode)</h3>
<p>لديك أيضًا في الاختيارات <code class="highlighter-rouge">Local Model</code>، حيث يمكنك تثبيت نموذج محلي. لديهم نموذج خاص بهم اسمه <code class="highlighter-rouge">CodeGeeX-All-9B</code>. هذا النموذج يعمل بدون اتصال بالإنترنت وحجمه يتراوح بين 4 و 8 جيجابايت. يمكنك استخدامه بدون إنترنت، ولكن يجب أن يكون جهازك قويًا بعض الشيء.</p>

<p>عند محاولة استخدامه، سيخبرك أنه يجب تثبيت نموذج. بالضغط على <code class="highlighter-rouge">Model Configuration</code>، سيعطيك تعليمات لربطه بالـ <code class="highlighter-rouge">localhost</code> الخاص بك. يمكنك اتباع التعليمات الموجودة في صفحة <code class="highlighter-rouge">Local Mode</code> لتثبيته بنجاح.</p>

<h3 id="مثال-عملي-إنشاء-صفحة-ويب-بسيطة">مثال عملي: إنشاء صفحة ويب بسيطة</h3>
<p>سأعود لاستخدام الوضع المتصل بالإنترنت (<code class="highlighter-rouge">Online Mode</code>) وأختار وضع <code class="highlighter-rouge">Agent</code>. يستخدم هذا الوضع نموذجهم الخاص الذي تم تدريبه على 9 مليار معاملة، ويمكنه إكمال الكود وتفسيره وإصلاحه وتحويله من لغة برمجة إلى أخرى.</p>

<p>في المربع المخصص، سأطلب منه: “أنشئ صفحة ويب بسيطة”.
سيبدأ CodeGeeX في كتابة الكود. بعد الانتهاء، تضغط على <code class="highlighter-rouge">Accept All</code> لحفظ الملفات.</p>

          <p class="text-base-content">
            <p>أهلاً وسهلاً بكم. من أكثر الأمور في نظام التشغيل ويندوز التي تستهلك الكثير من موارد الجهاز هي كثرة عمل الخدمات في الخلفية. كلما زاد عدد العمليات لنظام التشغيل والبرامج في الخلفية، زادت نسبة استهلاك موارد الجهاز مثل الرامات، المعالج، كارت الشاشة، والإنترنت، وهو ما يتسبب في بطء أداء ويندوز.</p>

<p>في المقابل، كلما قل عدد العمليات التي تعمل في الخلفية على نظام التشغيل، تحسن أداء النظام بنسبة كبيرة جداً. تقليل عدد العمليات في الخلفية يعني تقليل استهلاك موارد الجهاز. لذلك، يوجد إعداد بسيط جداً ومخفي في ويندوز بإمكانه تقليل نسبة كبيرة من عدد العمليات التي تعمل في الخلفية، وبالتالي ستشعر بتحسن كبير وملحوظ في أداء نظام التشغيل.</p>

<h3 id="ملاحظة-عدد-العمليات-الحالية">ملاحظة عدد العمليات الحالية</h3>
<p>للبداية، يمكننا إلقاء نظرة على عدد العمليات الحالية عبر مدير المهام في ويندوز 10 أو 11:</p>
<ol>
  <li>انقر بزر الماوس الأيمن على قائمة “ابدأ” (Start).</li>
  <li>اختر <strong>مدير المهام (Task Manager)</strong>.</li>
  <li>انتقل إلى تبويب <strong>الأداء (Performance)</strong>.</li>
  <li>اضغط على <strong>وحدة المعالجة المركزية (CPU)</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>ستجد عدد العمليات (Processes) الحالية. في هذا المثال، كان العدد <strong>176 عملية</strong>. قد يكون هذا الرقم أكبر لديك، مما يسبب استهلاكاً عالياً لموارد جهازك.</p>

<h2 id="الحل-تعديل-سجلات-ويندوز-registry">الحل: تعديل سجلات ويندوز (Registry)</h2>
<p>يوجد إعداد مخفي في النظام يمكن تعديله لتقليل عدد العمليات بشكل ملحوظ. هذا التعديل سيجعل كل خدمة تعمل بشكل منفصل بدلاً من تجميعها معاً، مما يقلل من استهلاك الموارد.</p>

<h3 id="خطوات-التعديل">خطوات التعديل</h3>
<ol>
  <li>من مربع البحث، اكتب <code class="highlighter-rouge">regedit</code> وافتح <strong>محرر السجلات (Registry Editor)</strong>.</li>
  <li>وافق على منح الأذونات بالضغط على “نعم” (Yes).</li>
  <li>في محرر السجلات، انتقل إلى المسار التالي:
    <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>ابحث عن قيمة باسم <strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">SvcHostSplitThresholdInKB</code></strong>. هذه هي القيمة المسؤولة عن تجميع الخدمات.</li>
  <li>انقر نقراً مزدوجاً عليها لتعديلها.</li>

<p>يجب إدخال قيمة محددة بناءً على حجم الذاكرة العشوائية (RAM) المثبتة على جهازك. لمعرفة حجم الذاكرة:</p>
<ul>
  <li>افتح <strong>مدير المهام (Task Manager)</strong> مرة أخرى.</li>
  <li>اذهب إلى <strong>الأداء (Performance)</strong> ثم <strong>الذاكرة (Memory)</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>بناءً على حجم الذاكرة لديك، استخدم القيمة المقابلة من القائمة التالية:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>8 جيجابايت رام:</strong> <code class="highlighter-rouge">800000</code></li>
  <li><strong>12 جيجابايت رام:</strong> <code class="highlighter-rouge">1200000</code></li>
  <li><strong>16 جيجابايت رام:</strong> <code class="highlighter-rouge">1600000</code></li>
  <li><strong>وأكثر:</strong> استمر بنفس النمط (مثلاً، 32 جيجابايت تكون <code class="highlighter-rouge">3200000</code>).</li>
</ul>

<p>في هذا المثال، الجهاز يحتوي على 8 جيجابايت، لذا تم حذف القيمة الافتراضية (التي قد تكون <code class="highlighter-rouge">380000</code>) وكتابة <code class="highlighter-rouge">800000</code>.</p>

<ol>
  <li>بعد إدخال الرقم الصحيح، اضغط على <strong>OK</strong> وأغلق محرر السجلات.</li>
  <li><strong>مهم:</strong> قم بإعادة تشغيل جهاز الكمبيوتر لتطبيق التغييرات.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="النتيجة-بعد-إعادة-التشغيل">النتيجة بعد إعادة التشغيل</h3>
<p>بعد إعادة تشغيل الجهاز، عند فتح مدير المهام مرة أخرى والتوجه إلى <strong>Performance &gt; CPU</strong>، ستلاحظ انخفاضاً كبيراً في عدد العمليات. في حالتنا، انخفض العدد من <strong>177</strong> إلى <strong>118</strong> عملية.</p>

<p>هذا الانخفاض في عدد العمليات سيحسن من أداء جهاز الكمبيوتر ويقلل من استهلاك موارد الجهاز مثل وحدة المعالجة المركزية، الذاكرة، الإنترنت، وبطاقة الرسوميات.</p>

<h2 id="خلاصة">خلاصة</h2>
<p>كما رأينا في هذا المقال، هذا إعداد مهم جداً يجب عليك تغييره لتحسين أداء ويندوز بشكل ملحوظ.</p>

          <p class="text-base-content">
            <p>مرحباً بكم. في هذا المقال، نستعرض لكم أفضل طريقة يمكنكم استخدامها لتثبيت أي إصدار من ويندوز بدون الحاجة إلى ذاكرة فلاش (USB) أو أي برامج خارجية. يمكنكم تثبيت أي إصدار من ويندوز مباشرة من جهاز الكمبيوتر نفسه.</p>

<p>على سبيل المثال، إذا كنتم تريدون تثبيت ويندوز 10، ويندوز 7، ويندوز 8، أو ويندوز 11، سواء كان جهازكم مدعوماً أم غير مدعوم، يمكنكم استخدام هذه الطريقة.</p>

<p>كل ما تحتاجونه هو ملف ISO الخاص بنسخة الويندوز التي تريدون تثبيتها. سنطبق هذا الشرح على تثبيت ويندوز 11، ولكن يمكنكم تطبيق نفس الخطوات على أي إصدار ويندوز آخر ترغبون في تثبيته.</p>

<h3 id="الخطوة-الأولى-إنشاء-قسم-جديد-على-القرص-الصلب">الخطوة الأولى: إنشاء قسم جديد على القرص الصلب</h3>

<p>المطلوب هو إنشاء قسم (Partition) جديد بحجم 10 جيجابايت لوضع ملفات نسخة الويندوز التي سنبدأ في تثبيتها.</p>

<ol>
  <li>انقر بزر الماوس الأيمن على قائمة ابدأ (Start)، ثم اختر <strong>إدارة الأقراص (Disk Management)</strong>.</li>
  <li>من القرص (C) أو أي قرص آخر متوفر لديكم، انقر بزر الماوس الأيمن عليه ثم اضغط على <strong>تقليص وحدة التخزين (Shrink Volume)</strong>.</li>
  <li>في الحقل المحدد، اكتب <code class="highlighter-rouge">9000</code> ميجابايت، وهو ما يعادل حوالي 8.5 جيجابايت، وهذا كافٍ.</li>
  <li>اضغط على <strong>تقليص (Shrink)</strong>. سيبدأ في إنشاء قسم جديد غير مستخدم كمساحة غير مخصصة (Unallocated Space).</li>
  <li>انقر بزر الماوس الأيمن على المساحة غير المخصصة، ثم اختر <strong>وحدة تخزين بسيطة جديدة (New Simple Volume)</strong>.</li>
  <li>اتبع المعالج بالضغط على <strong>التالي (Next)</strong> ثم <strong>التالي (Next)</strong>، وأخيراً <strong>إنهاء (Finish)</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>بهذا تم إنشاء قسم جديد بمساحة 8 جيجابايت تقريباً.</p>

<h3 id="الخطوة-الثانية-نسخ-ملفات-تثبيت-الويندوز">الخطوة الثانية: نسخ ملفات تثبيت الويندوز</h3>

<ol>
  <li>توجه إلى ملف ISO الخاص بنسخة الويندوز، انقر عليه بزر الماوس الأيمن واختر <strong>تحميل (Mount)</strong>، أو انقر عليه نقراً مزدوجاً.</li>
  <li>ستُفتح محتويات نسخة الويندوز. حدد جميع الملفات وانسخها (Copy).</li>
  <li>توجه إلى <strong>“هذا الكمبيوتر” (This PC)</strong>. ستجد القسم الجديد الذي أنشأناه بمساحة 8 جيجابايت.</li>
  <li>افتح القسم الجديد، وانقر بزر الماوس الأيمن ثم <strong>لصق (Paste)</strong> لوضع محتويات نسخة الويندوز.</li>
  <li>بعد انتهاء النقل، ارجع للخلف وقم بإعادة تسمية هذا القسم ليسهل التعرف عليه أثناء التثبيت. انقر عليه بزر الماوس الأيمن، اختر <strong>إعادة تسمية (Rename)</strong>، وسمّه على سبيل المثال: <code class="highlighter-rouge">install windows 11</code>.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="الخطوة-الثالثة-بدء-عملية-التثبيت">الخطوة الثالثة: بدء عملية التثبيت</h3>

<p>إذا كان لديكم مشاكل في جهاز الكمبيوتر ولا يعمل، ولا يوجد ذاكرة فلاش أو قرص صلب خارجي، يمكنكم تثبيت ويندوز جديد بهذه الطريقة.</p>

<ol>
  <li>اضغط على قائمة ابدأ (Start)، ثم على أيقونة الطاقة (Power).</li>
  <li>اضغط على مفتاح <strong>Shift</strong> باستمرار ثم انقر على <strong>إعادة التشغيل (Restart)</strong>.</li>
  <li>سيتم إعادة تشغيل الجهاز وتحويلكم إلى إعدادات بدء التشغيل المتقدمة.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="الدخول-إلى-موجه-الأوامر">الدخول إلى موجه الأوامر</h4>

<ol>
  <li>في شاشة الخيارات، اضغط على <strong>استكشاف الأخطاء وإصلاحها (Troubleshoot)</strong>.</li>
  <li>ثم اضغط على <strong>خيارات متقدمة (Advanced options)</strong>.</li>
  <li>ثم اختر <strong>موجه الأوامر (Command Prompt)</strong>.</li>
  <li>اختر اسم المستخدم الخاص بك. إذا كان جهازكم محمياً بكلمة مرور، فأدخلها ثم اضغط <strong>متابعة (Continue)</strong>. إذا لم يكن هناك كلمة مرور، اترك الحقل فارغاً واضغط <strong>متابعة (Continue)</strong>.</li>
  <li>سيفتح موجه الأوامر. اكتب الأمر التالي واضغط على Enter:
    <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>notepad
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>من قائمة <strong>ملف (File)</strong> في Notepad، اضغط على <strong>فتح (Open)</strong>.</li>
  <li>توجه إلى <strong>“هذا الكمبيوتر” (This PC)</strong>. ستظهر لكم الأقراص. كل ما نحتاجه هو معرفة حرف القرص الذي وضعنا فيه ملفات الويندوز. ستلاحظون أننا سمينا القسم <code class="highlighter-rouge">install windows 11</code>، والحرف المخصص له هو (D)، وهذا هو الحرف الذي نحتاجه.</li>
  <li>أغلق نافذة الفتح وعد إلى موجه الأوامر.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="تشغيل-ملف-التثبيت">تشغيل ملف التثبيت</h4>

<ol>
  <li>اكتب حرف القسم متبوعاً بنقطتين رأسيتين، ثم اضغط Enter. في حالتنا:
    <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>D:
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>اكتب الأمر التالي لعرض محتويات القسم:
    <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>dir
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>ستظهر الملفات، ومن بينها ملف <code class="highlighter-rouge">setup.exe</code>. لتشغيله، اكتب الأمر التالي واضغط Enter:
    <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>setup.exe
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>سيبدأ معالج تثبيت ويندوز مباشرة.</p>

<h4 id="تجاوز-متطلبات-التشغيل-لويندوز-11">تجاوز متطلبات التشغيل (لويندوز 11)</h4>

<p>إذا كنتم تثبتون ويندوز 11 على جهاز مدعوم، يمكنكم استكمال الخطوات بشكل طبيعي. أما إذا كان جهازكم غير مدعوم، فستظهر رسالة تفيد بأن الجهاز لا يلبي المتطلبات (مثلاً، لا يحتوي على TPM 2.0 أو ذاكرة RAM أقل من 4 جيجابايت).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>ملاحظة:</strong> دائماً ما يُنصح بعدم تثبيت ويندوز 11 على جهاز لا يحتوي على 8 جيجابايت من الذاكرة العشوائية (RAM) على الأقل للحصول على تجربة استخدام سلسة.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>لتجاوز هذه المشكلة:</p>
<ol>
  <li>أغلق نافذة التثبيت بالضغط على <strong>إغلاق (Close)</strong>.</li>
  <li>في موجه الأوامر، اكتب الأمر التالي بدقة. هذا الأمر يتجاوز فحص المتطلبات.
    <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>setup.exe /product server
</code></pre></div>    </div>
    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>تنبيه:</strong> تأكدوا من أن الأمر مكتوب بهذا الشكل تماماً، بما في ذلك المسافات والنقطة.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>اضغط على Enter. سيبدأ معالج التثبيت مرة أخرى، ولكن هذه المرة سيتجاوز فحص المتطلبات.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="تهيئة-القرص-ومتابعة-التثبيت">تهيئة القرص ومتابعة التثبيت</h4>

<ol>
  <li>اتبع خطوات التثبيت الأولية (اللغة، المنطقة، إلخ).</li>
  <li>اضغط على <code class="highlighter-rouge">I don't have a product key</code>.</li>
  <li>اختر إصدار الويندوز الذي تريد تثبيته (مثلاً، Pro) ثم <strong>التالي (Next)</strong>.</li>
  <li>وافق على شروط الترخيص.</li>
  <li>ستصل إلى مرحلة اختيار القرص.
    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>تنبيه هام:</strong> انتبهوا إلى أن القسم المسمى <code class="highlighter-rouge">install windows 11</code> (حجمه حوالي 8-9 جيجابايت) هو القسم الذي يحتوي على ملفات التثبيت، لذا <strong>لا تقم بتهيئته أو حذفه</strong>.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>حدد القرص الآخر الذي تريد تثبيت الويندوز عليه (عادة ما يكون القرص الأساسي (Primary) ويمكن التعرف عليه من مساحته).</li>
  <li>حدد ذلك القرص ثم اضغط على <strong>تهيئة (Format)</strong>. انتظر حتى تكتمل العملية.</li>
  <li>تأكد من أن المساحة الإجمالية للقرص أصبحت نفس المساحة الحرة (Free Space).</li>
  <li>حدد القرص المهيأ مرة أخرى واضغط على <strong>التالي (Next)</strong>.</li>
  <li>ستظهر شاشة تأكيد. اضغط على <strong>تثبيت (Install)</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>سيبدأ الويندوز الآن في نسخ الملفات وإكمال عملية التثبيت.</p>

<h3 id="الخطوة-الرابعة-إعدادات-ما-بعد-التثبيت">الخطوة الرابعة: إعدادات ما بعد التثبيت</h3>

<p>بعد إعادة التشغيل، سيقوم الويندوز بإكمال الإعدادات.</p>

<h4 id="تجاوز-إنشاء-حساب-مايكروسوفت">تجاوز إنشاء حساب مايكروسوفت</h4>

<p>عندما تصل إلى مرحلة إضافة حساب مايكروسوفت، إذا كنتم لا ترغبون في استخدامه وتفضلون حساباً محلياً:</p>
<ol>
  <li>اضغط على مفتاحي <code class="highlighter-rouge">Shift + F10</code> لفتح موجه الأوامر.</li>
  <li>اكتب الأمر التالي ثم اضغط على Enter:
    <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>start ms-cxh:localonly
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>ستظهر نافذة لإنشاء حساب محلي. في الحقل الأول، اكتب اسم المستخدم.</li>
  <li>إذا أردت إضافة كلمة مرور، اكتبها في الحقلين التاليين. إذا لم ترد، اتركهما فارغين.</li>
  <li>اضغط على <strong>التالي (Next)</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>سيتم تجاوز خطوة حساب مايكروسوفت، وسيكمل الويندوز الإعدادات النهائية ثم يأخذك إلى سطح المكتب.</p>

<h3 id="الخطوة-الخامسة-استعادة-مساحة-القسم-اختياري">الخطوة الخامسة: استعادة مساحة القسم (اختياري)</h3>

<p>بعد العودة إلى سطح المكتب، القسم الذي أنشأناه في البداية لا يزال موجوداً. يمكنكم تركه كنسخة احتياطية لتثبيت الويندوز مستقبلاً بسهولة. إذا أردتم حذف القسم واستعادة مساحته:</p>

<ol>
  <li>توجه إلى <strong>إدارة الأقراص (Disk Management)</strong>.</li>
  <li>ابحث عن القسم المسمى <code class="highlighter-rouge">install windows 11</code>. انقر عليه بزر الماوس الأيمن واختر <strong>حذف وحدة التخزين (Delete Volume)</strong>.</li>
  <li>إذا كانت المساحة المحذوفة بجوار القرص (C) مباشرة، انقر بزر الماوس الأيمن على (C) واختر <strong>توسيع وحدة التخزين (Extend Volume)</strong> لدمج المساحة.</li>
  <li>إذا كان هناك قسم استرداد (Recovery) يفصل بينهما، فستحتاج إلى أداة خارجية مثل <strong>MiniTool Partition Wizard</strong>.
    <ul>
      <li>ابحث عن البرنامج وقم بتنزيل النسخة المجانية.</li>
      <li>بعد التثبيت، افتح البرنامج.</li>
      <li>انقر بزر الماوس الأيمن على القرص (C) واختر <strong>Extend</strong>.</li>
      <li>حدد المساحة غير المخصصة (Unallocated Space) واسحب شريط التمرير إلى النهاية.</li>
      <li>اضغط <strong>OK</strong> ثم <strong>Apply</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>سيتم دمج المساحة مرة أخرى في القرص الرئيسي.</p>

          <p class="text-base-content">
            <p>اليوم سأشارككم أدوات الذكاء الاصطناعي التي أستخدمها كل يوم، والتي أصبحت جزءًا لا يتجزأ مني ومن حياتي ولا أستطيع العيش بدونها. يأتي هذا بعد محاولات وتجارب عديدة مع أدوات كثيرة جدًا، بعضها كان مفيدًا بالفعل وبعضها استخدمته مرة واحدة ولم أكرر التجربة. لذلك، أتيتكم اليوم بالخلاصة. لا تقلقوا، فأغلب أو كل الأدوات التي أستخدمها مجانية، وستتمكنون من تجربة كل الأدوات التي أستخدمها اليوم مجانًا. إذا كنتم مهتمين بالذكاء الاصطناعي والمستقبل والأعمال، فكونوا متابعين أولاً بأول لأن الفترة القادمة سنتحدث كثيرًا عن هذه الأمور. بدون إطالة، لنبدأ.</p>

<h3 id="1-chatgpt">1. ChatGPT</h3>
<p>أول وأشهر وأقوى أداة ذكاء اصطناعي أستخدمها يوميًا. بالطبع، لقد خمنتم جميعكم الأداة الآن، وهي ChatGPT، أشهر أداة ذكاء اصطناعي في العالم حاليًا، وأنا أستخدمها تقريبًا في كل شيء.</p>

<p>على سبيل المثال:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>التعلم والمذاكرة:</strong> عندما أذاكر ويصادفني شيء لا أفهمه، ألجأ إليه لسؤاله على الفور. قد يقول قائل الآن: “أي مذاكرة هذه، ألم تتخرج بالفعل؟”. يا صديقي، الطبيب يذاكر طوال عمره. وبشكل عام، أي شيء جديد أريد أن أتعلمه الآن، فبدلاً من البحث عن دورات تدريبية، يساعدني ChatGPT في هذا الموضوع في ثوانٍ. وإذا لم أفهم الأمر، أجعله يشرح لي بأكثر من طريقة وأسلوب حتى أفهمه جيدًا. سأريكم مثالاً عملياً على ذلك في مقال قادم، حيث سننشئ فيه تطبيق جوال من الصفر حتى نصل إلى تطبيقًا كاملاً يعمل على الجوال ويمكنكم تجربته وتنزيله بأنفسكم، كل هذا دون كتابة سطر برمجي واحد ودون أن أكون على دراية بأي شيء عن برمجة تطبيقات الجوال. وبالمناسبة، أنا لم أنشئ تطبيق جوال كاملاً في حياتي من قبل، لذا ستكون تجربة قوية جدًا، آمل ذلك.</li>
  <li><strong>صناعة المحتوى:</strong> عندما أشرع في إعداد مقال جديد، يساعدني ChatGPT في إعداد المسودة، لأنه ينبهني إلى نقاط كثيرة ربما لم أكن منتبهًا لها أو قد نسيتها. هو لا يكتب لي المسودة بالكامل، ولكنه يساعدني كثيرًا ويلفت نظري لأمور لا أكون منتبهًا لها في أوقات كثيرة. وأحيانًا يقترح عليّ أفكار مقالات جيدة لأكتبها، لذلك هو يساعدني في صناعة المحتوى كثيرًا الآن وسهّل عليّ كل شيء.</li>
  <li><strong>تخطيط الأعمال:</strong> إذا قررت أن أبدأ عملاً تجاريًا جديدًا، مثل المشاريع التي جربناها من قبل أو التي أجهز لها في هذه الفترة، فألجأ إليه لأسأله وأفهم منه ما هي الأمور التي يجب أن أنتبه إليها، وماذا سأحتاج أن أتعلم بالضبط، وما هو الفريق الذي سأحتاجه، وما هو نموذج العمل الخاص بي، وهكذا. وهو بالفعل يفيدني كثيرًا في هذا الموضوع.</li>
</ul>

<p>باختصار، ChatGPT هو ذراعي الأيمن في كل شيء في حياتي الآن. أي شيء يتعطل معي، أي مشكلة، أي أمر أحتاج فيه إلى رأي شخص ما أو نصائح في الحياة بشكل عام، أيًا كان، ستجده عونًا لك حقًا.</p>

<p>حقًا، إذا لم تكن تستخدمه، يجب أن تبدأ في استخدامه الآن، لأنه عن تجربة سيغير حياتك 180 درجة وسيسهل عليك كل شيء، وستقول لنفسك: “كيف لم أكن أستخدمه طوال الفترة الماضية؟”. لدي صديق كل عمله متعلق بالمحاماة والقضاء وهذه الأمور، لم يكن يستخدم ChatGPT على الإطلاق من قبل، ولكن عندما عرفته عليه وكيفية استخدامه، عاد إليّ في اليوم التالي منبهرًا جدًا بالموضوع ويقول لي إنه أمضى الليلة بأكملها يتحدث معه في مواضيع مختلفة وجعله يحلل القضايا وما إلى ذلك، وظل يسأله في أمور كثيرة جدًا وغير مصدق كيف أنه طوال الفترة الماضية لم يكن يعلم بوجود أداة كهذه.</p>

<p>فحقًا، إذا لم تجربه حتى الآن، فقد فاتك الكثير. وسيكون هناك مقال قريب جدًا أجهزه الآن، سنشرح فيه ChatGPT كما لم تعرفه من قبل، بكل استخداماته الممكنة في مختلف مجالات الحياة، وسأريك كمية الميزات والإمكانيات الموجودة فيه التي لن تصدق وجودها. ستنبهرون في النهاية.</p>

<p>مشكلته الوحيدة حاليًا هي أنه عند استخدامه مجانًا، يكون لك حد استخدام يومي، وعندما تنهي هذا الحد، يجعلك تستخدم نموذج ذكاء اصطناعي أقل ذكاءً، وأنا لا أحب ذلك بصراحة.</p>

<h3 id="2-grok">2. Grok</h3>
<p>عندما يحدث ذلك، ألجأ إلى ثاني أكثر أداة أحبها، وهي Grok من شركة xAI التابعة لإيلون ماسك. هذه من أجمل أدوات الذكاء الاصطناعي التي جربتها بصراحة وأحبها جدًا، وكانت مفاجأة بالنسبة لي. إنها أداة رائعة وتساعدك أيضًا في أغلب أو كل الأشياء التي قد تحتاجها من الذكاء الاصطناعي. وبصراحة، كلما مر الوقت أشعر أنني أميل إليه أكثر وأحبه أكثر. وقد صدر له اليوم تحديث جديد، وهو الإصدار الرابع منه، ووفقًا لما قيل، هو الآن أقوى وأذكى ذكاء اصطناعي على وجه الأرض. فحاول أن تجربه، لن تخسر شيئًا.</p>

<p>الأمر الذي يتفوق فيه Grok كثيرًا على ChatGPT، والذي لا يوجد أي ذكاء اصطناعي آخر على مستوى العالم يمكنه منافسته فيه، هو الأخبار والمعلومات الجديدة. لماذا؟ لأن Grok تابع لإيلون ماسك، وإيلون ماسك كان قد اشترى شركة تويتر، أو X حاليًا. ومنصة X معروف أن عليها كل أخبار العالم الجديدة لحظة بلحظة. الأمر غريب، فإيلون ماسك كان من أحد مؤسسي شركة OpenAI التي أنشأت ChatGPT، وهم الآن يتنافسون وقد رفعوا قضايا على بعضهم البعض. يبدو أن أي أمر كبير يحدث في العالم الآن يقف وراءه إيلون ماسك.</p>

<p>المهم، أنا عندما أرغب في معرفة آخر الأخبار في أي مجال، أو آخر الأخبار عمومًا، فإن Grok يساعدني جدًا في هذا الموضوع، ولا أعتقد بصراحة أن هناك أي أداة أخرى يمكنها منافسته في هذا الأمر مهما حدث.</p>

<p>هناك أيضًا ميزة خاصة جدًا، وهي أنه عندما أكون أتصفح منصة X وتصادفني تغريدة لا أفهمها، يمكنني بضغطة زر واحدة أن أنتقل تلقائيًا إلى Grok ليشرح لي هذه التغريدة، ويمكنني أن أكمل معه المحادثة وأجعله يفهمني أكثر وأكثر. بالنسبة لي هذه ميزة قوية جدًا وسهلت عليّ أمورًا كثيرة. أشعر أنني قريبًا سأنتقل بشكل كامل إلى Grok بدلاً من ChatGPT، لأنه قوي جدًا بصراحة.</p>

<h3 id="3-perplexity">3. Perplexity</h3>
<p>الأداة التالية هي Perplexity. حتى الآن، لم أرَ أداة تتفوق عليها في مجال البحث (Research)، أو في الإعداد لمقالات جديدة على سبيل المثال. هي أداة قوية في أمور كثيرة وتشبه ChatGPT، ولكنها تتميز بشدة في أنها تقدم أي معلومة مع مصدرها، لتكون متأكدًا من أن كل معلومة مكتوبة صحيحة، لأن الذكاء الاصطناعي أحيانًا يختلق أمورًا من عنده، وهو ما يسمى في عالم الذكاء الاصطناعي بـ “الهلوسة” (Hallucination). هذه الأداة تقدم لك كل شيء مع مصدره، ويمكنك الدخول إلى المصدر بنفسك لتتأكد من كل معلومة. بالنسبة لي، أستخدم هذه الأداة مع ChatGPT في التجهيز للمقالات، ولكن بصراحة لا أستخدمها في باقي الأمور. هي بالنسبة لي قوية ومميزة في هذه النقطة فقط.</p>

<p>الأداة التالية هي Gemini من شركة جوجل. في الماضي، لم تكن هذه الأداة الأفضل على الإطلاق ولم يكن أحد يفضلها، ولكنهم الآن بدأوا في تطويرها بشكل هائل، ومع الوقت تصبح أفضل وأفضل. خصوصًا الآن، أصبحت جيدة جدًا في البرمجة، بل قوية جدًا. جربتها أيضًا في عدة أمور أخرى ووجدتها أصبحت ممتازة. لكن بصراحة، لا أستخدمها كثيرًا حاليًا لأن الأدوات الأخرى تفي بالغرض معي، كما أنني لا يعجبني تصميم Gemini كثيرًا، لذا أستخدمها بين الحين والآخر.</p>

<p>ولكن، أعتقد مما أراه الآن أن Gemini قريبًا جدًا ستصبح من أقوى نماذج الذكاء الاصطناعي، إن لم تكن الأقوى بالفعل، ومن الممكن جدًا أن تتفوق على الجميع. هذا مجرد توقع، ليس أكثر، لأن جوجل تستثمر بقوة في هذا المجال، فسنرى. نحن نعيش حقًا في أكثر العصور جنونًا في تاريخ البشرية، فكل شيء تعرفه يمكن أن يتغير بين يوم وليلة.</p>

<p>من النقاط القوية في Gemini أيضًا أنه يمكنك دمجه مع أدوات جوجل الأخرى واستخدامه معها، مثل Gmail، وGoogle Docs، وYouTube، وغيرها. هذه ستكون نقطة قوية جدًا لصالح جوجل في المستقبل. فقط لو اهتموا بها قليلاً، فستصل إلى مستوى آخر بالفعل.</p>

<h3 id="ملاحظة-هامة">ملاحظة هامة</h3>
<p>ما أريدك أن تعرفه حتى الآن هو أنه لا توجد أداة منهم كاملة؛ بالنسبة لي، إنهم يكملون بعضهم البعض، وكل أداة منهم مميزة في نقطة معينة أو في شيء معين. لذلك، كل فترة ستسمع أن الذكاء الاصطناعي الفلاني أصبح هو الأقوى، فمن الصعب أن تستقر على أداة واحدة. يجب أن تكون مرنًا في عصر الذكاء الاصطناعي، وأن تتابع المقالات التي ننشرها هنا أولاً بأول لتبقى على اطلاع بكل جديد وتحدد ما هو الأنسب لك.</p>

<h3 id="5-auphonic">5. Auphonic</h3>
<p>الأداة التالية هي Auphonic، والتي أستخدمها بكل اختصار لتحسين جودة الصوت بضغطة زر واحدة بمساعدة الذكاء الاصطناعي. هي أداة مجانية تمنحك ساعتين كل شهر مجانًا لاستخدامها، وهي بصراحة تكفيني ويزيدون عن حاجتي أيضًا كل شهر، ربما لأنني لا أنشئ محتوى باستمرار. ولكن حقًا، إذا كنت تنشئ محتوى، حاول تجربتها، صدقني ستحدث فرقًا كبيرًا معك.</p>

<h3 id="6-cursor">6. Cursor</h3>
<p>الأداة الأخيرة التي أستخدمها في يومي هي Cursor. للأسف، هي الأداة الوحيدة المدفوعة من بينها، ولكنها بصراحة تستحق كل مبلغ يُدفع فيها. كنت قد تحدثت معكم عنها من قبل في مقال سابق عن البرمجة. بشكل عام، فكرة الأداة هي أنها تمكنك من إنشاء أي برنامج، موقع ويب، تطبيق، أو أيًا كان ما تريد إنشاءه، دون كتابة سطر برمجي واحد ودون أن تكون على دراية بأي شيء عن البرمجة. هذه الأداة هي التي أستخدمها لأبدأ أي عمل تجاري أو مشروع جديد وأبرمجه في أقل وقت ممكن. لقد أنشأنا بها أشياء كثيرة، مثل منصتي التعليمية، منصة تنمية، وأشياء أخرى كثيرة تحدثت معكم عنها من قبل وسنعلن عنها قريبًا جدًا.</p>

<h3 id="خاتمة">خاتمة</h3>
<p>كانت هذه هي الأدوات التي أستخدمها بشكل شبه يومي. لا تزال هناك أدوات أخرى كثيرة جدًا، وسأجرب معكم أروع وأقوى هذه الأدوات في المقالات القادمة. هذه الأدوات قد لا تستخدمها كل يوم، ولكنك ستحتاج إلى استخدامها في أوقات وحالات معينة. فاستعدوا للقادم.</p>

<p>أراكم في مقال جديد، مع تحدٍ جديد وتجربة جديدة.</p>

        <div class="p-4 flex-grow overflow-hidden">
          <p class="text-base-content">
            <p>مرحبًا بالجميع، كيف حالكم؟ في هذا المقال، سنتناول أداة جديدة تُدعى “Crush CLI” من شركة JetBrains. في الواقع، هذه الأداة تستخدم العديد من نماذج الذكاء الاصطناعي، منها المدفوع ومنها المجاني. تعمل الأداة بالكامل عبر سطر الأوامر (Terminal) ولكنها تمنحك واجهة جيدة المظهر وملونة وجذابة، وتمكّنك من إنجاز مهام متنوعة. لذا، دعونا نلقي نظرة عليها.</p>

<p>من عادتنا في هذا المنشور أن نستعرض كل ما هو جديد، فقد ينال إعجاب البعض أو لا، ولكن من الضروري أن نمنح فكرة عن الأدوات الجديدة، وهذه الأداة جيدة في الواقع.</p>

<h2 id="كيفية-التثبيت-والاستخدام">كيفية التثبيت والاستخدام</h2>

<h3 id="1-تثبيت-الأداة">1. تثبيت الأداة</h3>
<p>لتثبيت الأداة، يمكنك زيارة صفحتهم الرسمية على GitHub (سأترك لكم الرابط في نهاية المقال). نأخذ أمر التثبيت التالي ونقوم بنسخه:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>npm <span class="nb">install</span> <span class="nt">-g</span> crush-cli
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>بعد ذلك، نتوجه لفتح موجه الأوامر (CMD)، ونقوم بلصق الأمر ثم نضغط على <code class="highlighter-rouge">Enter</code>. سيبدأ الآن تحميل الحزمة، فننتظر بضع ثوانٍ حتى تكتمل العملية.</p>

<h3 id="2-تشغيل-الأداة-واختيار-النموذج">2. تشغيل الأداة واختيار النموذج</h3>
<p>بعد اكتمال التثبيت، نكتب الأمر التالي لتشغيل الأداة:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>crush
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>بمجرد الضغط على <code class="highlighter-rouge">Enter</code>، ستفتح واجهة Crush CLI كما هو موضح. ستظهر لك قائمة بالنماذج التي يمكنك استخدامها، بعضها مدفوع مثل Claude، وبعضها الآخر مجاني. يمكنك استخدام أسهم لوحة المفاتيح للتنقل بين النماذج.</p>

<p>نريد أن نجد نموذجًا مجانيًا وقويًا في نفس الوقت. لنجرب نموذج Cohere، فهو قوي ومجاني. إذا نظرت في القائمة، ستجد <code class="highlighter-rouge">cohere/command-r</code> وهو مجاني. ننتقل إليه باستخدام الأسهم ثم نضغط <code class="highlighter-rouge">Enter</code> للمتابعة.</p>

<h3 id="3-الحصول-على-مفتاح-api">3. الحصول على مفتاح API</h3>
<p>ستطلب منك الأداة إدخال مفتاح API الخاص بنموذج Cohere من خلال موقع OpenRouter. للقيام بذلك، اتبع الخطوات التالية:</p>
<ol>
  <li>اذهب إلى موقع OpenRouter.</li>
  <li>في قسم النماذج (Models)، ابحث عن <code class="highlighter-rouge">Cohere</code>.</li>
  <li>اختر <code class="highlighter-rouge">cohere/command-r</code>.</li>
  <li>انتقل إلى قسم API واضغط على <code class="highlighter-rouge">Create API Key</code>.</li>
  <li>قم بتسمية المفتاح بأي اسم، ثم اضغط <code class="highlighter-rouge">Create</code>.</li>
  <li>انسخ مفتاح API الذي تم إنشاؤه.</li>
</ol>

<p>الآن، نعود إلى سطر الأوامر ونلصق المفتاح (باستخدام <code class="highlighter-rouge">Ctrl+V</code>) ثم نضغط <code class="highlighter-rouge">Enter</code>. ستظهر علامة صح بجانب المفتاح للدلالة على أنه تم التعرف عليه بنجاح. ستسألك الأداة إذا كنت تريد التثبيت الآن، اضغط <code class="highlighter-rouge">Enter</code> للموافقة (Yes).</p>

<p>بعد الانتظار قليلًا، ستظهر رسالة تفيد بأن الأداة جاهزة للعمل.</p>

<h2 id="مثال-عملي-إنشاء-لعبة-كسر-الطوب">مثال عملي: إنشاء لعبة كسر الطوب</h2>

<p>الآن، يمكننا استخدام الأداة كوكيل ذكاء اصطناعي. لنجرب أن نطلب منه إنشاء لعبة كسر الطوب (Brick Breaker)، وهي اللعبة التي تحتوي على مضرب يضرب كرة لكسر مربعات في الأعلى.</p>

<p><strong>ملاحظة:</strong> ستلاحظ في الجانب الأيمن من الواجهة أن النموذج المستخدم هو <code class="highlighter-rouge">cohere/command-r</code> وبجانبه كلمة ‘Free’، مما يشير إلى أن التكلفة هي صفر.</p>

<p>لنكتب له الأمر التالي:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“أنشئ لي لعبة كسر الطوب (Brick Breaker) مع رسوم متحركة احترافية.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>بعد إعطاء الأمر، ستطلب الأداة صلاحية للبدء في إنشاء اللعبة، نضغط <code class="highlighter-rouge">Enter</code> للموافقة. ثم ستسأل “هل يجب أن أبدأ في تنفيذ هذه المهمة؟”، نختار <code class="highlighter-rouge">Yes</code> ونضغط <code class="highlighter-rouge">Enter</code>.</p>

<p>بعد أن ينتهي، يمكننا فتح ملف <code class="highlighter-rouge">index.html</code> الذي تم إنشاؤه لنرى اللعبة. اللعبة بسيطة وتحتوي على زر “Start Game”. كنت قد طلبت منه إضافة رسوم متحركة، وبالفعل، هناك عناصر تسقط من الطوب الذي يتم كسره، مثل العناصر التي تزيد من سرعة الكرة أو تكبر حجم المضرب. لقد صممها بشكل لطيف. بالطبع، تعتمد النتيجة على دقة وجودة الطلب الأولي؛ كان بإمكاننا طلب ميزات إضافية.</p>

<h3 id="التنقل-في-الواجهة">التنقل في الواجهة</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Ctrl + P</strong>: لفتح القائمة الرئيسية التي تتيح لك بدء جلسة جديدة، أو التبديل بين الجلسات، أو تغيير النموذج المستخدم.</li>
  <li><strong>Ctrl + C</strong>: لإيقاف المهمة الحالية.</li>
  <li><strong>Esc</strong>: للخروج من الأداة.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="تنظيم-المشاريع">تنظيم المشاريع</h2>
<p>هناك أمر آخر أردت أن أذكره لكم، وهو كيفية إنشاء مجلد للمشروع لتنظيم الملفات الناتجة.</p>
<ol>
  <li>أنشئ مجلدًا جديدًا في المكان الذي تريده (على سبيل المثال، على سطح المكتب) وقم بتسميته (مثلًا <code class="highlighter-rouge">BricksGame</code>).</li>
  <li>ادخل إلى المجلد الذي أنشأته.</li>
  <li>في شريط العنوان الخاص بمستكشف الملفات، اكتب <code class="highlighter-rouge">cmd</code> واضغط <code class="highlighter-rouge">Enter</code>. سيؤدي هذا إلى فتح موجه الأوامر في مسار المجلد الحالي.</li>
  <li>الآن، إذا كتبت <code class="highlighter-rouge">crush</code> لتشغيل الأداة، فإن أي مشروع أو ملفات تقوم بإنشائها سيتم حفظها مباشرة داخل هذا المجلد.</li>
</ol>

<p>وبهذا، يمكنك الآن أن تطلب منه إنشاء مواقع ويب، تطبيقات، أو أي شيء آخر تريده، وستجد كل شيء منظمًا في مكانه.</p>

<h2 id="رأي-شخصي">رأي شخصي</h2>
<p>إذا أردت رأيي، لأكون صريحًا، لا أرى أنها أداة قوية جدًا. لكنها أداة كان لا بد من إعطائكم فكرة عنها. دوري هو أن أعرّفكم بكل ما هو جديد، فقد يعجبك وقد لا يعجبك. قد لا يفضل البعض استخدام سطر الأوامر، ولكني أقدم لكم الجديد.</p>

<p>بصراحة، لم تعجبني كثيرًا. صحيح أنها مجانية وتتيح الوصول إلى نماذج مجانية، ولكني أرى أن هناك أدوات أخرى يمكنها استخدام هذه النماذج المجانية بشكل أفضل. تجربتي معها لم تكن مبهرة، ولكني أحببت أن أعرّفكم عليها.</p>

<h2 id="خاتمة">خاتمة</h2>
<p>وهذا كل ما لدي اليوم. أتمنى أن يكون هذا المقال قد نال إعجابكم، وأشكركم جزيلًا على القراءة.</p>

            <p>مثلما كانت هناك معركة بين الدبابات والمدفعية والطائرات، كانت هناك أيضًا معركة خفية بين المهندسين. كان الجيش الألماني دائمًا يسبق بخطوة، ليس لأنه كان أذكى، بل لأنه كان يمتلك سلاحًا لا يملكه أي طرف آخر، وهذا السلاح هو “إنجما”.</p>

<p>كان “إنجما” جهازًا يتواصل به الجيش الألماني، ينقلون من خلاله المعلومات والأوامر العسكرية. خطط هجومهم، وأنشطتهم اليومية، ومصير الأسرى، كل شيء يتعلق بالجيش الألماني كان يمر عبر هذا الجهاز. قد يبدو هذا خطيرًا، فلو تمكن أحدهم من الحصول على الجهاز، سيعرف كل تحركات الألمان. في الحقيقة، لم يكن الأمر يمثل أي خطر. كان “إنجما” جهازًا ميكانيكيًا قادرًا على تغيير شفرته كل يوم دون أن يعرف أحد كيف يمكن فكها. وحتى لو تمكن شخص من فك الشفرة، وهو أمر قد يستغرق سنوات أو مليارات السنين، فلن يكون ذلك مهمًا لأن الشفرة تتغير يوميًا.</p>

<p>جهاز قوي بالفعل، لكن هل كانت بريطانيا وأمريكا ستلتزمان الصمت؟ كان عالم الرياضيات والتشفير، آلان تورنج، في سباق مع الزمن لبناء آلة يمكنها فك الشفرة في نفس اليوم قبل أن تتغير. هل نجح في ذلك؟ نعم، لقد نجح. ومن هنا ظهر أول حاسوب إلكتروني قادر على إجراء حسابات بهذا التعقيد في وقت قصير نسبيًا، وبدأ شكل العالم يتغير.</p>

<p>ولكن، هل للأفضل؟ في ظل التطور الهائل للحواسيب الذي نشهده اليوم، مثل نماذج الذكاء الاصطناعي، والروبوتات، والحواسيب فائقة السرعة، هل لا يزال بإمكان الإنسان أن يفعل المزيد، أم أننا وصلنا إلى مرحلة التشبع؟</p>

<h3 id="دوامة-ما-بعد-الثانوية">دوامة ما بعد الثانوية</h3>

<p>عندما تنهي المرحلة الثانوية، تبدأ وجهة نظرك في التغير تمامًا تجاه كل شيء حولك. تنفتح عيناك على أمور لم تكن تفكر فيها من قبل: ما معنى كلية؟ ما هو الـ GPA؟ ما الفرق بين هذه الكلية وتلك؟ وما هي التخصصات؟ وما هو هدف الذين يدخلون الجامعة؟ وماذا يجب أن أفعل الآن؟</p>

<p>تعيش في دوامة من الأسئلة التي لا تنتهي. الفترة بين ظهور النتيجة ودخول الجامعة تحدد الكثير من مستقبلك، لذا يجب أن تختار بشكل صحيح. ولكي تختار بشكل صحيح، يجب أن تعرف بشكل صحيح. لهذا السبب، نحن هنا اليوم لنساعدك على المعرفة، ولنرى ما إذا كانت كلية الحاسبات تستحق كل هذا العناء، أم من الأفضل أن تدخل أي كلية أخرى وتدرس البرمجة بشكل جانبي.</p>

<h3 id="ما-هي-علوم-الحاسب-وهل-البرمجة-هي-كل-شيء">ما هي علوم الحاسب؟ وهل البرمجة هي كل شيء؟</h3>

<p>لنكن صريحين، البرمجة ليست شيئًا يمكن تعلمه بشكل جانبي. ربما هناك مجالان أو ثلاثة يمكنك تعلمهما بجانب دراستك والوصول فيهما إلى مستوى جيد، لكن ليس أكثر من ذلك.</p>

<p>كلية الحاسبات بشكل عام ليست مبنية على البرمجة فقط. نعم، البرمجة ركيزة مهمة جدًا من أساسيات الكلية، لكن الكلية نفسها مبنية على “الحوسبة” وليس “البرمجة”. لهذا السبب اسمها “كلية الحاسبات والمعلومات” وليس “كلية البرمجة والذكاء الاصطناعي”. البرمجة والذكاء الاصطناعي هي مجالات فرعية ضمن الحوسبة.</p>

<p>الحوسبة هي كل مجالات الكمبيوتر، أي علوم الكمبيوتر بأكملها. لكي نفهم هذا، سنجد أن هناك مجالات عمل كثيرة جدًا. سأعرض الآن خمسة من أكبرها من وجهة نظري، وهناك غيرها الكثير.</p>

<h3 id="مجالات-العمل-الرئيسية-في-علوم-الحاسب">مجالات العمل الرئيسية في علوم الحاسب</h3>

<h4 id="١-هندسة-البرمجيات-واختبارها-software-engineering--testing">١. هندسة البرمجيات واختبارها (Software Engineering &amp; Testing)</h4>

<p>هذا هو المجال الذي يعمل فيه معظم خريجي الحاسبات. يعتمد بشكل كبير جدًا على البرمجة. في هذا المجال، نقوم بتطوير البرمجيات، أي نكتب برامج ونطورها ونختبرها لنقدمها بأفضل صورة ممكنة.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>أمثلة:</strong> تطبيق واتساب، موقع التنسيق، المصعد الذي تستخدمه في منزلك (فهو ليس مجرد كهرباء وميكانيكا، بل يحتوي على برمجة)، وألعاب مثل Call of Duty و FIFA. كل هذه الأشياء هي برمجيات.</li>
</ul>

<p>نتيجة لذلك، نجد أن مجال تطوير البرمجيات يحتوي على عدة مسارات، مثل:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>تطوير الويب (Web Development):</strong> مثل موقع التنسيق. وهذا مسار بحد ذاته، وينقسم إلى مسارات فرعية مثل العمل على الواجهة الأمامية (Frontend) أو الاهتمام بكيفية عمل الموقع من الخلف والمنطق البرمجي (Backend).</li>
  <li><strong>تطوير تطبيقات الموبايل (Mobile Development):</strong> هذا أيضًا مجال مختلف تمامًا وبه تخصصات، فهناك من يعمل على Android فقط وهناك من يعمل على iOS فقط.</li>
  <li><strong>تطوير الألعاب (Game Development):</strong> مثل لعبة Call of Duty.</li>
  <li><strong>أنظمة التشغيل (Operating Systems):</strong> مثل Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS. هذه كلها برمجيات مكتوبة.</li>
</ul>

<p>يمكن القول إن حوالي 80% من خريجي الحاسبات (وهذا رقم تقديري) يعملون في هذا الجزء فقط. وكما ذكرت، كل مسار من هذه المسارات يحتوي على ثلاث أو أربع وظائف على الأقل.</p>

<h4 id="٢-تكنولوجيا-المعلومات-والأمن-السيبراني-it--cybersecurity">٢. تكنولوجيا المعلومات والأمن السيبراني (IT &amp; Cybersecurity)</h4>

<p>قد يكون هذا المجال هو الأقل اعتمادًا على البرمجة. لم أقل إنه سهل، بل قلت إنه لا يحتوي على برمجة كثيرة مقارنة بهندسة البرمجيات. لكنه يتطلب دراسة أمور أخرى مثل الشبكات.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>مسار الشبكات (Networking):</strong> يمكنك التخصص في الشبكات والعمل كمهندس شبكات (Network Engineer)، حيث تكون مسؤولاً عن تركيب الخوادم وتشغيلها وإدارتها.</li>
  <li><strong>مسار العمليات (Operations):</strong> يمكنك العمل في مجالات مثل DevOps أو كمدير أنظمة (System Admins). الـ DevOps يربط بين فريق التطوير وفريق العمليات، بينما يكون مدير الأنظمة مسؤولاً عن إعدادات الخوادم.</li>
  <li><strong>الحوسبة السحابية (Cloud Computing):</strong> هذا مجال مستقل بذاته، حيث تتعامل مع الخوادم التي تخزن كميات هائلة من المعلومات.</li>
  <li><strong>الأمن السيبراني (Cybersecurity):</strong> مجال مختلف يتطلب دراسة الشبكات وأمور أخرى قريبة من مهندس الشبكات ومدير الأنظمة. يمكنك التخصص فيه بشكل أعمق، حيث يحتوي على جوانب هجومية ودفاعية وهو عالم كبير.</li>
</ul>

<p>كل تخصص من هذه التخصصات يحتوي على ثلاث أو أربع مجالات فرعية، وكل مجال فرعي به وظائف متعددة.</p>

<h4 id="٣-علم-البيانات-والذكاء-الاصطناعي-data-science--ai">٣. علم البيانات والذكاء الاصطناعي (Data Science &amp; AI)</h4>

<p>هنا نعود إلى البرمجة. هذا المجال يتطلب برمجة، ولكنه يحتاج أيضًا إلى رياضيات وإحصاء وقدرة تحليلية عالية.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>الذكاء الاصطناعي (AI):</strong> في هذا المجال، تكتب برمجيات لا تنتج بالضرورة تطبيقًا يتعامل معه المستخدم مباشرة، بل تنتج “نموذجًا” (Model). هذا النموذج يكون له مهمة محددة يقوم بها. الكثير من الأشياء التي نتعامل معها يوميًا تعتمد على تعلم الآلة والذكاء الاصطناعي دون أن نعرف. هذا المجال قديم وموجود منذ التسعينيات، لكنه لم ينمُ بهذا الشكل الهائل إلا بعد ظهور ChatGPT و Gemini. يحتوي هذا المجال على عدد هائل من الوظائف.</li>
  <li><strong>علم البيانات (Data Science):</strong> مجال قريب من الذكاء الاصطناعي في البداية، لكنه يتخصص لاحقًا في علوم البيانات، أي كيفية تنظيم البيانات والاستفادة منها لجعلها مفيدة. علم البيانات وحده يحتوي على عدد كبير جدًا من الوظائف.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="٤-البحث-والتطوير-والحوسبة-النظرية-rd--theoretical-computing">٤. البحث والتطوير والحوسبة النظرية (R&amp;D &amp; Theoretical Computing)</h4>

<p>البحث والتطوير (R&amp;D) ليس مجالاً بحد ذاته، بل هو مصطلح. معظم الهيئات والشركات لديها قسم للبحث والتطوير. العاملون في هذا القسم لا ينتجون منتجًا نهائيًا أو يقومون بوظيفة روتينية، بل يعملون على تطوير أشياء جديدة غير موجودة.</p>
<ul>
  <li>قد يعملون على تطوير الحواسيب نفسها.</li>
  <li>قد يعملون على تطوير الذكاء الاصطناعي.</li>
  <li>قد يعملون على تطوير الشبكات وابتكار طرق جديدة تعمل بها الشبكات حول العالم.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>الحوسبة النظرية (Theoretical Computing):</strong> هو مجال أكاديمي يعتمد على الجانب النظري للحوسبة. لا تنتج فيه شيئًا ملموسًا، بل تبتكر طرقًا جديدة للحوسبة.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>مثال:</strong> الحوسبة الكمومية (Quantum Computing) تعتبر حاليًا ضمن مسارات البحث والتطوير والحوسبة النظرية، لأننا لم نصل بعد إلى مرحلة تكون فيها تكنولوجيا متاحة للجميع.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="٥-أنظمة-الحاسوب-وهندسته-computer-systems--architecture">٥. أنظمة الحاسوب وهندسته (Computer Systems &amp; Architecture)</h4>

<p>هؤلاء يعملون على نظام الكمبيوتر نفسه، كيفية تطويره أو تغيير بنيته (Architecture).</p>
<ul>
  <li>قد يعملون على برمجة الأنظمة المدمجة، مثل المصاعد والسيارات الحديثة التي تركن أو تقود نفسها.</li>
  <li>يعملون أيضًا على العتاد (Hardware) نفسه من الداخل.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>ملاحظة:</strong> كل مجال من هذه المجالات الخمسة هو عالم كبير بحد ذاته. على سبيل المثال، هندسة البرمجيات فقاعة ضخمة، واختبار البرمجيات فقاعة ضخمة أخرى. وكذلك الحال مع تكنولوجيا المعلومات والأمن السيبراني، وعلم البيانات والذكاء الاصطناعي، وهكذا.</p>

<p>ستجد أن المسارات تتداخل في البداية. فمن يبدأ في تكنولوجيا المعلومات أو الأمن السيبراني، لا بد أن يمر على دراسة الشبكات. ومن يبدأ في علم البيانات أو الذكاء الاصطناعي، لا بد أن يمر على الإحصاء ولغة البرمجة بايثون. البداية واحدة، ثم تجد نفسك عند مفترق طرق.</p>

<h3 id="هل-يجب-أن-أتخصص-من-البداية">هل يجب أن أتخصص من البداية؟</h3>

<p>ستشعر بعبء لأن مجالات الكلية كثيرة جدًا. قد تخاف وتقرر أن تحدد مجالًا واحدًا فقط وتدرسه من السنة الأولى إلى الأخيرة. لكن افترض أنك درست تكنولوجيا المعلومات وتخرجت ولم تجد وظيفة، هل ستعود لدراسة علم البيانات من الصفر لمدة سنتين أو أربع سنوات أخرى؟ هذا ليس منطقيًا.</p>

<p>الصواب هو أن تدرس الأساسيات أولاً. في أول سنتين، كلنا ندرس نفس الأشياء: رياضيات، برمجة، هياكل بيانات وخوارزميات، وحل المشكلات. لا تقلق إذا كانت هذه المسميات غير مألوفة لك، فسيتم شرحها لاحقًا.</p>

<p>بعد أول سنتين، سيكون لديك أساس قوي في معظم المجالات. إذا أردت التخصص في تكنولوجيا المعلومات، يمكنك ذلك. وإذا لم تجد فرصة عمل، يمكنك التحول إلى تخصص آخر بسهولة لأنك ستكون قد قطعت نصف الطريق بالفعل بفضل الأساسيات التي درستها.</p>

<p>هدفك في أول سنتين هو أن تكون قادرًا على دخول أي مسار دون صعوبة، وإذا لم يعجبك، يمكنك العودة وتجربة مسار آخر. جرب! شاهد دورة تدريبية قصيرة عن تطوير المواقع لمدة يومين أو ثلاثة، وستعرف ما يشعر به مطورو المواقع. هل هذا يعجبك أم لا؟</p>

<h3 id="ماذا-عن-الرياضيات">ماذا عن الرياضيات؟</h3>

<p>أنا طالب من شعبة العلوم، هل أحتاج إلى الرياضيات؟
كما ذكرت، هناك مجالات لا تحتاج إلى رياضيات بكثرة، ومجالات أخرى تعتمد عليها بشكل كبير مثل الذكاء الاصطناعي وعلم البيانات. لكن معظم المجالات الأخرى تحتوي على رياضيات قليلة لن تحتاجها إلا نادرًا.</p>

<p>وحتى لو كنت من شعبة العلوم وتريد التخصص في الذكاء الاصطناعي، هل الرياضيات عائق؟ لا. في السنة الأولى، ستدرس تقريبًا نفس الرياضيات التي درسها زملاؤك في شعبة الرياضيات. الرياضيات لن تكون صعبة، كل ما تحتاجه هو المذاكرة بجد.</p>

<p>وإذا كنت لا تحب الرياضيات، فربما لم يشرحها لك أحد بشكل صحيح. ابحث على يوتيوب عن “رياضيات حاسبات ومعلومات” وستجد كمية هائلة من الدورات المجانية.</p>

<p><strong>ملاحظة للطلاب من شعبة العلوم:</strong> لا تخف من أن يسبقك طلاب شعبة الرياضيات. في كثير من الأحيان، يدخل طالب الرياضيات الكلية وهو يشعر بأنه يعرف كل شيء لأنه درسه من قبل، فيبدأ في الاسترخاء وعدم المذاكرة. وفي نهاية العام، يجد أن طالب العلوم قد تفوق عليه لأنه كان مجتهدًا. بعد السنة الأولى، تتساوى الرؤوس، فكلكم ستكونون قد درستم نفس الأساسيات.</p>

<h3 id="حاسبات-أم-هندسة">حاسبات أم هندسة؟</h3>

<p>نحن لا نقول إن إحدى الكليتين أفضل من الأخرى، بل نقارن بشكل موضوعي بينهما.</p>

<p><strong>الدراسة:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>هندسة (قسم حاسبات):</strong> تدرس برمجيات (Software) وعتاد (Hardware) بشكل متساوٍ تقريبًا.</li>
  <li><strong>حاسبات:</strong> تركز بشكل أكبر على البرمجيات، مع دراسة للعتاد ولكن بشكل أقل تعمقًا.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>عيوب هندسة (قسم حاسبات):</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>التنسيق:</strong> تنسيق قسم الحاسبات في كليات الهندسة مرتفع جدًا بسبب الإقبال الشديد عليه، مما يجعل دخوله صعبًا ومحفوفًا بالمخاطر.</li>
  <li><strong>سنة الإعدادي:</strong> تضيع سنة كاملة في دراسة مواد لا علاقة لها بالحاسوب مثل الميكانيكا والرسم الهندسي.</li>
  <li><strong>المجتمع:</strong> مجتمع كلية الحاسبات أكثر تركيزًا وتخصصًا، فكل الطلاب يهدفون إلى نفس المجال، مما يخلق بيئة تنافسية وتعاونية أفضل.</li>
  <li><strong>الأنشطة الطلابية:</strong> الأنشطة الطلابية المتعلقة بالحاسوب تكون أكثر كثافة في كلية الحاسبات.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>مميزات هندسة (قسم حاسبات):</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>عمق الدراسة:</strong> الدراسة في الهندسة أثقل والمواد أكثر، مما يعني أنك تتخرج بحصيلة علمية أكبر، خاصة في جانب العتاد.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>عيوب حاسبات:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>النقابة:</strong> لا توجد نقابة رسمية لخريجي الحاسبات حتى الآن، ولكن هناك منظمات مثل IEEE تعترف بالخريجين وتقدم لهم فرصًا.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="هل-يمكنني-دراسة-البرمجة-بشكل-مستقل">هل يمكنني دراسة البرمجة بشكل مستقل؟</h3>

<p>نعم، يمكنك ذلك، وهناك من ينجح في هذا. لكن كلية الحاسبات تؤهلك أكاديميًا وتمنحك فهمًا عميقًا لكيفية عمل الكمبيوتر من الداخل، وهو ما يصعب الحصول عليه من الدورات التدريبية وحدها. وجود خريج حاسبات في مقابلة عمل قد يعطيه الأفضلية عليك، إلا إذا بذلت مجهودًا مضاعفًا وجمعت بين مذاكرة كليتك ودراسة الحاسبات بشكل مكثف، وهو أمر صعب جدًا.</p>

<h3 id="ماذا-عن-برامج-الساعات-المعتمدة-credit-hours">ماذا عن برامج الساعات المعتمدة (Credit Hours)؟</h3>

<p>برامج الساعات المعتمدة تقدم تخصصات قد لا تكون موجودة في البرامج العادية، ويكون عدد الطلاب أقل، مما يوفر بيئة تعليمية أفضل للبعض. بعض الجامعات تمنح شهادة مزدوجة. لكن من حيث المحتوى العلمي، خاصة في أول سنتين، فالفروقات ليست كبيرة لدرجة تبرر المبالغ الطائلة التي يتم دفعها.</p>

<h3 id="حقيقة-سوق-العمل">حقيقة سوق العمل</h3>

<p>فكرة أن خريج الحاسبات تتهافت عليه الشركات ويتقاضى آلاف الدولارات فور تخرجه هي فكرة غير حقيقية. مثل أي مجال آخر، إذا تميزت فيه، ستحصل على رواتب مرتفعة. وإذا لم تتميز، ستحصل على راتب عادي. فرص العمل في هذا المجال أفضل من غيره، لكن الوصول إلى المستويات العليا يتطلب عملًا دؤوبًا وتطويرًا مستمرًا للذات.</p>

<h3 id="طبيعة-المواد-الدراسية">طبيعة المواد الدراسية</h3>

<p>تنقسم المواد في كلية الحاسبات إلى أربعة أقسام:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>البرمجة (Software):</strong> هذا هو الجزء الأهم والأساسي.</li>
  <li><strong>العتاد (Hardware):</strong> لفهم كيفية عمل الآلة التي نبرمجها.</li>
  <li><strong>الرياضيات والإحصاء:</strong> تخدم على البرمجة والذكاء الاصطناعي.</li>
  <li><strong>المواد النظرية:</strong> لتنمية المهارات غير التقنية، مثل إدارة الأعمال.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="هل-الدراسة-في-الكلية-كافية">هل الدراسة في الكلية كافية؟</h3>

<p>بصراحة، لا. مواد الكلية وحدها لن تؤهلك لسوق العمل، تمامًا كما أن الدورات التدريبية وحدها لن تفعل ذلك. تحتاج إلى التوفيق بين الاثنين: التركيز على مواد الكلية للحصول على أساس علمي قوي وشهادة بتقدير جيد، والتركيز على الدورات التدريبية لتعلم أحدث التقنيات والأدوات وبناء المشاريع. هذا هو مصدر الضغط الحقيقي في كلية الحاسبات.</p>

<h3 id="ماذا-لو-لم-أتمكن-من-الالتحاق-بكلية-الحاسبات">ماذا لو لم أتمكن من الالتحاق بكلية الحاسبات؟</h3>

<p>لديك بدائل كثيرة:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>الجامعات الخاصة:</strong> قوية لكنها باهظة الثمن.</li>
  <li><strong>كلية العلوم (قسم حاسب):</strong> بديل ممتاز جدًا وتدرس مواد شبيهة جدًا بكلية الحاسبات.</li>
  <li><strong>المعاهد التكنولوجية:</strong> هناك معاهد كثيرة جيدة.</li>
</ul>

<p>في كل الأحوال، ستحتاج إلى أخذ دورات تدريبية. الفرق يكمن في أن شهادتك سيكون مكتوبًا فيها “حاسبات ومعلومات”، وهو ما قد يمثل ميزة.</p>

<h3 id="التعلم-الذاتي-والأنشطة-الطلابية">التعلم الذاتي والأنشطة الطلابية</h3>

<p><strong>التعلم الذاتي (Self-Learning):</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>اقرأ كثيرًا على فيسبوك، والمواقع المتخصصة، والمدونات.</li>
  <li>ابحث على يوتيوب عن تقييمات الدورات التدريبية.</li>
  <li>اسأل الطلاب الأكبر منك سنًا عن خبراتهم.</li>
  <li>التزم واستمر.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>الأنشطة الطلابية (Student Activities):</strong>
لا تضيع وقتك! في سنتك الأولى، أنت بحاجة ماسة إلى المهارات الناعمة (Soft Skills).</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>العلاقات العامة (Public Relations - PR):</strong> انضم إلى هذا النشاط أولاً. سيعلمك مهارات التواصل، والعرض، والتسويق لنفسك.</li>
  <li><strong>الموارد البشرية (Human Resources - HR):</strong> يعلمك كيفية كتابة سيرة ذاتية قوية، وقوة الملاحظة، والتعامل مع الناس.</li>
  <li><strong>لا تتسرع في الأنشطة التقنية:</strong> لا تدخل في أنشطة مثل (Backend) أو (Frontend) في الفصل الدراسي الأول. أنت بحاجة إلى بناء أساس قوي أولاً. الدخول في التكنولوجيا المتقدمة بدون أساسيات يشبه بناء عمارة على الهواء.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="أهمية-الأساسيات-وحل-المشكلات">أهمية الأساسيات وحل المشكلات</h3>

<p><strong>الأساسيات (Basics):</strong>
هي أساسيات البرمجة. تعلم لغة برمجة واحدة وافهم مفاهيمها الأساسية جيدًا. هذه المفاهيم (Concepts) موجودة في كل لغات البرمجة تقريبًا. إذا أتقنتها، يمكنك تعلم أي تكنولوجيا جديدة بسهولة.</p>

<p><strong>حل المشكلات (Problem Solving):</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>يعلمك كيفية التعامل مع المشاكل وتقسيم المشكلة الكبيرة إلى مشاكل أصغر.</li>
  <li>يقوي إرادتك وعزيمتك ويجعلك لا تستسلم بسهولة.</li>
  <li>يطور تفكيرك المنطقي، وهو أمر حيوي لأي مبرمج.</li>
  <li>أساسي لاجتياز المقابلات التقنية في الشركات.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="نصائح-أخيرة">نصائح أخيرة</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>العلاقات والبيئة الجامعية:</strong> ابحث بجد عن صحبة صالحة تدفعك للأمام وتساعدك على التعلم. لا تقضِ سنوات الجامعة وحيدًا، ولا تضيع وقتك مع صحبة سيئة تشدك للخلف.</li>
  <li><strong>التطوير الذاتي:</strong> سنوات الكلية هي أثمن سنوات حياتك. استثمرها في تكوين العلاقات، وتعلم المهارات، وحضور الفعاليات، واكتساب الخبرات. تعلم من أخطاء غيرك وكن مبدعًا في أخطائك.</li>
  <li><strong>اتخاذ القرار:</strong> الفترة الحالية صعبة ومليئة بالحيرة. فكر مع نفسك، ابتعد عن وسائل التواصل الاجتماعي قليلاً، واستمع لأصحاب الخبرة. أنت أعرف الناس بنفسك.</li>
  <li><strong>التوازن:</strong> لا تهمل أهلك وأصدقاءك بسبب الدراسة. وقت الجامعة هو أفضل وقت لصنع الذكريات، وأفضل وقت للتعلم، وأفضل وقت لاكتساب الخبرة. حاول أن تجمع كل شيء.</li>
</ul>

<p>أخيرًا، الكلية التي ستلتحق بها هي الخيار الأفضل لك. كن متفائلاً بأنك مقبل على أيام جيدة، قد تكون مليئة بالتعب والجهد، لكنها ستكون مثمرة.</p>

            <p>أنت تشاهد الشروحات التعليمية ليلاً ونهاراً، وتتابع كل قنوات البرمجة، وقد أنشأت تطبيق قائمة مهام وخمسة تطبيقات أخرى مشابهة، ومع ذلك، تشعر أيضاً أنك لا تزال مبتدئاً. عندما تجلس مع نفسك وتقرر أنك تريد كتابة رمز برمجي فعلي، لا تعرف من أين تبدأ. وعندما يواجهك عطب برمجي أو خطأ، تقوم بأخذه كما هو، دون حتى أن تقرأه، وتلقي به على ChatGPT أو Stack Overflow دون أن تفهم أصل المشكلة. أنت هنا تتعلم، لكنك لا تتطور.</p>

<p>إذا شعرت أن هذا الكلام يخصك وترغب في معرفة حل هذه المشكلة، فهذا ما سنتعرف عليه في هذا المقال. لا تقلق، أنت لست وحدك، وبعد أن تنهي قراءة هذا المقال، ستكون قد عرفت الحل وستكون لديك خطوات عملية يمكنك تطبيقها بدءاً من اليوم. دعنا نرى معًا الآن ما هو أصل المشكلة.</p>

<h3 id="التعلم-لا-يعني-التقدم-الحقيقي">التعلم لا يعني التقدم الحقيقي</h3>
<p>يعتقد الكثير من الناس أن مجرد مشاهدة شيء ما يعني أنك تعلمته. مشاهدتك لشروحات بايثون لا تعني أنك تعلمت بايثون. أخذك لرمز برمجي من GitHub ووضعه في مشروعك لا يعني أيضاً أنك تفهم ماذا يفعل وما الذي يحدث خلفه. إذا أنهيت تحدي برمجة لمدة 100 يوم، فهذا لا يعني أيضاً أنك أصبحت مبرمجاً.</p>

<p>تمامًا مثلما تشاهد مباراة كرة قدم كل يوم، هذا لا يعني أنك عندما تنزل إلى الملعب ستعرف كيف تلعب الكرة. الفكرة نفسها هنا: أن تشاهد الرمز البرمجي ليس مثل أن تكتبه بيدك على الإطلاق.</p>

<h3 id="رحلة-علي-ومحمد-قصة-متعلمين">رحلة علي ومحمد: قصة متعلمين</h3>
<p>دعنا الآن نرى رحلة علي ومحمد التي استمرت لمدة ستة أشهر في تعلمهما للبرمجة، ونرى إلى أين وصل كل واحد منهما.</p>

<h4 id="رحلة-علي">رحلة علي</h4>
<p>كان علي يشاهد يومياً شروحات خاصة بالبرمجة ويحل بعض المسائل من وقت لآخر كنوع من حل المشكلات. وكان يفعل شيئًا مثيرًا للاهتمام، حيث يبدأ في تعلم JavaScript ثم لا يكملها، فينتقل إلى C++ ولا يكملها، ثم ينتقل إلى Python ولا يكملها. يبدأ في أخذ معلومات بسيطة جداً من كل لغة. بعد قليل يجد أن الذكاء الاصطناعي أصبح رائجاً فيقرر: “خلاص، سأتعلم الذكاء الاصطناعي”. ومرة يقول: “لا، سأتعلم الأمن السيبراني”، ومرة أخرى: “لا، سأتعلم تطوير الويب”. وعندما يقرر أخيراً أن ينشئ مشروعاً بناءً على ما تعلمه، فإنه يقوم بنفس المشاريع التي أنشأها في البداية.</p>

<p>علي يخاف جدًا من الأخطاء والأعطاب البرمجية. حرفيًا، عندما يواجه خطأ في البرنامج الذي يعمل عليه، يغمض عينيه، يمسك الخطأ ويلقيه على ChatGPT، ثم يغمض عينيه مرة أخرى ويأخذ الحل ويلقيه في برنامجه ويضغط على زر التشغيل. إذا عمل البرنامج، يكون الأمر ممتازاً. إذا لم يعمل، يكرر نفس العملية.</p>

<p>بعد ستة أشهر، يقول علي: “أنا نسيت أساسيات في البرمجة ولا أستطيع تحديد ما تعلمته، كما أنني لا أعرف كيف أبدأ في مشاريع، وإذا بدأت، فإنني أبدأ في مشاريع بسيطة جداً لا تفعل أي شيء يذكر”.</p>

<h4 id="رحلة-محمد">رحلة محمد</h4>
<p>قرر محمد أن يتبع نهجاً مختلفاً. لقد اختار لغة برمجة معينة وبدأ يركز عليها فقط. بعد أن تعلم قليلاً، فكر محمد مع نفسه وقال: “ما الذي أحتاجه لمساعدتي في هذه الفترة؟ أريد أن أعرف كم أنفق كل يوم”، وقرر إنشاء تطبيق يعرض له إحصائيات عن نفقاته الأسبوعية، نصف الشهرية، والشهرية.</p>

<p>لكن بدلاً من تحميل تطبيق جاهز أو استخدام برنامج صنعه شخص آخر، قال: “لا، أنا من سيصنع هذا البرنامج”. بدأ فعلاً في العمل على البرنامج. كانت هناك أعطاب برمجية وأخطاء كثيرة جداً، وحرفياً لم يكن يعرف من أين يبدأ. لكن كانت لديه الفكرة، الرغبة في أن يصنع شيئاً لنفسه يساعده هو.</p>

<p>على الرغم من أن الموضوع كان صعباً، تعلم محمد من هذه التجربة أشياء كثيرة جداً، وبدأ يشعر بالفخر بنفسه. وفعلاً، استطاع أن يمسك شيئاً ملموساً في يده ويقول: “أنا صنعت هذا الشيء”. لا يقول لصديقه مثلاً: “لقد تعلمت لغة C++ أو Python”، بل يقول له: “لقد صنعت هذا التطبيق، أو هذا الموقع، أو هذا البرنامج”.</p>

<p>المميز أيضاً أن محمد بدأ يكتب تعليقات (comments) على الرموز البرمجية التي يكتبها لكي يتذكرها، وليشرحها لنفسه. وعندما يواجه أخطاء معينة، لا يسارع إلى جوجل أو ChatGPT فوراً لحلها، بل يحاول أن يفكر فيها أولاً. وبعد ذلك، إذا لم يصل إلى حل، يبدأ في البحث.</p>

<p>وهناك شيء جيد آخر يفعله محمد، قد يكون صعباً في البداية لأنه يحتاج إلى عادة، وهو أنه يكتب كل أسبوع ما تعلمه، وما هي الأخطاء التي واجهته، وكيف يمكنه تطوير نفسه في هذا المجال.</p>

<p>بعد نفس الستة أشهر، أصبح لدى محمد مناعة من البرمجة ومناعة من الأخطاء، وأصبح لديه ثقة في نفسه تمكنه من الدخول في مشاريع أخرى، وهذه المشاريع بالطبع ستكون أكبر من التي أنشأها. كما أنه يقول شيئاً مهماً: “اختر مشروعاً لا تعرف كيف تنجزه، وابدأ فيه. لا تتبع الشروحات التعليمية بشكل أعمى”.</p>

<p>كلاهما قضى نفس الوقت في التعلم. محمد أصبح لديه ثقة في نفسه في البرمجة وبدأ فعلاً في إنشاء مشاريع حقيقية، بينما علي لا يزال يتساءل: هل JavaScript أفضل أم لغة C++؟</p>

<h3 id="تلخيص-المشاكل-والحلول-العملية">تلخيص المشاكل والحلول العملية</h3>
<p>دعنا نلخص هذه المشاكل ونقدم خطوات عملية يمكننا البدء فيها من اليوم. لا تقلق، الأمر بسيط حقًا، وإذا بدأت من اليوم، سيحدث فارقًا كبيرًا معك.</p>

<h4 id="1-المشاهدة-السلبية-مقابل-التطبيق-الفعال">1. المشاهدة السلبية مقابل التطبيق الفعال</h4>
<p>كثير من الناس يشاهدون الشروحات التعليمية كأنهم يشاهدون فيلماً. يتابعون خطوة بخطوة، لكن دون أن يسألوا أنفسهم: “لماذا؟ ماذا سيحدث هنا لو غيرت هذا الرمز؟ لماذا كُتب هذا الجزء هكذا؟”. إنهم لا يطبقون بأيديهم.</p>

<p><strong>الحل:</strong> حوّل أي شرح تعليمي تشاهده إلى تحدٍ. كيف؟ إذا تقدمت جزءاً جيداً في الدورة التعليمية التي تتابعها وانتقلت إلى المقطع التالي، حاول ألا تشاهده كاملاً. شاهد أول دقيقتين فقط لتفهم ما يريد المحاضر أن يشرحه، ثم أوقف الشرح وحاول تنفيذ الفكرة بنفسك. نفذ الشيء الذي يريد هو أن يفعله، ولكن بجهدك الخاص دون مشاهدة الشرح. بنسبة كبيرة قد لا تنجح، ولكن على الأقل تكون قد حاولت. وعندما تعود لمتابعة الشرح، ستكون مركزاً بالفعل على “أين أخطأت؟” و”أريد أن أفهم كيف تم تنفيذ هذا الجزء”.</p>

<p>إذا لم ينجح معك هذا الأسلوب وكان الشرح طويلاً، لنفترض 20 دقيقة، سيكون من الصعب على عقلك أن يطبق على العشرين دقيقة كاملة. حاول أن توقف الشرح كل خمس دقائق وتطبق ما شاهدته. هنا أنت تخدع عقلك حرفياً؛ فبدلاً من التطبيق على 20 دقيقة (وهي مدة طويلة)، وحتى تصل إلى الدقيقة 20 ستكون قد نسيت ما قيل في الدقيقة الخامسة أو الثالثة، وستضطر إلى إعادة مشاهدة الشرح من البداية. حاول تقسيم الشرح إلى أجزاء صغيرة وتطبيقها. هذا الأمر مهم جداً وسيحدث فارقاً كبيراً معك، وسيشعرك بالإنجاز والرضا عن الوقت الذي قضيته في التطبيق.</p>

<h4 id="2-الخوف-من-الأخطاء">2. الخوف من الأخطاء</h4>
<p>أنت لا تخاف من الأخطاء لأن لونها أحمر، بل تخاف منها لأنك ترى “حقيقة نفسك” كما توهمك الأفكار السلبية بذلك، فتقول لك: “انظر، مستواك ليس جيداً، أنت مليء بالأخطاء وكل رموزك البرمجية خاطئة، فاترك هذه البرمجة كلها”. مع أن الأمر الذي يجب أن تكون على يقين منه في البرمجة هو أنها مليئة بالأخطاء. لا يوجد شخص في مجال البرمجة لا يخطئ. أنت تقضي معظم وقتك في حل المشكلات، والبرمجة بحد ذاتها تعريفها هو حل المشكلات. والمشكلة ما هي إلا مجموعة من الأخطاء، وأنت تحل هذه الأخطاء.</p>

<p>حاول فقط قدر الإمكان أن تفكر في الخطأ أو تقرأه قبل أن ترسله إلى ChatGPT، لأن هذا الخطأ قد يبدأ في الظهور معك بشكل متكرر، وفي كل مرة ستشعر وكأنك تراه لأول مرة، لأنك فعلاً لا تقرأه. أنت تلقيه على ChatGPT، تأخذ الحل نسخاً وتلصقه في برنامجك، فيعمل البرنامج. لا تخف من الأخطاء؛ فكل يوم تظهر لك أخطاء، أنت تتعلم حقًا.</p>

<h4 id="3-متلازمة-الشيء-اللامع">3. متلازمة الشيء اللامع</h4>
<p>تقضي أسبوعاً في تعلم HTML، ثم أسبوعاً في Python، ثم أسبوعاً في C++، وتظل تتنقل بين كل مسار والآخر. بالطبع هذا الأمر خاطئ جداً، وهو ما يسمى بـ “متلازمة الشيء اللامع”، حيث أن أي شيء يلمع في عينيك تبدأ بالتوجه إليه لتعلمه.</p>

<p><strong>الحل:</strong> ركز على مسار تقني (stack) أو مجال واحد فقط. ابدأ في تعلمه وأنشئ عليه مشروعاً واثنين وثلاثة. إذا أردت بعد ذلك أن تقوم بالتبديل إلى مجال آخر تريد تعلمه، فالأمر ممكن. لكنك في كل مرة تبدأ في شيء جديد، فإنك تقوم بإعادة الضبط وتبدأ من الصفر. على سبيل المثال، تكون قد وصلت إلى مستوى معين، ثم إذا قررت البدء في شيء جديد، فإنك تعود إلى نقطة البداية لتصل إلى مستوى معين آخر، وبدلاً من أن تكمل لتستمر وتتعمق، قد تعود مرة أخرى للبداية مع شيء جديد آخر. حاول قدر الإمكان أن تنجز مشاريع قبل الانتقال إلى شيء جديد تريد تعلمه.</p>

<h4 id="4-الشروحات-مقابل-المشاريع-الحقيقية">4. الشروحات مقابل المشاريع الحقيقية</h4>
<p>الشروحات التعليمية تمنحك خطوات منظمة ومرتبة، وهذا شيء جيد جداً. لكن المشروع الحقيقي يضع أمامك خطوات غير مرتبة ويعرض لك مشكلات واقعية، ومن المفترض أن تأخذ كل ذلك وتبدأ في التعامل معه. هذا هو الشيء الذي سيعلمك حقًا.</p>

<p>إذا أردت أن تتحمس في عمل المشاريع، فانظر إلى ما تحتاجه وابدأ في صنعه. لا تقل: “أحتاج أن أصنع لعبة معينة وأنشرها على متجر التطبيقات لتحقق نجاحاً عالمياً”. حاول قدر الإمكان أن تبدأ ببساطة، بأشياء تحتاجها في حياتك الشخصية أو الاجتماعية.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>مثال ١:</strong> هل تتناول فيتامينات كل يوم؟ اصنع تطبيقاً ينظم لك مواعيد تناولها، ويحدد الأيام والساعات، وينشئ إشعاراً يظهر لك في الوقت المناسب.</li>
  <li><strong>مثال ٢:</strong> هل تريد تتبع نفقاتك؟ اصنع تطبيقاً لهذا الغرض.
كلما أردت أن تصنع شيئاً لنفسك، ستتحمس لإكمال هذه المشاريع.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="خلاصة-طريقة-التعلم-الفعالة">خلاصة طريقة التعلم الفعالة</h3>
<p>والآن، إليك طريقة من خمس خطوات تلخص كل ما ذكرناه وتعلمك كيفية اكتساب أي مهارة جديدة:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>تعلم:</strong> شاهد شرحًا أو اقرأ مقالات في المجال الجديد الذي ترغب في تعلمه.</li>
  <li><strong>جرب:</strong> اكتب أمثلة بنفسك من الصفر.</li>
  <li><strong>أفسد:</strong> حاول إفساد الرمز البرمجي الذي كتبته عمدًا بيدك.</li>
  <li><strong>أصلح:</strong> ابدأ في إصلاح ما أفسدته.</li>
  <li><strong>اشرح:</strong> إما أن تشرح الأمر لنفسك، أو إذا كانت لديك القدرة، اشرحه لشخص آخر. فهذا هو ما سيعمق فهمك حقًا.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>تعلم، جرب، أفسد، أصلح، اشرح.</strong></p>

<p>هذه خمس خطوات إذا طبقتها فعلاً، فستحدث فارقاً كبيراً معك.</p>

            <p>أي شخص في العالم العربي حاليًا، أو في أي مكان في هذا العالم، يعرف أن الذكاء الاصطناعي هو المستقبل. قد تكون أضعت فرصة البيتكوين، أو الدروب شيبينج، أو التداول، أو كل الفرص التي ظهرت سابقًا. لكننا سنرى معًا خطوة بخطوة لماذا يعتبر الذكاء الاصطناعي هو التجربة الذهبية التالية والفرصة الذهبية الكبرى.</p>

<p>في هذا المقال، سنتناول مفهوم الذكاء الاصطناعي، والفرصة الضخمة الموجودة في هذا المجال، وما يمكنك تحقيقه إذا انخرطت فيه الآن أو خلال الخمسة أشهر القادمة. سنرى أيضًا خطوات كيفية البدء باختصار.</p>

<h3 id="ما-هي-وكالة-الذكاء-الاصطناعي">ما هي وكالة الذكاء الاصطناعي؟</h3>

<p>هناك نوعان رئيسيان من الوكالات التي يمكنك إنشاؤها:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>وكالة أتمتة الذكاء الاصطناعي (AI Automation Agency):</strong> بكل بساطة، هي أن تذهب إلى شركة لديها عملية كبيرة ومكررة، وتقوم أنت بتحويلها إلى عملية مؤتمتة، إما بنسبة 100% أو بنسبة كبيرة، بحيث تحتاج فقط إلى تحديث أو دعم يدوي من وقت لآخر.</li>
  <li><strong>وكالة الذكاء الاصطناعي (AI Agency):</strong> هي أن تقدم خدمات متنوعة باستخدام الذكاء الاصطناعي بشكل عام، مثل إنشاء مقاطع الفيديو، أو الإعلانات، أو تصميم الشعارات، وغيرها.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="لماذا-الآن-هو-أفضل-وقت-للبدء">لماذا الآن هو أفضل وقت للبدء؟</h3>

<ol>
  <li><strong>السوق لا يزال فارغًا:</strong> المجال، وخصوصًا في العالم العربي، لا يزال فارغًا حقًا. معظم الشركات ما زالت تعتقد أن الذكاء الاصطناعي يقتصر على “شات جي بي تي” وليس لديهم خلفية تقنية كافية لفهم إمكانياته الحقيقية. هذه هي فرصتك لاستغلال معرفتك ومهاراتك وتحويل عملياتهم اليدوية إلى عمليات مؤتمتة.</li>
  <li><strong>الأدوات أصبحت سهلة:</strong> في الماضي، كان دخول هذا المجال يتطلب مهارات معقدة. أما الآن، فالأدوات اللازمة لبناء هذه الخدمات أصبحت هي نفسها تعتمد على الذكاء الاصطناعي، مما يسهل الوصول إليها واستخدامها.</li>
  <li><strong>الشركات بحاجة للمساعدة:</strong> أصحاب الشركات يدركون الآن وجود تحديثات وتقنيات جديدة يمكنها مساعدتهم، لكنهم لا يعرفون كيفية أو متى أو أين يمكن تطبيقها في أعمالهم.</li>
</ol>

<p>تخيل معنا أنه في عام 2030، سيكون هناك نوعان من الناس:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>النوع الأول:</strong> من استفاد من المجال، تعلم الأدوات، بنى العمليات، انضم إلى مجتمعات للتعلم، وجد عملاء، ثم بنى وكالة صغيرة، ثم وكالة كبيرة مع فريق عمل يقدم خدمات متكاملة.</li>
  <li><strong>النوع الثاني:</strong> من تجاهل الفرصة بحجة أن نماذج العمل هذه تظهر كل يوم.</li>
</ul>

<p>الوضع الحالي يشبه تمامًا ما حدث في عام 1995 عند ظهور الإنترنت. كانت الشركات تتساءل: “هل نحتاج إلى موقع ويب؟ وكيف نستخدمه؟”. اليوم، في عام 2025، تطرح الشركات نفس الأسئلة ولكن عن الذكاء الاصطناعي: “هل نحتاج إلى الذكاء الاصطناعي في عملياتنا؟ وأين نحتاجه؟ وكيف نستخدمه؟”.</p>

<h3 id="أين-نحن-الآن-في-منحنى-تبني-المنتج">أين نحن الآن في منحنى تبني المنتج؟</h3>

<p>أي منتج أو تقنية رائجة تمر بمنحنى تبني يمكن وصفه كالتالي:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>المبتكرون (Innovators):</strong> نسبة قليلة جدًا تبدأ في استكشاف التقنية.</li>
  <li><strong>المتبنون الأوائل (Early Adopters):</strong> يكتشفون التقنية وينضمون مباشرة. السوق في هذه المرحلة لا يزال غير مزدحم.</li>
  <li><strong>الأغلبية المبكرة (Early Majority):</strong> هنا تصبح التقنية رائجة، والجميع يسمع بها. نحن الآن في هذه المرحلة تقريبًا، حيث لا يوجد شخص لا يعرف أن هناك أدوات يمكنها بناء الأتمتة.</li>
  <li><strong>الأغلبية المتأخرة (Late Majority):</strong> يصبح السوق مشبعًا إلى حد ما.</li>
  <li><strong>المتخلفون (Laggards):</strong> يدخلون في النهاية عندما يكون السوق مشبعًا تمامًا ولا يحصلون على شيء.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>ملاحظة هامة:</strong> لا تجعل أعداد المشاهدات أو القراء تخدعك. إذا وجدت مقالًا نُشر قبل يومين وحصد 50 ألف قارئ، قد تعتقد أن الفرصة ضاعت وأنك متأخر. لكن بصراحة، عدد القراء ليس معيارًا حقيقيًا. نسبة الأشخاص الذين يطبقون ما يتعلمونه ويحاولون العثور على عملاء ويستمرون بعد الفشل لا تتجاوز 5% إلى 15% كحد أقصى.</p>

<h3 id="ما-الذي-تحتاجه-للبدء">ما الذي تحتاجه للبدء؟</h3>

<p>أخي العزيز أو أختي العزيزة، ليس عليك أن تكون خبيرًا في الذكاء الاصطناعي أو لديك شهادة من معهد ماساتشوستس للتكنولوجيا أو هارفارد. ليس عليك أن تكون لديك خبرة في البرمجة أو في إدارة الأعمال. لكن هناك نقطة مهمة جدًا، إذا تجاهلتها، ستضيع شهورًا قادمة: <strong>يجب أن تكون لديك المعرفة والمهارات اللازمة لبناء عمل تجاري عبر الإنترنت.</strong></p>

<p>لا تحتاج إلى وقت فراغ كبير. خصص فقط ساعتين من يومك خلال الأشهر الثلاثة القادمة، وستجد نتائج. هذا المجال جديد، عمره أقل من ثلاث سنوات عالميًا، لذلك لا توجد أعذار.</p>

<h3 id="ما-هي-الخدمات-التي-يمكنك-تقديمها">ما هي الخدمات التي يمكنك تقديمها؟</h3>

<p>القيمة التي ستقدمها للعميل لتتمكن من تحقيق الدخل من خدماتك يمكن أن تكون واحدة من أربع فئات رئيسية:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>الاستشارات (Consultation):</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>تشرح لأصحاب الأعمال ما هو الذكاء الاصطناعي وكيف يمكنهم استخدامه.</li>
      <li>تقوم بمراجعة عملياتهم (من التسويق إلى خدمة العملاء) وتحدد نقاط التحسين.</li>
      <li>تقدم لهم خريطة طريق واضحة ورؤية لتبني الذكاء الاصطناعي في أعمالهم.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>بناء الأنظمة (Systems):</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>الأتمتة (Automation):</strong> بناء سير عمل (Workflow) لتحويل عملية يدوية إلى عملية مؤتمتة تعمل على مدار 24 ساعة طوال أيام الأسبوع، مما يزيد من إيرادات الشركة ويحل مشاكلها.</li>
      <li><strong>الوكلاء الأذكياء (AI Agents):</strong> تطوير وكلاء أذكياء (مثل وكيل خدمة العملاء أو مساعد تطوير الأعمال) لديهم القدرة على اتخاذ قرارات وتنفيذ مهام معقدة، على عكس سير العمل التلقائي.</li>
      <li><strong>خدمات أخرى:</strong> تقديم خدمات مثل إنشاء المحتوى (UGC)، أو هندسة الأوامر (Prompting)، أو إدارة الإعلانات باستخدام الذكاء الاصطناعي.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>التعليم (Education):</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>تدريب فرق العمل في الشركات على كيفية استخدام الأنظمة المؤتمتة والتعامل مع الذكاء الاصطناعي في عملياتهم اليومية.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>البرمجيات كخدمة (SaaS - Software as a Service):</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>هذا هو المستوى الأصعب، حيث يتطلب بناء برمجيات متكاملة مثل Canva أو Notion.</li>
      <li>يحتاج إلى مطورين أو خبرة متقدمة، ومن الأفضل البدء بأدوات “No-Code” (بدون برمجة) أولاً.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="هل-يجب-أن-أتخصص-في-مجال-معين">هل يجب أن أتخصص في مجال معين؟</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>إذا كانت لديك خبرة سابقة:</strong> (مثلاً في التجارة الإلكترونية)، فمن الذكاء أن تتخصص في هذا المجال. استخدم خبرتك لتطوير أنظمة ذكاء اصطناعي خاصة بالتجارة الإلكترونية.</li>
  <li><strong>إذا لم تكن لديك خبرة:</strong> حاول أن تتعلم شيئًا عن كل شيء في البداية. تعلم الأدوات المختلفة (مثل Make, Zapier) واكتسب خلفية تقنية. بعد ذلك، يمكنك تحليل عمليات أي شركة وتقديم خدماتك.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="كيف-تجد-العملاء-monetization">كيف تجد العملاء (Monetization)؟</h3>

<p>هذه هي العقبة التي يواجهها معظم الناس. هناك طريقتان رئيسيتان:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>الاستقطاب الداخلي (Inbound):</strong> العميل هو الذي يأتي إليك.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>الإعلانات المدفوعة:</strong> على منصات Meta, TikTok, Snapchat.</li>
      <li><strong>التسويق بالمحتوى:</strong> إنشاء محتوى قيم على يوتيوب، أو مدونة، أو رسالة إخبارية (Newsletter) لجذب المهتمين.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>الاستقطاب الخارجي (Outbound):</strong> أنت الذي تذهب إلى العميل.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>الرسائل المباشرة (Cold DMs):</strong> إرسال رسائل على Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIn, Twitter.</li>
      <li><strong>التواصل البارد (Cold Outreach):</strong> عبر البريد الإلكتروني أو المكالمات.</li>
      <li><strong>المجتمعات (Communities):</strong> البحث في مجتمعات مثل Reddit أو Facebook عن أشخاص يبحثون عن خبراء لتوظيفهم أو التعاون معهم.</li>
      <li><strong>منصات العمل الحر (Freelance Platforms):</strong> بناء ملف شخصي قوي ومعرض أعمال على منصات مثل Upwork, Fiverr, Khamsat.</li>
      <li><strong>العلاقات الدافئة (Warm Connections):</strong> التواصل مع معارفك الذين يملكون شركات أو وكالات تسويق وعرض خدماتك عليهم.</li>
      <li><strong>الشركات المحلية (Local Businesses):</strong> إذا كانت لديك الجرأة، يمكنك الذهاب مباشرة إلى الشركات المحلية وعرض خدماتك.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>نقطة مهمة:</strong> معرفة “ماذا تفعل” لا يكفي. يجب أن تعرف “كيف تفعله”. معرفة أنه يجب أن يكون لديك ملف شخصي على Upwork شيء، ومعرفة كيفية كتابة عرض (Proposal) مقنع يجعل العميل يختارك بالسعر الذي تحدده شيء آخر تمامًا.</p>

<h3 id="كيف-تبدأ-الخطوات-العملية">كيف تبدأ؟ (الخطوات العملية)</h3>

<ol>
  <li><strong>تعلم:</strong> تعلم كيف تقدم قيمة حقيقية وتطور مهاراتك التقنية.</li>
  <li><strong>طبق:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>ابنِ مشاريعك الخاصة.</li>
      <li>أنشئ نسخة مصغرة قابلة للتطبيق (MVP) من المشاريع الكبيرة.</li>
      <li>اصنع عروضًا توضيحية (Demos) وشاركها مع العملاء المحتملين أو في المجتمعات.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>حقق الدخل (Monetize):</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>احصل على عميلك الأول.</li>
      <li>اجمع التقييمات والآراء (Testimonials).</li>
      <li>حسن عملياتك بناءً على ملاحظات العملاء.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="كيف-تبدو-عملية-العمل-مع-العميل">كيف تبدو عملية العمل مع العميل؟</h3>

<ol>
  <li><strong>مكالمة استكشافية (Discovery Call):</strong> لفهم طبيعة عمل العميل، وتحديد نطاق المشروع، والتأكد من أنه مناسب للعمل معه.</li>
  <li><strong>المكالمة الثانية (Second Call):</strong> لمناقشة العرض، وتقديم نسخة مصغرة من الحل، والاتفاق على التفاصيل.</li>
  <li><strong>العقد (Contract):</strong> يمكن أن يكون الدفع مرة واحدة، أو بالساعة، أو شهريًا، أو بناءً على مراحل إنجاز المشروع (Milestones).</li>
  <li><strong>الدفع المسبق (Upfront Payment):</strong> عادةً ما يتم طلب دفعة مقدمة (30-40%) لبدء المشروع.</li>
  <li><strong>بدء العمل والتطوير (Start Working):</strong> تبدأ في تطوير الحل مع تقديم تحديثات أسبوعية للعميل.</li>
  <li><strong>المكالمة الأخيرة (Last Call):</strong> عند اكتمال المنتج، تقوم باختباره مباشرة مع العميل.</li>
  <li><strong>التسليم النهائي والتقييم (Full Payment &amp; Testimonial):</strong> إذا كان العميل راضيًا، يقوم بالدفع الكامل، وتطلب منه تقييمًا أو شهادة (Testimonial) لتعزيز ملفك.</li>
  <li><strong>الدعم والمتابعة (Support &amp; Follow-up):</strong> حافظ على علاقتك بالعميل من خلال المتابعة وتقديم الدعم لضمان استمرارية العمل في المستقبل.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="بناء-الفريق-والتوسع">بناء الفريق والتوسع</h3>

<p>مع نمو عملك، ستحتاج إلى بناء فريق. يمكنك إما توظيف أعضاء جدد أو التعاون مع مستقلين آخرين بنظام المشاركة في الأرباح. للتوسع، ستحتاج إلى المزيد من المطورين، وعلامة تجارية شخصية قوية، والمزيد من العملاء، وأنظمة تشغيل موحدة (SOPs) لضمان جودة العمل.</p>

<p>ركز على خبرتك، وعلى بناء الثقة، وعلى النتائج. يمكنك فعلها.</p>

            <p>إذا عدت بالزمن يا صديقي القارئ إلى عام 2009 وحاولت أن تبحث عن قائمة أكثر الهاكرز المطلوبين للإنتربول الدولي ومكتب التحقيقات الفيدرالي (FBI) في ذلك الوقت، ستظهر لك مجموعة من الأسماء، أسماء الهاكرز الذين يُعتبرون الأقوى والأخطر في العالم. من بين هذه الأسماء، سوف تستغرب لأنك ستجد اسمًا عربيًا: حمزة بن دلاج، مواليد الجزائر، العمر 21، مطلوب بتهمة السرقة من 200 بنك حول العالم بمبلغ يُقدر بأكثر من 200 مليون دولار.</p>

<p>في مقال اليوم سنتحدث عن أشهر هاكر عربي، حمزة بن دلاج. والسبب ليس لأنه لم يتحدث أحد عن قصته أو أنه لا أحد يعرفها، بل على العكس، هناك عشرات المقالات والمحتويات التي تناولت قصة حمزة، ومن المؤكد أن أغلبكم قد شاهد أو قرأ عن هذا الشخص. لكنني كتبت هذا المقال لعدة أسباب:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>الدقة:</strong> مع احترامي للمبدعين، إلا أن أغلبهم كانوا يذكرون في أعمالهم إشاعات عن حمزة، أشياء لم يتم تأكيدها لا من قبل مصدر موثوق ولا حتى من حمزة نفسه، مثل الإشاعة التي كان مفادها أنه كان يتبرع للدول الفقيرة. فلم يتحدث أحد ويذكر القصة الحرفية والحقيقية.</li>
  <li><strong>التفاصيل التقنية:</strong> الكل كان يقول إن حمزة فعل كذا، حمزة هكر كذا، حمزة اخترق كذا، لكن لم يشرح أحد بالتحديد كيف كان حمزة يفعل كل هذه الأشياء، ما هي الأدوات والبرامج التي كان يستخدمها، ولا حتى كيف كان يستخدمها.</li>
  <li><strong>المستجدات:</strong> السبب الثالث والأهم هو أن حمزة خرج من السجن قبل فترة قليلة. أخيرًا بعد 11 سنة سجن، أطلقت السجون الأمريكية سراحه ورجع إلى بلده وعائلته بالجزائر. لكن حتى هذا الأمر كان عليه الكثير من علامات الاستفهام، فكيف استطاع الخروج قبل أربع سنوات من مدة الحكم الرسمية التي من المفترض أن تكون 15 سنة؟</li>
</ol>

<p>ولهذا السبب، جهز نفسك يا صديقي القارئ، لأننا سنغوص في قصة الشاب العربي الذي ظهر من العدم ليصبح واحدًا من أشهر الهاكرز في العالم.</p>

<h3 id="البدايات-والتعليم">البدايات والتعليم</h3>

<p>قصة حمزة في بدايته لم تكن غريبة، فهو وُلد عام 1988 في مدينة تيزي وزو الموجودة شرق العاصمة بالجزائر، وكان شخصًا ذكيًا بالفطرة منذ صغره. عندما كبر، دخل جامعة باب الزوار ودرس بها تخصص الإعلام الآلي، لكن هذا لم يكن شغف حمزة. شغفه الأساسي كان متعلقًا بالتكنولوجيا والكمبيوتر، كان فعلًا مدمنًا على هذا المجال. معارفه وعائلته صرحوا بأنه كان يجلس ساعات، وأحيانًا أيامًا كاملة، أمام شاشة الحاسوب وهو يتعلم أكثر وأكثر عن هذا العالم الإلكتروني.</p>

<p>وبسبب هوسه المبالغ فيه، يمكن القول إنه تعلم وعرف كل شيء يخص هذا العالم، من برمجيات الحاسوب المتعلقة ببرامجه وأنظمته حتى برمجة المواقع والتطبيقات على الإنترنت. ومن هذه النقطة، يمكن القول إن قصتنا بدأت.</p>

<p>عندما صار حمزة يحاول أن يتعلم أكثر وأكثر عن المواقع والبرامج، رأى أنه في البداية يجب أن يفهم الأساس. كان يرغب في معرفة كيف تم تصميم هذه البرامج من الصفر، لذلك بدأ يتعلم لغات البرمجة. لغات البرمجة التي، كما نعلم جميعًا، تعتبر الأساس لبرمجة وإنشاء وتكوين المواقع والبرامج. وفعلًا، قضى حمزة وقتًا طويلًا وهو يدرس لغات البرمجة الأساسية مثل C++, Python, PHP, و Java.</p>

<h3 id="اكتشاف-الثغرات">اكتشاف الثغرات</h3>

<p>عندما تمكن من هذا المجال وفهمه بنسبة 100%، بدأ يلاحظ شيئًا غريبًا. بدأ يلاحظ أنه على الرغم من احترافية ودقة لغات البرمجة، إلا أن أغلب البرامج التي تُطور من خلالها بها ثغرات، بها نقاط ضعف أو أخطاء برمجية. هذه الثغرات لو وقعت في يد هاكر، فسيتمكن من اختراق نظام البرنامج أو الموقع بسهولة تامة.</p>

<p>عند هذه النقطة، يجب أن نتوقف قليلًا، لأن أغلب الناس يقولون إن حمزة بعدما اكتشف هذه الثغرات صار يتواصل مع الشركات ويتعاون معهم لإصلاح الثغرات الموجودة داخل برامجهم مقابل مبلغ مادي، لكن هذا الشيء ليس صحيحًا، فلا يوجد أي مصدر موثوق يؤكد هذه المعلومة.</p>

<h3 id="الدخول-إلى-عالم-القرصنة">الدخول إلى عالم القرصنة</h3>

<p>المهم، ما حدث بعد ذلك هو أن حمزة اتخذ قرارًا سيغير مجرى حياته إلى الأبد، فقد قرر أن يستخدم هذه الثغرات لمصالحه الشخصية. فصار يبحث عن طريقة يستفيد بها ماديًا من الخبرة والمعلومات التي اكتسبها. وفعليًا، كانت هناك الكثير من الطرق التي كانت ستوصله إلى هذا الهدف، لكن كما نعلم جميعًا، اختار حمزة أن يدخل عالم القرصنة الإلكترونية.</p>

<p>في بداية طريقه في هذا المجال، بدأ يفعل الشيء الذي يبرع به، وهو التعلم. بدأ يتعلم كل شيء يخص التهكير من الألف إلى الياء: طرق التهكير، الأدوات التي تُستخدم للتهكير، كيف يمكن للهاكر أن يغسل الأموال التي يحصل عليها حتى لا تتم مطاردته من الحكومات، وكيف يخفي هويته وموقعه داخل هذا العالم الإلكتروني.</p>

<p>وفعلًا، توغل حمزة في هذا المجال، ويمكن القول إنه أتقن كل شيء يخص عالم الهاكينج. وبعد أن أصبح لديه هذا الكم من المعرفة والخبرة، أطلق العنان لنفسه أخيرًا وبدأ طريقه في عالم التهكير، وأطلق على نفسه لقب “BX1”.</p>

<p>في البداية، عمل بمفرده. كان يذهب ويستهدف البنوك والمصارف الصغيرة ليكشف الثغرات الأمنية الموجودة داخلها، ومن خلال هذه الثغرات يخترق النظام ويحول لحسابه الخاص مبالغ مالية من الحسابات الموجودة داخل هذه البنوك. لكن هناك نقطة مهمة يجب أن نعرفها، وهي أنه كان يستهدف بنوكًا صغيرة ويأخذ أيضًا مبالغ صغيرة من هذه البنوك.</p>

<p>استمر حمزة على هذا النمط لفترة من الزمن، كان يهكر البنوك بسهولة، بنكًا تلو الآخر، وحسابًا تلو الآخر. لكنه، كما قلنا، كان يستهدف بنوكًا صغيرة أو غير معروفة ويأخذ منها مبالغ نقدية قليلة. وهذا كان لسببين، وهذان السببان كانا عبارة عن نقاط ضعف موجودة عند حمزة. فعلى الرغم من أنه من أمهر الأشخاص وأذكاهم في المجال، إلا أنه كانت لديه نقاط ضعف:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>إخفاء الهوية:</strong> لم تكن لديه أداة احترافية يستطيع من خلالها إخفاء هويته. فلو حاول أن يسرق مبلغًا نقديًا ضخمًا من أحد البنوك المعروفة، فالأنظمة المتطورة الموجودة داخل هذا البنك ستكشف هويته بسهولة تامة.</li>
  <li><strong>غسيل الأموال:</strong> لم تكن لديه طريقة يستطيع من خلالها غسل أموال بمبالغ ضخمة. هو كان يسرق مبالغ قليلة لا تتعدى عدة آلاف، وهذه المبالغ لو حولها على حسابه البنكي الشخصي بشكل مباشر، لن يحدث له شيء. لكن المشكلة تحدث عندما يحاول تحويل مبالغ ضخمة لحسابه، فالحكومات مباشرة ستجمد الحساب وتبدأ بملاحقته لتعرف من أين أتى بهذه الأموال.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="تطوير-برنامج-سباي-آي-spyeye">تطوير برنامج “سباي آي” (SpyEye)</h3>

<p>لاحقًا، وجد حمزة حلًا للمشكلتين. كان يدخل إلى منتديات سرية موجودة داخل شبكة الدارك ويب. هذه المنتديات السرية تكون عبارة عن مكان يتجمع به الهاكرز ليتواصلوا مع بعضهم البعض ويتبادلوا المعلومات المتعلقة بالهاكينج. ومن خلال هذه المنتديات، تعرف حمزة على الكثير من الهاكرز وكوّن الكثير من الصداقات.</p>

<p>أحد أصدقائه الهاكرز هؤلاء كان هو الحل، وهو شخص روسي اسمه ألكسندر أندريفيتش بانين. هذا الهاكر عرض على حمزة فكرة، فكرة أن يتشاركا ويطورا برنامج تهكير اسمه “سباي آي” (SpyEye). سيستفيدان من هذا البرنامج بطريقتين:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>الطريقة الأولى:</strong> هما أنفسهما سيستخدمانه ليسهل عليهما عملية الاختراق.</li>
  <li><strong>الطريقة الثانية:</strong> سيبيعانه على شبكة الدارك ويب للهاكرز الآخرين.</li>
</ul>

<p>الفكرة أعجبت بن دلاج بمجرد أن سمعها، وفعلًا هو وهذا الهاكر الروسي طورا وصمما البرنامج.</p>

<h3 id="كيف-يعمل-سباي-آي">كيف يعمل “سباي آي”؟</h3>

<p>الآن، أود منك أن تركز معي يا صديقي القارئ، لأنني سأشرح لك فكرة التطبيق التي ستنبهر منها حقًا.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>الزرع:</strong> يبدأ الهاكر بالبحث عن موقع عشوائي على الإنترنت توجد به ثغرة في البرمجة. ولنفترض أنه وجد ثغرة في موقع ويكيبيديا. يقوم الهاكر بجلب برنامج “سباي آي” ويزرعه داخل هذه الثغرة.</li>
  <li><strong>الإصابة:</strong> عندما يحاول أي شخص الدخول إلى ويكيبيديا، سينزل “سباي آي” على جهازه بشكل تلقائي.</li>
  <li><strong>التخفي:</strong> بعد أن ينزل، سيندمج مع أي برنامج موجود داخل الجهاز ليتمكن من إخفاء نفسه من الضحية (صاحب الجهاز) ومن أي مضاد فيروسات موجود.</li>
  <li><strong>التحكم الكامل:</strong> من تلك النقطة، يبدأ عمل الهاكر. “سباي آي” سيعطيه الصلاحية الكاملة بالتحكم بجهاز الضحية: يستطيع تنزيل برامج عليه، أخذ معلومات منه، مراقبته، وغيرها الكثير من الصلاحيات.</li>
</ol>

<p>لكن الهدف الرئيسي الذي صُمم برنامج “سباي آي” من أجله هو المال الموجود في الحساب البنكي للضحية. ويستطيع البرنامج أن يوصل الهاكر إلى هذا المال من خلال طرق كثيرة:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>تسجيل ضغطات المفاتيح:</strong> عندما يحاول الضحية إدخال كلمة سر حسابه المصرفي، سيحفظ البرنامج الأزرار التي تم الضغط عليها في لوحة المفاتيح ويرسلها للهاكر بالترتيب. وهكذا يتمكن الهاكر من معرفة كلمة سر الحساب واختراقه بسهولة.</li>
  <li><strong>صفحات الدفع المزيفة:</strong> عندما يجري الضحية عملية شراء إلكترونية، سيُظهر له البرنامج صفحة مزيفة شبيهة بصفحة الدفع الإلكترونية الحقيقية. وبمجرد أن يدخل هذا الشخص معلوماته البنكية، سيرسل البرنامج هذه الصفحة بجميع المعلومات المسجلة داخلها إلى الهاكر.</li>
  <li><strong>اعتراض البيانات:</strong> هذه الطريقة تشبه نوعًا ما الطريقة الثانية، لكن هذه المرة صفحة الدفع الإلكترونية ستكون حقيقية. لكن الخدعة تحدث عندما يؤكد الضحية عملية الشراء ويضغط “تأكيد” ويرسل البيانات. “سباي آي” سيمنع هذه البيانات من الذهاب إلى الخادم التابع للبنك مباشرة، بل سيجعلها تذهب أولًا إلى الهاكر ليأخذ المعلومات المسجلة داخلها، وبعد ذلك يسمح لها بالذهاب إلى خوادم البنك.</li>
  <li><strong>التستر والتزييف:</strong> بعد أن يدخل الهاكر إلى حساب ذلك الشخص ويسحب منه مبلغًا معينًا من المال ويحوله لنفسه، كل هذه العملية سيتستر عليها البرنامج. سيزيف الرصيد المالي الموجود في الحساب ليبدو أنه لم يُسحب منه أي شيء، وأيضًا سيمسح سجلات الدخول التي قام بها الهاكر.</li>
</ul>

<p>بالمختصر، كان هذا البرنامج برنامج قرصنة كاملًا متكاملًا.</p>

<h3 id="السقوط-والاعتقال">السقوط والاعتقال</h3>

<p>هل تتذكر المشكلتين اللتين كانتا عند حمزة يا صديقي القارئ؟</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>المشكلة الأولى (إخفاء الهوية):</strong> انحلت من خلال “سباي آي”. فباستخدام هذا البرنامج وتشغيل برامج VPN (التي بالمناسبة كانت شيئًا متطورًا جدًا في ذلك الوقت)، أصبح من الصعب جدًا تعقب مكانه أو محاولة معرفة هويته.</li>
  <li><strong>المشكلة الثانية (غسيل الأموال):</strong> انحلت من خلال صديقه الروسي الذي علمه كيف يفتح حسابات مزيفة في بنوك حول العالم. وبهذا، أصبح يستطيع اختراق بنوك عالمية دون أن يخاف من انكشاف هويته، وأيضًا أصبح يستطيع سحب أموال بمبالغ غير محدودة وإيداعها في هذه الحسابات.</li>
</ul>

<p>وفعلًا، ما بين عامي 2009 و2011، بدأ حمزة من خلال استخدامه لـ “سباي آي” بعمليات اختراق ضخمة. شملت عمليات الاختراق هذه أكثر من 200 بنك عالمي، استطاع أن يسحب منهم أكثر من 280 مليون دولار. وفوق كل هذا، كان مستمرًا مع صديقه الروسي في بيع وتطوير نسخ من برنامج “سباي آي”. وفعليًا، طورا منه تقريبًا 11 نسخة وباعوها لأكثر من 150 هاكر بمبالغ تبدأ من 1000 دولار لتصل إلى 8000 دولار.</p>

<p>بعد كل الشهرة التي اكتسبها البرنامج وبعد كل المشاكل التي سببها الهاكرز من خلاله، سلطت حكومات العالم كلها الضوء عليه. في تلك اللحظة، أدركوا أنهم يجب أن يوقفوا ما يحدث بأي شكل من الأشكال. فاتحد مكتب التحقيقات الفيدرالي (FBI) وشركات كثيرة مختصة بالأمن السيبراني للإطاحة بالهاكرز المسؤولين عن البرنامج.</p>

<p>بدأوا بعمليات تحقيق ضخمة لمحاولة معرفة هويات هؤلاء الهاكرز. استخدموا في هذه العمليات الكثير من طرق التحقيق، لدرجة أن أحد عملاء الـ FBI تظاهر بأنه هاكر ودخل إلى الدارك ويب وتواصل مع حمزة وصديقه الروسي واشترى منهم نسخة من برنامج “سباي آي”.</p>

<p>وفعلًا، بفضل هذا العمل التعاوني المكثف واستراتيجية التحقيقات التي تتبعت أنشطتهم على الإنترنت، تمكنت السلطات أخيرًا في عام 2011 من معرفة هوية حمزة بن دلاج. وإذا سألتني عن كيفية تمكنهم من فعل ذلك، فالكثير من الأشياء أدت إلى كشف هوية حمزة، لكن كان أهمها أنه في إحدى عمليات الاختراق التي كان يجريها، نسي أن يخفي عنوان الـ IP الخاص به، والذي يكون بمثابة رقم تعريفي لكل جهاز متصل بالإنترنت. يستطيع الأمن السيبراني أن يعرف مكان أي جهاز من خلال تتبع عنوان الـ IP الخاص به. وهذا الـ IP كان حمزة يخفيه دائمًا أثناء عمليات الاختراق التي يقوم بها، لكن في تلك المرة بالذات كان ناسيًا أن يخفيه، فتتبعوه حتى عرفوا هويته وكل شيء عنه.</p>

<p>ومع أن حمزة شخص ذكي وماهر بالفطرة ومتمكن من كل شيء كان يفعله، إلا أنه إنسان، والإنسان ليس كاملًا، فلا بد أنه سيخطئ في إحدى المرات.</p>

<p>بكشف هويته، أصبح مطلوبًا للقبض عليه من قبل عدة وكالات أمنية حول العالم، من بينهم مكتب التحقيقات الفيدرالي الأمريكي (FBI) والشرطة الدولية (الإنتربول). الإنتربول الذي اعتبره في ذلك الوقت من ضمن أخطر عشرة هاكرز مطلوبين حول العالم.</p>

<p>بما أن حمزة كان في الجزائر، لم يكونوا قادرين على الوصول إليه. وبهذا، وضعوا خطة ذكية جدًا ليتمكنوا من خلالها من القبض عليه. في البداية، لم يجعلوا حمزة يعرف أنه انكشف أو أنه مطلوب للقبض عليه، بل تركوه على راحته، لكنهم في نفس الوقت تتبعوا حساباته البنكية. وعندما تمكنوا من الوصول إليها، وضعوها تحت المراقبة المشددة دون أن يغلقوها أو يحجزوا عليها أو حتى يسحبوا منها قرشًا واحدًا. استخدموا هذه الحسابات كفخ لحمزة، فهو عاجلًا أم آجلًا سيأتي ويحاول سحب مال من أحد هذه الحسابات.</p>

<p>وفعلًا، استمروا بهذه الخطة حتى أخذ حمزة أسرته وخرج في رحلة سياحية خارج الجزائر. وأول ما خرج، كان مخططًا للذهاب إلى تايلاند ليأخذ مبلغًا ماليًا موجودًا في أحد حساباته هناك، وبعدها يكمل طريقه إلى مصر هو وعائلته.</p>

<p>وبتاريخ 7 يناير من عام 2013، ذهب حمزة فعلًا إلى تايلاند وسحب مالًا من حسابه الموجود هناك. وبما أن الإنتربول كانوا يراقبون حساباته أولًا بأول، وصلهم هذا الخبر مباشرة، ليبلغوا الحكومة في تايلاند بأمر القبض على حمزة ومنعه من مغادرة البلد. وهذا ما حدث بالضبط. تم القبض على بن دلاج في مطار بانكوك بتايلاند عندما كان يحاول الخروج من تايلاند وإكمال رحلته مع عائلته.</p>

<p>والشيء الغريب أن حمزة لم يقاوم نهائيًا، فقد ودع عائلته وتركهم يكملون رحلتهم إلى مصر بدونه، وبعدها سلم نفسه بكل بساطة وهدوء، لدرجة أنه كان يضحك طوال تلك الأثناء. وهذه الصور هي التي اشتهرت عالميًا وجعلت العالم يطلق عليه بعد هذه الحادثة لقب “الهاكر الضاحك” أو “الهاكر المبتسم”.</p>

<h3 id="المحاكمة-والإفراج-المفاجئ">المحاكمة والإفراج المفاجئ</h3>

<p>بعد القبض عليه، سلمته الحكومة التايلاندية لأمريكا ليتم محاكمته هناك. وبعد عدة شهور من اعتقاله، حدث شيء زاد الطين بلة، فقد قبضوا أيضًا على صديقه الروسي ألكسندر بانين في شهر يوليو من عام 2013 عندما كان مسافرًا للولايات المتحدة، وتحديدًا عندما كان في جورجيا. وبعد اعتقاله، عقد معه الـ FBI صفقة، وهي أن يوافق على التعاون معهم ويعترف بدوره في تطوير ونشر برنامج “سباي آي”، وأيضًا يخبرهم بأسماء الأشخاص الذين كانوا يعملون معه، وبالمقابل سيخففون مدة حكمه.</p>

<p>وفعلًا، وافق ألكسندر على هذا العرض واعترف بكل شيء وأخبرهم بهويات الهاكرز الذين كانوا يعملون معه، والذين كان من بينهم حمزة بن دلاج. في تلك اللحظة، تأكدت كل التهم على حمزة، الشيء الذي جعله يعترف بعدة تهم: تهمة واحدة تتعلق بالتآمر عبر الإنترنت، وعشر تهم تتعلق بالاحتيال عبر الإنترنت أيضًا، و11 تهمة تتعلق بالاحتيال وإساءة استخدام الكمبيوتر. وبكل هذه التهم، كان سيواجه عقوبة سجن تصل إلى 60 سنة وغرامة قدرها 24 مليون دولار.</p>

<p>بعد كل هذا، ظلت قضية بن دلاج معلقة لعدة سنوات، حتى نصل إلى 20 أبريل من عام 2016، السنة التي تم الحكم عليه فيها بالسجن لمدة 15 سنة وثلاث سنوات تحت المراقبة في الولايات المتحدة. وحُكم على صديقه الروسي ألكسندر أندريفيتش بانين بالسجن لمدة تسع سنوات وستة أشهر.</p>

<p>في البداية، كان من المفترض أن يُحكم على حمزة بـ 30 سنة سجن، لكن في قرار الحكم الأخير، قرروا أن يحكموا عليه بـ 15 سنة. فكان من المفترض أن يُطلق سراحه في عام 2031. لكن الغريب أنه في عام 2022، فتح حمزة بن دلاج حسابه على الإنستغرام ونزل صورته عندما تم القبض عليه وكتب تحتها: “تتذكرون هذه الضحكة؟”. وفي نفس السنة، ظهر في تسجيل صوتي يشكر به الشعب الجزائري على اهتمامهم، وبعدها صرح بالشيء الأهم وهو أنه سيخرج من السجن بتاريخ 26 مايو من عام 2024.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“أحتاج دعواتكم ونحبكم يا أولاد وبنات بلادي، كلكم في قلبي. موعد الخروج سيكون في 26 مايو 2024 أو قبل ذلك.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>كيف ولماذا حدث هذا؟ لا أحد يدري. وفعلًا، قبل أسابيع قليلة من وقت تنزيل هذا المقال، نزل بن دلاج قصة (ستوري) بها صورة له وهو داخل الطائرة متوجهًا للجزائر. وبعدها، ضجت كل وسائل التواصل الاجتماعي بخبر خروجه رسميًا من السجن. رجع إلى بلده، لعائلته، لمنزله، وحتى لحياته الطبيعية بعيدًا عن كل شيء يخص الهاكينج، حتى أن معجبيه في الجزائر صاروا يوقفونه في الشارع ويتصورون معه.</p>

<h3 id="خاتمة">خاتمة</h3>

<p>في كثير من الناس يتساءلون: هل الحكومة الجزائرية ستستثمر في مهارات وخبرة هذا الشخص أم أنهم سيتحفظون عليه؟ البعض يقول إن مهاراته لم تعد فعالة لأن التكنولوجيا تغيرت وتطورت كثيرًا منذ آخر مرة كان فيها حرًا. والبعض يقول لا، شخص مثل حمزة قادر على مواكبة التطور والتكنولوجيا والعودة كما كان وأفضل.</p>

<p>لكن بوجهة نظري، أرى أنه من المستحيل أن يرجع ويرتكب نفس الخطأ. يمكن أن يستغل مهاراته ليساعد بلده وحكومته بشكل قانوني، لكن أن يرجع إلى ما كان عليه، فهذا شيء لا أرجح أن يحدث.</p>

<p>بهذا نكون قد وصلنا إلى نهاية المقال. أتمنى أن يكون المقال قد نال إعجابكم.</p>

        <div class="p-4 flex-grow overflow-hidden">
          <p class="text-base-content">
            <p>مرحبًا بالجميع. أعمل في مجال البرمجة منذ ثماني سنوات. أنا صوفيا، مهندسة برمجيات حاليًا في أمازون، وقبل ذلك عملت لفترة وجيزة في قطاع التكنولوجيا المالية ودرست علوم الحاسوب في الجامعة. عند استعراض رحلتي، أجد أن هناك أمورًا أحسنت فيها منذ البداية، وأخرى تمنيت لو فعلتها بشكل مختلف. هذا المقال هو الدليل الأمثل الذي كنت أتمنى الحصول عليه عندما بدأت تعلم البرمجة.</p>

<p>يحتوي هذا المقال على نهج مفصل خطوة بخطوة، وموارد مفيدة، وأمثلة لمشاريع تساعد على صقل المهارات، بالإضافة إلى العقلية الصحيحة اللازمة للبرمجة. ستجد هنا كل ما تحتاجه للتحضير للمقابلات الوظيفية، والمهارات الأخرى التي يجب تطويرها إلى جانب البرمجة للنجاح كمهندس برمجيات.</p>

<h3 id="الخطوة-الأولى-فهم-الأساسيات">الخطوة الأولى: فهم الأساسيات</h3>

<p>عادةً ما تُعرض عليك مشكلة تتطلب إيجاد نتيجة بناءً على مجموعة من المدخلات. دورك كمبرمج هو تحديد سلسلة التعليمات التي يجب على الجهاز تنفيذها لتحقيق هذا الهدف. البرمجة هي عملية كتابة هذه التعليمات باتباع قواعد صياغة محددة. لكل لغة برمجة قواعدها الخاصة، لكنها جميعًا تشترك في مفاهيم أساسية واحدة، وهي:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>المتغيرات (Variables)</strong></li>
  <li><strong>أنواع البيانات (Data Types)</strong></li>
  <li><strong>الحلقات التكرارية (Loops)</strong></li>
  <li><strong>الجمل الشرطية (If Statements)</strong></li>
  <li><strong>الدوال (Functions)</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>كخطوة أولى، يجب عليك فهم هذه المفاهيم والتعود عليها. أوصي باختيار لغة برمجة واحدة والتركيز عليها فقط. هناك العديد من اللغات التي ربما سمعت بها، مثل JavaScript، TypeScript، C++، Java، و Python.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>ملاحظة:</strong> تُعتبر Python اللغة الأكثر توصية للمبتدئين، لأنها بسيطة وأقل تعقيدًا في الكتابة مقارنة بلغات أخرى مثل Java.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>بعد اختيار لغة البرمجة المفضلة لديك، الخطوة التالية هي البدء في حل المشكلات البرمجية. هناك منصتان يمكنني التوصية بهما:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Codecademy</li>
  <li>freeCodeCamp</li>
</ul>

<p>عندما تشعر بالثقة في حل المشكلات البرمجية، تكون الخطوة التالية هي تعلم <strong>البرمجة كائنية التوجه (Object-Oriented Programming)</strong> وبعض مفاهيمها مثل <strong>الفئات (Classes)</strong>. على الرغم من أن منصات مثل Codecademy ممتازة للبداية، من الجيد أيضًا تعلم كيفية كتابة وتشغيل البرامج على حاسوبك المحمول.</p>

<p>في هذه المرحلة، لديك المهارات الأساسية للبدء في كتابة بعض البرامج البسيطة. من الأمثلة على المشاريع الجيدة للبدء بها:</p>
<ul>
  <li>آلة حاسبة (Calculator)</li>
  <li>لعبة إكس-أو (Tic-Tac-Toe)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="الخطوة-الثانية-الخوارزميات-وهياكل-البيانات">الخطوة الثانية: الخوارزميات وهياكل البيانات</h3>

<p>بعد اكتساب المهارات الأساسية، من الجيد تعلم المزيد عن <strong>الخوارزميات (Algorithms)</strong> و<strong>هياكل البيانات (Data Structures)</strong>. هناك العديد من الموارد المتاحة عبر الإنترنت على منصات مثل Coursera، Udemy، أو ببساطة YouTube. لقد تابعت شخصيًا دورة تدريبية على Coursera كانت رائعة جدًا.</p>

<p>الهدف هنا ليس تعلم كل شيء، ولا ينبغي عليك فعل ذلك. أقترح البدء بـ <strong>المصفوفات (Arrays)</strong> و<strong>جداول التجزئة (Hashmaps)</strong>، فهما من أكثر هياكل البيانات استخدامًا. الهدف الحقيقي هو مساعدتك على تعلم أدوات لحل تحديات برمجية أكبر.</p>

<h3 id="الخطوة-الثالثة-بنية-الأنظمة-وتصميمها">الخطوة الثالثة: بنية الأنظمة وتصميمها</h3>

<p>والآن نأتي إلى الجزء الممتع: تعلم <strong>بنية الأنظمة (Architecture)</strong> أو <strong>تصميم الأنظمة (System Design)</strong>. أبسط بنية أساسية تتكون من:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>العميل (Client)</strong></li>
  <li><strong>الخادم (Server)</strong></li>
  <li><strong>قاعدة البيانات (Database)</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>لنفكر في موقع ويب يتيح للمستخدمين إنشاء وحفظ المستندات.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>العميل:</strong> يشير إلى التطبيق الذي يواجه المستخدم، ويوفر الواجهة التي يمكن للمستخدمين من خلالها إنشاء حساب وتسجيل الدخول وإدارة ملاحظاتهم.</li>
  <li><strong>قاعدة البيانات:</strong> تعمل كوحدة تخزين لحفظ هذه المستندات.</li>
  <li><strong>الخادم:</strong> هو مكون النظام المسؤول عن استقبال طلبات القراءة والكتابة من العميل، والوصول في النهاية إلى قاعدة البيانات لتلبية هذه الطلبات.</li>
</ul>

<p>هناك ثلاثة مصطلحات شائعة جدًا في وصف وظائف مهندسي البرمجيات: <strong>الواجهة الأمامية (Front-end)</strong>، و<strong>الواجهة الخلفية (Back-end)</strong>، و<strong>المطور الشامل (Full-stack)</strong>.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>مهندس الواجهة الأمامية:</strong> متخصص في الجزء الذي يواجهه العميل من الخدمة. على سبيل المثال، هم من يقومون بتنفيذ تصميمات مواقع الويب، ويكونون خبراء في استخدام JavaScript، TypeScript، CSS، و HTML.</li>
  <li><strong>مهندس الواجهة الخلفية:</strong> عادة ما يكون مسؤولاً عن جزء الخدمة الذي يتعامل مع الطلبات وقواعد البيانات. اللغات المستخدمة هنا تشمل Java و Python.</li>
  <li><strong>المطور الشامل:</strong> هو من يستطيع القيام بكلا الأمرين، بالإضافة إلى تطوير تطبيقات الجوال (iOS أو Android).</li>
</ul>

<p>مفهوم آخر مثير للاهتمام في هذه المرحلة هو <strong>واجهات برمجة التطبيقات (APIs)</strong>، وهي الطريقة التي تتواصل بها الخدمات مع بعضها البعض.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>توصية:</strong> تصميم الأنظمة هو المجال الذي تكمن فيه الصعوبة الحقيقية عند العمل كمهندس برمجيات. كتاب رائع أوصي به هو <strong>“Designing Data-Intensive Applications”</strong> لمؤلفه مارتن كليبمان. هذا هو الكتاب الذي تحتاجه حقًا لمعرفة المزيد عن كيفية تصميم الأنظمة، ومكوناتها المختلفة، وأنواع قواعد البيانات الموجودة، وغير ذلك الكثير.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="الخطوة-الرابعة-بناء-المشاريع-الشخصية">الخطوة الرابعة: بناء المشاريع الشخصية</h3>

<p>الآن بعد أن أصبحت لديك فكرة عن كيفية تصميم وتطوير تطبيقات الويب، قد ترغب في بدء مشروعك الشخصي. هنا ستحتاج إلى تعلم <strong>أطر العمل (Frameworks)</strong>. أشهرها:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>للواجهات الأمامية:</strong> React و Angular.</li>
  <li><strong>للواجهات الخلفية:</strong> Django و Spring.</li>
  <li><strong>لتطوير تطبيقات الجوال:</strong> React Native يعد نقطة انطلاق جيدة.</li>
</ul>

<p>قبل البدء في تنفيذ مشاريع أكثر تعقيدًا، هناك أداتان يجب أن تتعلمهما:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>أداة التحكم في الإصدار (Version Control):</strong> تساعدك على تتبع وإدارة شيفرة المصدر الخاصة بك. أشهرها <strong>Git</strong>، وبالتالي تحتاج أيضًا إلى تعلم <strong>GitHub</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>بيئة التطوير المتكاملة (IDE):</strong> وهي تطبيق برمجي يساعدك على تطوير شيفرتك بكفاءة أكبر. من أشهرها <strong>VS Code</strong> و <strong>IntelliJ</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>تُعد <strong>الهاكاثونات (Hackathons)</strong> فرصة رائعة لبدء مشروعك الخاص. هناك فعاليات مختلفة في جميع أنحاء العالم، سواء كانت حضورية أو عبر الإنترنت. أوصي بشدة بالتحقق من موقع Major League Hacking للعثور على فعالية مناسبة لك. سيساعدك هذا أيضًا على التواصل مع الآخرين والتعلم منهم، وهو أمر مهم جدًا في هذا المجال.</p>

<p>بعض الأمثلة على المشاريع الشخصية:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>إنشاء موقعك الشخصي:</strong> طريقة رائعة لممارسة مهاراتك، وفي النهاية ستحصل على شيء يمكنك عرضه على الآخرين.</li>
  <li><strong>تطبيق قائمة مهام (To-Do List App).</strong></li>
  <li><strong>تطبيق للطقس (Weather App)</strong> يتصل بواجهة برمجة تطبيقات عامة.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="العقلية-الصحيحة-للمبرمج">العقلية الصحيحة للمبرمج</h3>

<p>نأمل في هذه المرحلة أن تكون لديك كل المعرفة والأدوات اللازمة للنمو والتقدم كمبرمج. الشيء التالي الذي سنتحدث عنه هو العقلية الصحيحة التي يجب أن تتمتع بها:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>كن متواضعًا ومنفتحًا للتعلم وتلقي الملاحظات:</strong> هناك الكثير لتتعلمه، وتلقي الملاحظات هو أحد الأشياء التي يمكن أن تساعدك على تطوير مهاراتك والتعلم من أخطائك.</li>
  <li><strong>لا تقم بنسخ الشيفرة أبدًا إلا إذا كنت تعرف ما تفعله بالضبط:</strong> درب نفسك على التفكير في الحل أولاً قبل البحث عنه. سيساعدك هذا على تطوير مهارات حل المشكلات، وهي مهمة جدًا في حياتك المهنية لاحقًا.</li>
  <li><strong>استمتع بالرحلة:</strong> تستغرق البرمجة الكثير من الوقت والتفاني، لذلك من الأفضل أن تجد المتعة والرضا في المغامرة نفسها.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="التحضير-للمقابلات-الوظيفية">التحضير للمقابلات الوظيفية</h3>

<p>الآن بعد أن أصبحت لديك خبرة قوية في البرمجة، وبنيت مجموعة من المشاريع المثيرة للاهتمام وأضفتها إلى سيرتك الذاتية، قد تبدأ في إجراء مقابلات للحصول على تدريب أو وظيفة أولى. هناك نوعان من الشركات من حيث نهج المقابلات:</p>

<p><strong>1. النهج غير المعتمد على لغة محددة (Language-Agnostic):</strong>
هذه الشركات منفتحة لتوظيف مطورين يتقنون لغات برمجة مختلفة. لهذا السبب، في مقابلاتهم، عادة ما تختار اللغة التي ترغب في البرمجة بها. الشركات الشهيرة التي تتبع هذا النهج هي شركات التكنولوجيا الكبرى (FAANG). يتطلب التحضير لمقابلاتهم إتقان موضوعين:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>الخوارزميات وهياكل البيانات:</strong> أوصي بشدة بكتاب <strong>“Cracking the Coding Interview”</strong>. شخصيًا، هذا هو الكتاب الوحيد الذي درست منه هذا الموضوع. إتقان التمارين فيه سيساعدك على التحضير.</li>
  <li><strong>تصميم الأنظمة:</strong> سأوصي مرة أخرى بكتاب <strong>“Designing Data-Intensive Applications”</strong>. أعتقد أنه الكتاب المثالي للتحضير لهذه المقابلات. إذا لم يكن لديك الكثير من الوقت، فهناك أيضًا كتاب <strong>“System Design Interview”</strong> وهو جيد جدًا أيضًا.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2. النهج المعتمد على لغة محددة (Language-Specific):</strong>
تبحث هذه الشركات عن مطورين يمتلكون مهارات محددة ويتقنون لغة أو إطار عمل معين. هنا، يجب أن تكون متقنًا لتلك المهارات وقادرًا على الإجابة على أي نوع من الأسئلة التي قد تُطرح عليك.</p>

<h3 id="مهارات-تكتسبها-أثناء-العمل">مهارات تكتسبها أثناء العمل</h3>

<p>أخيرًا، أردت أن أتحدث عن بعض المهارات المحددة التي تطورها فقط عندما تعمل كمهندس برمجيات في شركة.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>فهم الأنظمة المعقدة:</strong> في الشركات، سترى عمليًا البنى المعقدة وتعمل عليها. إحدى المهارات التي تحتاج إلى تطويرها هي تعلم كيفية فهم هذه الأنظمة والتنقل عبر تعقيداتها.</li>
  <li><strong>التطوير المستمر والتكامل المستمر (CI/CD):</strong> تسعى جميع الشركات إلى إنجاز المزيد من الشيفرة وإصدارها بأكبر قدر ممكن من الكفاءة. لذا، فإن فهم هذين المفهومين مهم جدًا.</li>
  <li><strong>المراقبة والأداء (Monitoring and Performance):</strong> هنا ستتعلم كيفية تتبع المقاييس المهمة لخدماتك وكيفية مراقبة حركة المرور عليها بكفاءة.</li>
  <li><strong>كتابة التوثيق (Documentation):</strong> كمطور برمجيات يعمل على العديد من الخدمات المختلفة، يجب أن تكون قادرًا على كتابة وثائق واضحة وموجزة لنفسك وللآخرين.</li>
</ul>

<p>وهذا كل شيء. آمل أن تكونوا قد استمتعتم بهذا المقال ووجدتموه مفيدًا.</p>

            <h3 style="text-align: left;"><b>TL;DR:</b></h3><p>Effective August 1st, 2025, the PSF is temporarily pausing our Grants Program after reaching our 2025 grant budget cap earlier than expected. We know how important this program is to many in our community and making this decision was difficult. This is a necessary step to protect both the future of the program and the short- and long-term sustainability of the PSF. (If this moves you immediately to donate to the PSF, we welcome your contributions via <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/donations/" target="_blank">our donations page</a>).</p><p></p><h3 style="text-align: left;">The PSF Grants Program is paused</h3><p>As <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/12/psf-grants-program-charter-updates-tldr.html" target="_blank">we shared in December 2024</a> (specifically, <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/12/12psf-grants-program-charter-updates-part-3.html" target="_blank">part 3</a>), the PSF implemented changes to the Grants Program in March 2025 in an effort to ensure the sustainability of the program and the foundation. PSF Staff have been checking in quarterly on our award expenditure, and at the end of Q1, we were on track. When PSF Staff reviewed approved grant awards at the end of Q2, however, we had granted close to 80% of the 2025 grant budget. The grant applications received so far through July exceed the budget ceiling.&nbsp;<br /><br />What does this mean? <b>The PSF Board has voted to implement a pause, effective August 1st, 2025, on the PSF Grants Program.</b> The PSF Board and Staff explored our options thoroughly before coming to this tough, and frankly painful, decision as we deeply understand how important the grants program is to the Python community.&nbsp;<br /><br />Everyone at the PSF is constantly amazed and impressed with the creativity, drive, and ingenuity of the Python community. Supporting the community’s success with our Grants Program is at the heart of our mission—and it brings so much joy to the PSF Board, our small but mighty team of staff, and the wonderful folks in our Work Groups. We are heartbroken to have to pause that work and we know this will be challenging and create more difficult decisions in turn for the many community groups that had planned to apply for the grants program.&nbsp;<br /><br />We will be distributing the small amount of remaining funds in the 2025 PSF Grants Program budget. To honor the time and energy spent on applications already submitted and in the spirit of equity, <b>any applications that were received before August 1st, 2025 will be granted a uniform percentage of the award amount for which they are eligible.</b> If you have a grant application in the system, you will receive an email from us soon with more information. Please send any urgent inquiries to grants@python.org.<br /><br />The PSF aims to be as transparent as possible, and we want to have two-way conversations with the community about this change. We are holding an additional <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/02/introducing-psf-grants-office-hours.html" target="_blank">PSF Grants Program Office Hour</a> in August on the <a href="https://discord.gg/7rthGF3BBe" target="_blank">PSF Discord</a>. We welcome folks to join both or either session:<br /></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>August 13th, 8-9 pm UTC</li><li>August 19th, 1-2 pm UTC</li></ul><p>We also welcome your feedback, particularly how we can support you during this pause, via email to grants@python.org or on the <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/the-psf-has-paused-our-grants-program/101288" target="_blank">thread we’ve started on discuss.python.org</a>.<br /></p><h3 style="text-align: left;">How we got here&nbsp;</h3><div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: left;">Since announcing Grants program changes in December 2024, grant requests
 have grown about 40% over last year. It’s wonderful to see long-time 
events continue to grow. It’s been equally inspiring to see events being
 revived as we move further from 2020 and the start of the COVID 
pandemic, alongside brand-new initiatives from new and seasoned 
organizers. The PSF <b>loves</b> seeing the growth, but the heart of the
 issue is that Python and its community continue to grow exponentially, 
while our funding has not kept pace, and in fact, has decreased.<br /><br />With Python being the <a href="https://github.blog/news-insights/octoverse/octoverse-2024/" target="_blank">number one language on GitHub</a> and <a href="https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/" target="_blank">rising steadily on the TIOBE index</a>,
 it’s no surprise that our community continues to build and grow as 
well. You can see the TIOBE 
index shows what the growth of Python looks like over the years, and how
 much it’s grown in just the past year:<br />&nbsp;</div><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEht7GZUmYfp6B2461-DVgvVlWa5wo2t7n-p5ZOhwU6JHpLM6Nvisw7UHelNjU2P408QYUPGT0amf_zxq9q6Z8b6n0DO7tK86RPkxUQbg7puBF1cWPV3cUMbLkQgESH27-IhezznZd3HAHx6twIQ8psDLoSNZZh0I9mcB0jriqZiadlo3QTaYQ/s2953/python_tiobe.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="244" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEht7GZUmYfp6B2461-DVgvVlWa5wo2t7n-p5ZOhwU6JHpLM6Nvisw7UHelNjU2P408QYUPGT0amf_zxq9q6Z8b6n0DO7tK86RPkxUQbg7puBF1cWPV3cUMbLkQgESH27-IhezznZd3HAHx6twIQ8psDLoSNZZh0I9mcB0jriqZiadlo3QTaYQ/w400-h244/python_tiobe.png" width="400" /></a></div><p>By contrast, the PSF’s available resources have decreased over the last three years and are projected to decrease again in 2025 due to increasing PyCon US and foundation costs. Much of the growth shown before 2022 in the chart below comes from grants we received that were restricted funds dedicated to specific staffing and other programs. The result is increasing global community activity against a decreasing pool of available funds.&nbsp;</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiiH_a89NPF5ydqQMcvx1HaZmdKCIeGc-OX4wf23Fwirp9wqD5QSxY414NJUJW3mH9UUP6CzgkU65mrVOhDHamy5aZXJp8_b1QW0m5OkHNVknnJAQ1OXnWA0i7soEK36os6920emjp5xPGcSHlTIxKSYC09fl_LDjxXQWC8-_yzQ7vH41Gw3w/s782/psf_asset_trends.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="640" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiiH_a89NPF5ydqQMcvx1HaZmdKCIeGc-OX4wf23Fwirp9wqD5QSxY414NJUJW3mH9UUP6CzgkU65mrVOhDHamy5aZXJp8_b1QW0m5OkHNVknnJAQ1OXnWA0i7soEK36os6920emjp5xPGcSHlTIxKSYC09fl_LDjxXQWC8-_yzQ7vH41Gw3w/w464-h640/psf_asset_trends.png" width="464" /></a></div><p></p>For example, 2023 year-end assets were $5.5M with total grants awarded

that negatively impacted our assets, a trend that is not sustainable

 <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/12/12psf-grants-program-charter-updates-part-3.html" target="_blank">PSF Grants Program adjustments implemented earlier this year</a> aimed to 
reduce total grant award spending while providing a more equitable 
approach, but the growth in new/revived grant applications outpaced the 
lowered caps and other limits. As we reviewed Q2 spending, it became 
clear that the unexpected influx of qualified grant proposals had 
already almost exhausted the total amount we had budgeted for the full 
year.&nbsp;<br /><br /></p><p></p><h3 style="text-align: left;">We’re in this together</h3><p>The
 PSF is in a similar position to the many other organizations and NGOs 
(and all of our volunteer conference and meetup organizers!) trying to 
support the Python community and foundation while faced with inflation, 
lower sponsorship, economic pressure in the tech sector, and 
global/local uncertainty and conflict.&nbsp;<br /><br />Last year, <a href="https://pycon.blogspot.com/2024/11/important-changes-ahead-commitment-to.html" target="_blank">the PyCon US blog explained</a> that PyCon US 2024 generated a significant loss; losses 
from PyCon US are paid for by PSF general funds that are also the 
financial source for the PSF Grants programs. For many years, PyCon US 
created a surplus used to fund Grants, PSF staff, and other programs. 
Based on the current numbers for PyCon US 2025, the PSF will need to 
fund another loss. Many factors including the lower-than-budgeted 
attendance, higher location costs, and the current economic and 
political situation contributed to the loss despite incredible efforts 
by staff and volunteers to control costs.&nbsp;<br /></p><h3 style="text-align: left;">What’s the solution?</h3><p>In
 an ideal world, we wouldn’t need to pause the Grants Program and would 
instead be granting even MORE awards to our inspiring community. And 
while that’s not currently the case, we do think you can help us unpause
 the grants program and fund the PSF’s other work. <b>The PSF needs more 
support and resources from the corporations that are built on and making
 revenue from Python. As a community, let’s ask corporations to step up 
and sustain the health of the community and programming language they 
rely on.</b> The AI sector, for example, relies heavily on Python and is 
mostly <a href="https://georgiker.com/blog/is-ai-leaving-python-community-behind/" target="_blank">untapped for the PSF, PyCon US, and our entire community</a>. If you 
have potential sponsorship connections (in AI or otherwise) we welcome 
you to send us leads or connect us via sponsors@python.org.&nbsp;<br /><br />The 
PSF is ever grateful for our sponsors, past and current, and we do 
everything we can to make their sponsorships beneficial and rewarding. 
PSF Staff also work hard to make those sponsorship dollars stretch as 
far as they can. Frankly, the PSF simply needs more sponsorship to 
continue to support the astonishing growth of Python and its community.<br /><br />The
 PSF is also incredibly grateful for our individual donors and PSF 
members. We truly couldn’t do this without you. If you’re inspired to 
help because of this post, we urge you to ask your employers to sponsor 
the PSF. Send them the <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/sponsorship/" target="_blank">PSF’s sponsorship page</a>! We know times are 
financially challenging for everyone, but if you’re feeling very 
inspired and in a position to donate, we welcome your contributions via 
the <a href="https://psfmember.org/civicrm/contribute/transact/?reset=1&amp;id=2" target="_blank">PSF’s donation page</a>. You can also join us as a <a href="https://psfmember.org/python-software-foundation-supporting-member-2/" target="_blank">PSF Supporting Member</a>
 (<a href="https://psfmember.org/civicrm/contribute/transact/?reset=1&amp;id=39" target="_blank">a sliding scale is also available!</a>), to invest in the future of Python
 and its community.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Some additional context</h3><p>As PSF Staff reviewed the Q2 numbers for the Grants Program, we found the following:<br /></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li><b>Revived events. </b>10
 out of the 75 (or about 13%) grants applications we’ve received in 2025
 are for “revived” grant applications for events that weren’t run in 
2024 (including one that hasn’t been run since 2015, whoa!).</li><li><b>Net new applications. </b>19
 out of the 75 (or about 25%) grant applications we’ve received in 2025 
are for totally new events and initiatives. While we did expect some 
growth, this is tremendous!</li><li><b>Earlier applications.</b> We 
encouraged folks to apply earlier—and you did, thank you! We weren’t 
expecting this level of awarding by mid-year. We also expect that to 
continue, so we can now plan better for that in the future.</li><li><b>Higher $$ requests.</b> Across all returning applications the amount being requested is about 13% higher than in years previous.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>While
 we expected more interest from the community in the PSF grants program,
 the amount of growth far exceeded our expectations.&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">What’s next?</h3><p>The
 PSF is working on our strategy to balance support for the worldwide 
Python community and funding constraints, now and in the future. The 
unknown and rapidly growing number of new Python events and 
initiatives—combined with the ongoing needs of existing events and 
organizations that have historically relied on the PSF Grants Program—is
 challenging to manage sustainably on a rolling application basis.<br /><br />So, here’s our plan:<br /></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>First, the PSF Board will continue to refine the grant program’s guiding principles and how they translate into program policy.&nbsp;</li><li>From
 there, PSF Staff will research, plan, and implement a quarterly review 
and awarding approach for the PSF Grants Program to provide an equitable
 and financially sustainable process.</li></ul><p>Moving to a quarterly 
review process from the rolling approval process the Grants Program 
currently uses will be a big change! We will do our best to implement 
processes that work well for the community, the Grants Workgroup, and 
PSF Staff.&nbsp;</p><p>Even with our best efforts, we acknowledge that there will be
 learning opportunities around moving to a quarterly review and most 
likely a series of adjustments ahead of us to get things working 
smoothly. Your feedback as grant applicants and recipients will be 
extremely helpful as we take on this journey. During this process, we 
will determine on what timeline we can re-open the Grants Program. You 
can expect updates from us on the future of the PSF Grants Program in 
early 2026.</p>

            <p><a href="https://nookipedia.com/wiki/Animal_Crossing">Animal Crossing</a> for the GameCube was a game far ahead of its
time and one of my personal favorites growing up. One of the
most beloved features was the addition of playable <a href="https://nookipedia.com/wiki/NES_game">NES games</a>
as rare collectible furniture items.</p>

<p>This feature was implemented by including NES and FDS emulators
and the actual game ROMs on the Animal Crossing disk.
The NES emulator included
with Animal Crossing is frequently referenced as being one of the
most accurate NES emulators available, but comes with the requirement
of playing or emulating a GameCube to access the feature.</p>

<p>What if
you wanted to play these ROMs on a different emulator without having
to jump into your Animal Crossing town, is that possible?</p>

<h2>What game ROMs are available?</h2>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-6">
<p>There are <strong>21 total
NES and Famicom Disk System (FDS) ROMs</strong> across the first generation of Animal
Crossing games. Different games are included <a href="https://nookipedia.com/wiki/NES_game">depending on the
edition of the game</a> (Doubutsu no Mori, Doubutsu no Mori+, Animal Crossing, or Doubutsu no Mori e+)
with <strong>Animal Crossing containing the most unique games at 19</strong>.
Different ROMs are sometimes used <a href="https://nookipedia.com/wiki/NES_game#ROMs">depending on the game's region</a>.</p>

<p>I've included a full list of games available along with two
other data columns. The first being the "loose" game price from <a href="https://www.pricecharting.com/">Pricecharting</a>
at the time of publication. Buying physical copies of
all the games included in Animal Crossing
<strong>costs just over $500 USD!</strong></p>

<p>The second column is whether the game is available as a part of

<h2>Extracting the ROMs</h2>

<p>So if we've archived the Animal Crossing ROM from the physical disk using
CleanRip or the FlippyDrive backup tool,
what can we do to extract the NES and FDS ROM files?</p>

<p>When I went looking for answers, originally I tried tracking
down the exact offsets within the Animal Crossing ROM
using the <a href="https://github.com/ACreTeam/ac-decomp">Animal Crossing decompilation project</a>
as a reference. This turned out to be unnecessary, as I discovered
that the ROM data was likely compressed.</p>

<p>Knowing that the ROM data was compressed, on a hunch I checked
the ROM for all Yaz0-compressed blobs. Yaz0 is commonly used by
Nintendo for compressing assets. Sure enough, the ROMs were all
compressed using Yaz0 which uses a highly identifiable magic string
of "<code>Yaz0</code>".
This meant we could extract all ROM files by decompressing all
Yaz0 blobs and then look for NES and FDS ROM headers.</p>

<p>Below is the entire script I used to archive the NES ROMs from the
Animal Crossing ISO, including an implementation of the <a href="http://www.amnoid.de/gc/yaz0.txt">Yaz0</a>
compression scheme:</p>

<p>This script can be improved by adding more MD5 checksums of ROMs from different regions like Japan and the EU.
Currently I've only tested using the North American copy of Animal Crossing.</p>

<p>These ROMs can now be used just like any other ROM with NES emulators. If you're
playing on desktop and want to try your ROMs out you can use <a href="https://koute.github.io/pinky-web/">Pinky</a>, a WASM-based
NES emulator. If you want to play on mobile I recommend using the <a href="https://delta-emu.com/">Delta emulator</a>.</p>

<p>It feels quite magical to be playing NES games from a childhood copy of Animal Crossing
on a modern iPhone. Wario's Woods was always my favorite, so I look forward to playing
the game more often and keeping that nostalgic connection alive.</p>

<p>If you're looking for more ways to find legal ROMs of games, WULFF DEN <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQNXmOidh1g">published
a video</a> recently linking to a
<a href="https://github.com/farmerbb/RED-Project/wiki#game-compilations">list of other "ROM extraction" methods</a> like this one.</p>

<h2>What if I only have a Game Boy Advance?</h2>

<p>You're in luck! Animal Crossing also had a feature called
"<a href="https://nookipedia.com/wiki/Game_Boy_Advance#Advance_Play">Advance Play</a>"
which meant most NES games could be saved to your GBA via a mode called
"Multiboot" or "Joyboot". Animal Crossing used separate
ROMs that were compiled for the GBA CPU instead of the NES CPU.</p>

<p>These ROMs are detected by looking for the string <code>AGBJ01\x96</code> at offset <code>0xAC</code>, corresponding
to the Game Boy Advance ROM header that was chosen for these ROMs.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> To run these on a GBA emulator or with a GBA flash cartridge you need to
  convert the <code>.mb</code> files into <code>.gba</code> files. <a href="https://gist.github.com/mid-kid/149e7415e5da89cca5e2dd36459eeac5">This script</a> worked for
  converting the files to <code>.gba</code>.</p>

<li><p>patch allows coverage to run better when a covered project uses</p>

<li>os._exit()</li>
<li>execv family of functions</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Looking at subprocess</p>

<ul>
<li>“Coverage works great when you start your program with coverage measurement, but has long had the problem of how to also measure the coverage of sub-processes that your program created. The existing solution had been a complicated two-step process of creating obscure .pth files and setting environment variables. Whole projects appeared on PyPI to handle this for you.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>From release notes</p>

<p>for 7.10.0</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A new configuration option: “[run] patch” specifies named patches to work around some limitations in coverage measurement. These patches are available:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>patch = _exit</code> lets coverage save its data even when <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os._exit"><strong>&lt;code>os._exit()&lt;/code></strong></a> is used to abruptly end the process. This closes long-standing <a href="https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/310?featured_on=pythonbytes">issue 310</a> as well as its duplicates: <a href="https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/312?featured_on=pythonbytes">issue 312</a>, <a href="https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1673?featured_on=pythonbytes">issue 1673</a>, <a href="https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1845?featured_on=pythonbytes">issue 1845</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1941?featured_on=pythonbytes">issue 1941</a>.</li>
<li><code>patch = subprocess</code> measures coverage in Python subprocesses created with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#module-subprocess"><strong>&lt;code>subprocess&lt;/code></strong></a>, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.system"><strong>&lt;code>os.system()&lt;/code></strong></a>, or one of the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.execl"><strong>&lt;code>execv&lt;/code></strong></a> or <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.spawnl"><strong>&lt;code>spawnv&lt;/code></strong></a> family of functions.

<li><code>patch = execv</code> adjusts the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.execl"><strong>&lt;code>execv&lt;/code></strong></a> family of functions to save coverage data before ending the current program and starting the next. Not available on Windows. Closes <a href="https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/43?featured_on=pythonbytes">issue 43</a> after 15 years!</li>

          <p class="text-base-content">
            <p>You probably know that I love Rust and TypeScript, and I&#8217;m a big proponent of
good typing systems.  One of the reasons I find them useful is that they enable
autocomplete, which is generally a good feature.  Having a well-integrated type
system that makes sense and gives you optimization potential for memory layouts
is generally a good idea.</p>
<p>From that, you&#8217;d naturally think this would also be great for agentic coding
tools.  There&#8217;s clearly some benefit to it.  If you have an agent write
TypeScript and the agent adds types, it performs well.  I don&#8217;t know if it
outperforms raw JavaScript, but at the very least it doesn&#8217;t seem to do any
harm.</p>
<p>But most agentic tools don&#8217;t have access to an LSP (language server protocol).
My experiments with agentic coding tools that do have LSP access (with type
information available) haven&#8217;t meaningfully benefited from it.  The LSP
protocol slows things down and pollutes the context significantly.  Also, the
models haven&#8217;t been trained sufficiently to understand how to work with this
information.  Just getting a type check failure from the compiler in text
form yields better results.</p>
<p>What you end up with is an agent coding loop that, without type checks enabled,
results in the agent making forward progress by writing code and putting types
somewhere.  As long as this compiles to some version of JavaScript (if you use
Bun, much of it ends up type-erased), it creates working code.  And from there
it continues.  But that&#8217;s bad progress—it&#8217;s the type of progress where it
needs to come back after and clean up the types.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s curious because types are obviously being written but they&#8217;re largely
being ignored.  If you do put the type check into the loop, my tests actually
showed worse performance.  That&#8217;s because the agent manages to get the code
running, and only after it&#8217;s done does it run the type check.  Only then, maybe
at a much later point, does it realize it made type errors.  Then it starts
fixing them, maybe goes in a loop, and wastes a ton of context.  If you make it
do the type checks after every single edit, you end up eating even more into the
context.</p>
<p>This gets really bad when the types themselves are incredibly complicated and
non-obvious.  TypeScript has arcane expression functionality, and some
libraries go overboard with complex constructs (e.g., <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/conditional-types.html">conditional
types</a>).
LLMs have little clue how to read any of this.  For instance, if you give it
access to the .d.ts files from TanStack Router and the forward declaration
stuff it uses for the router system to work properly, it doesn&#8217;t understand any
of it.  It guesses, and sometimes guesses badly.  It&#8217;s utterly confused.  When
it runs into type errors, it performs all kinds of manipulations, none of which
are helpful.</p>
<p>Python typing has an even worse problem, because there we have to work with a
very complicated ecosystem where different type checkers cannot even agree on
how type checking should work.  That means that the LLM, at least from my
testing, is not even fully capable of understanding how to resolve type check
errors from tools which are not from mypy.  It&#8217;s not universally bad, but if
you actually end up with a complex type checking error that you cannot resolve
yourself, it is shocking how the LLM is also often not able to fully figure out
what&#8217;s going on, or at least needs multiple attempts.</p>
<p>As a shining example of types adding a lot of value we have Go.  Go&#8217;s types are
much less expressive and very structural.  Things conform to interfaces purely
by having certain methods.  The LLM does not need to understand much to
comprehend that.  Also, the types that Go has are rather strictly enforced.  If
they are wrong, it won&#8217;t compile.  Because Go has a much simpler type system
that doesn&#8217;t support complicated constructs, it works much better—both for LLMs
to understand the code they produce and for the LLM to understand real-world
libraries you might give to an LLM. </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t really know what to do with this, but these behaviors suggest there&#8217;s
a lot more value in best-effort type systems or type hints like JSDoc.  Because
at least as far as the LLM is concerned, it doesn&#8217;t need to fully understand
the types, it just needs to have a rough understanding of what type some object
probably is.  For the LLM it&#8217;s more important that the type name in the error

<p>I think it&#8217;s an interesting question whether this behavior of LLMs today will
influence future language design.  I don&#8217;t know if it will, but I think it
gives a lot of credence to some of the decisions that led to languages like Go
and Java.  As critical as I have been in the past about their rather simple
approaches to problems and having a design that maybe doesn&#8217;t hold developers
in a particularly high regard, I now think that they actually are measurably in
a very good spot.  There is more elegance to their design than I gave it
credit for.</p>

<p>Quand j’ai commencé mon parcours en tant qu’indépendant, mon objectif était limpide : <strong>donner des formations sur <a href="https://www.python.org">Python</a></strong>. Expliquer comment l’utiliser, comment le comprendre, le structurer, le manipuler. Bref, <strong>transmettre avec passion</strong> tout ce que j’avais appris au fil des années.</p>
<p>À cette époque, Python 2 était encore bien présent, mais <strong>Python 3 commençait à faire doucement son chemin</strong>. En 2014, on utilisait la version 3.4, et dès 2015, la 3.5 était disponible.</p>
