            <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerability_Scoring_System">CVSS</a> is a scoring system for the severity of a software vulnerability.
The scores range from 0 to 10, but that doesn't mean it's a “10-point system”.
A single value after a decimal (“8.7”) is allowed too, meaning there are 100 potential CVSS scores.
<strong>But what if we need more precision?</strong></p>

That's not surprising, there's no conference without talks! Over the years, though, I came to appreciate the so-called hallway track and the usual post-conference sprints that many events include. These days, I mostly come for those. Let's talk about why.</span></p></span><h2 style="text-align: left;">Raw numbers</h2><span><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.96364; margin-bottom: 12pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="color: #333333; font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline;">Before we get into subjective and soft reasons why sprints are great, just consider how productive they are for Python. To give you an idea, let's focus on three Python conferences of different sizes on three continents.</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.96364; margin-bottom: 12pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="color: #333333; font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline;">At PyCon US 2025, 370 new PRs were open to the Python organization during, 286 to the </span><span>cpython</span><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="color: #333333; font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline;"> repository alone. Close to 300 PRs were merged into the Python GitHub organization during that time. That's for four days of sprints. This is over 2X the number of PRs handled during the same period when there's no sprint happening.</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.96364; margin-bottom: 12pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="color: #333333; font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline;">There's been two days of sprints at EuroPython in Prague this year, but they didn't disappoint either: 122 new PRs open to the Python organization, including 99 to the </span><span>cpython</span><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="color: #333333; font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline;"> repository. 79 PRs were merged into the Python GitHub organization during this time. This is 1.75X the number of PRs handled during a typical weekend.</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.96364; margin-bottom: 12pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="color: #333333; font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline;">Even single-day sprint days at conferences are pretty productive. At PyCon Korea earlier this August the attendees managed to open 59 new PRs to the Python organization, including 35 PRs to the </span><span>cpython</span><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="color: #333333; font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline;"> repository. Over 40 PRs were merged into the Python organization that day. Still 1.7X the typical velocity.</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.96364; margin-bottom: 12pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="color: #333333; font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline;">Hopefully, you're seeing what I'm seeing: sprints can provide a measurable boost to an open-source project. The longer the sprints are, the bigger this boost is. This is because many contributions need more than a day to bake, some bugs can be pretty stubborn, and many features uncover surprising depth once you start implementing them.</span></p></span><h2 style="text-align: left;">Momentum</h2><span><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.96364; margin-bottom: 12pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="color: #333333; font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline;">There's something magical about a large group of people banding together to attack problems. While this is what open source is in general, adding together physical presence in the same physical space at the same time is the secret sauce. Real-time coordination really is more efficient. We can guess at reasons for this, but we can safely assume a big part is simply that humans are social animals. It's easier to empathize with a person when they're in the same room with you. In my experience, pointing at a screen still beats Internet communication.</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.96364; margin-bottom: 12pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="color: #333333; font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline;">Part of what makes sprints so productive is that it is a time-boxed period of uninterrupted time away from your usual work environment. And that's true for everyone, so people have the ability to focus on a specific project or problem for an extended period of time. But since there's a time limit to how long the sprints are, there's also some productive pressure to ship something concrete by the end of your stay. So, it's rare to see people playing games or doomscrolling during sprints. Instead, they want to ship something, even if it's a humble small first contribution.</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.96364; margin-bottom: 12pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="color: #333333; font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline;">Better yet, after you spend some time with a person in real life, even online interactions with them afterwards change. My brain does this thing where it reads GitHub comments of people I know in their voice. This little thing additionally humanizes the pixels on screen and makes the interaction smoother. When you come to sprints, you build more lasting connections, because you don't only talk about stuff in the hallway, you're solving problems together.</span></p></span><h2 style="text-align: left;">You're getting for free what you wouldn't be able to buy if you tried</h2><span><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.96364; margin-bottom: 12pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="color: #333333; font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline;">You're solving problems together alongside developers from different companies, backgrounds and specialties. Some of them are maintainers of the projects you're contributing to, with a wealth of expertise they're sharing freely. You get immediate feedback, you can learn at a rate that is impossible to match online. You learn not only by doing and asking questions, but even just by watching others work. You discover better tools or ways to use them you didn't know existed.</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.96364; margin-bottom: 12pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="color: #333333; font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline;">To put it bluntly, the experts you work with during sprints would be impossible to hire as tutors, and here you get to work with them free of charge. Think about it, that alone makes it worth staying for sprints. And don't get cold feet, either, because...</span></p></span><h2 style="text-align: left;">You belong</h2><span><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.96364; margin-bottom: 12pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="color: #333333; font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline;">I've heard some newcomers are worried that maybe the expected experience level is too high. I say you will definitely find something productive to do. I even blogged about this specifically for PyCon US this year, so you can read "</span><a href="https://pycon.blogspot.com/2025/04/pyconus-sprints.html" style="text-decoration: none;"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="color: #4078c0; font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline;">What to Expect at PyCon US Sprints</span></a><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="color: #333333; font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline;">" to get an idea about how to make your experience great. The PyCon Korea sprint organizer and Steering Council member Donghee Na says: "I notice that the participants who had a good experience at last year's sprint tend to rejoin the sprint this year. I hope that many of them come back next year too." I'm seeing the same thing, and want to see even more of it. We do care about your experience.</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.96364; margin-bottom: 12pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="color: #333333; font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline;">Specifically at PyCon US, this year we tried something new. We split the CPython sprint room into two rooms: one dedicated to first-time contributors, and one to seasoned developers that needed to focus on some feature or bugfix they really wanted to ship before leaving Pittsburgh. It turned out great. Talking to attendees on both ends, I think both rooms enjoyed this setup and we will be repeating that for next year. While I was coordinating the first-time contributor room, I was heartened to see that quite a few veteran core developers joined me in the room. It was fun all four days!</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.96364; margin-bottom: 12pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="color: #333333; font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline;">At EuroPython, the setup this year was such that Petr Viktorin and I were coordinating the CPython sprint... or so we thought! In parallel, Adam Turner was leading the CPython documentation sprint, but attendees responded so well to him that he quickly organically became the de facto leader of the entire CPython sprint. Kudos, Adam, you did great!</span></p></span><h2 style="text-align: left;">Dedicated sprint events</h2><span><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.96364; margin-bottom: 12pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="color: #333333; font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline;">It's not all roses with sprints that are attached to conferences. After an intense few days of the larger event, people tend to get tired. Introverts run out of steam. Key people that you could use talking to don't stay or are only available on the first day. If only there could be an event where core developers gather for a week just to sprint.

            <p>In a <a href="https://davidlattimore.github.io/posts/2025/09/02/rustforge-wild-performance-tricks.html">recent article by David
Lattimore</a>,
he demonstrates a number of Rust performance tricks, including one that involve writing code that
looks like a loop, but which in practice is optimized down to a fixed
number of instructions. Having what looks like an <em>O</em>(<em>n</em>) loop turned
into a constant operation is great for speed!</p>

<p>But there’s a problem with this sort of trick: how do you know the
compiler will <em>keep</em> doing it? What happens when the compiler’s next
release comes out? How can you catch performance regressions?</p>

<p>One solution is benchmarking: you measure your code’s speed, and if it
gets a lot slower, something has gone wrong. This is useful and
important if you care about speed. But it’s also less localized, so it
won’t necessarily immediately pinpoint where the regression happened.</p>

<p>In this article I’m going to cover another approach: a test that will
only pass if the compiler really did optimize the loop away.</p>

        <p><strong><code>Ctrl+A</code></strong> does not work in the usual Windows Command Prompt or Powershell (it selects all text instead) <em>unless</em> they are run within the new Windows 10 Terminal app.</p>

      
        <p>On Linux and Mac, <code>Ctrl+D</code> can be used to exit the REPL, but on Windows you'll need to press <code>Ctrl+Z</code> and then press <code>Enter</code> afterward (to submit).
Using <code>Ctrl+D</code> on Linux/Mac or <code>Ctrl+Z</code> and <code>Enter</code> on Windows only works when the shortcut is pressed at a blank prompt.</p>

      
        <p>Note that the above shortcuts assume you are working in the new Python REPL (3.13+).</p>

      
        <p>On Python 3.12 the only shortcuts above that worked on Windows are:</p>

      
        <ul>
<li><code>Left</code> and <code>Right</code> for navigating characters</li>
<li><code>Up</code> and <code>Down</code> for navigating line-by-line history</li>
<li><code>Ctrl+Z</code> <code>Enter</code> for exiting</li>
<li><code>Ctrl+Left</code> and <code>Ctrl+Right</code> for navigating words</li>
</ul>

      
        <p>Most of those shortcuts also worked on Python 3.12 on Linux and Mac except:</p>

      
        <ul>
<li><code>Up</code> and <code>Down</code> only navigated line-by-line history</li>
<li><code>Alt+Enter</code> did nothing</li>
<li><code>F2</code> and <code>F3</code> did nothing because these modes were added in the new REPL</li>
<li>Some shortcuts (like <code>Ctrl+U</code>) may differ slightly in their abilities</li>
</ul>

            <p>In July, I joined <a href="https://mastodon.social/@raffaellasuardini">Raffaella Suardini</a> and <a href="https://laymonage.com/">Sage Abdullah</a> for the Djangonaut Space <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuehKySWKxc">Space Reviewers Episode 6</a>, where we reviewed a Django PR during a live stream. This was a fun event. I won’t get into the technical aspects of the review, and I won’t point out the many mistakes I made. Instead, I want to revisit several “getting started with open source” community events and reflect on my personal growth since I first got involved with open source.</p>
<p>I hope this encourages others to attend those events and similarly get involved!</p>
<hr />
<h4 id="s-tutorial-office-hours">Tutorial office hours 🕐</h4>
<p>My first open source contribution happened accidentally during DjangoCon US 2023. I volunteered to host office hours to help tutorial attendees set up their development environments. I went through the tutorial projects, found a missing dependency in one of them, and reported it on the conference chat. A conference organizer, <a href="https://www.better-simple.com/">Tim Schilling</a>, responded and suggested that I open a pull request (PR) to the project. I remember thinking to myself, <em>“Really? I can do that?”</em>.</p>
<h4 id="s-sprints">Sprints 🏃</h4>
<p>During the Sprint Days of the conference, I participated and opened two PRs to address accessibility issues. I didn’t know much about accessibility at that point, and I would not have known how to navigate the contribution process and pick out issues on my own. Thankfully, the project leaders were there to guide new contributors, and I was able to gain hands-on experience with these first few PRs.</p>
<h4 id="s-testathons">Testathons 🧪</h4>
<p>There was another event that took place during the Sprint Days called Testathon. I had heard of hackathons before, but I had not heard of testathons. I attended and found out they were like live stream coding or group pair programming. One person shared their screen and the group chimed in on strategies. The purpose of the testathon was to show people how to test open source projects against Django’s beta release. The code driver (or anyone else in the group) would point out what files to look for, how to run tests, and how to open PRs. Every project is slightly different, from project setup to contributing etiquette, and I learned several different things from attending 2 testathons. I loved the interactive and intimate nature of the event. It exposed me to another aspect of open source projects and contributions. I also thought it was very brave of people to share their screens and work through code together in a group. My brain would have short circuited if I were put on the spot like that!</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>From DjangoCon US 2023, I participated in 3 different types of events where I got hands-on experience with open source contributions, and I wanted more! I was curious about the live stream coding and group pair programming opportunities, too. This was definitely outside of my comfort zone, and I wanted to know how I could overcome my own inhibitions and participate more actively. I wanted to be able to jump into events so nonchalantly as everyone else seemed to do. (Of course, that’s the perception. Now, I know that most people feel some level of nervousness or anxiety when they are hosting or attending such events, and that’s absolutely normal.)</p>
<h4 id="s-djangonaut-space">Djangonaut Space 🚀</h4>
<p>When the <a href="https://djangonaut.space/">Djangonaut Space</a> program was announced, I jumped at the opportunity. I applied and was accepted for the first session, which took place from mid-January to early March of 2024. With the guidance of the Navigator and Captain on my team, I learned to sift through the Django’s Trac ticket management system, pick out a ticket, and I also faced my fear of posting comments publicly. The PR was merged, and it was thrilling to see my GitHub username in the history of the Django code base.</p>
<p>In March 2024, when the first Djangonaut Space session came to a close, Tim, a program organizer, asked if anyone was interested in hosting a “Getting Started With Contributing” event. I expressed my interest, and Tim suggested a ticket to work on. Unfortunately, I didn’t follow through. How could I host a “Getting Started With Contributing” event? First, I wasn’t sure if I even knew how to get started. Second, I wasn’t ready to lead an event and the discussions while simultaneously sharing my screen and thinking out loud. Finally, I wasn’t ready to be on camera in the public eye. Even though I had just finished the Djangonaut Space program, I hadn’t overcome my own inhibitions. I didn’t ask for guidance, and the event never materialized.</p>
<h4 id="s-space-reviewers">Space Reviewers 👾</h4>
<p>About 8 months later in November 2024, Space Reviewers launched its very first episode. I thought it was such a creative format. I wanted to be a part of it. By this time, I was getting a lot of training with event organizing through my role as the Session Organizer for Djangonaut Space, but I wasn’t sure how to ask about joining the Space Reviewers crew, and maybe it was too early in the formation of the group to bring on another member.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until June 2025 that I finally asked if I could help out with Space Reviewers. The crew welcomed me as a new member. I started out by making a pre-recorded video, a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPndbdezvJw">PR Review Deep Dive</a>, that was uploaded to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@djangonautspace">Djangonaut Space YouTube channel</a>. I had a lot of fun recording and editing the video.</p>
<p>A month later, in July 2025, the crew members planned for the next episode. Raffaella scheduled time for the event and created the show notes, and I was taking on Tim’s role as a co-organizer. Because I would be managing the video stream and sharing my screen, I realized that I could be the single point of failure during the event. There was no safety element that a pre-recorded video offers. If my internet went down, or if my computer crashed, or if I stupidly clicked the wrong button, the live stream could come to a halt. It was a terrifying thought, but I took on the risks and pushed forward.</p>
<p>On the day of the event, there was a delay to the start time and some fumbles on my end, but overall, it was very fun and productive. People joined and shared their tips and tricks in the live chat. By the end, we were able to walk through the review process and post our comments on the PR. Looking back, I think making the pre-recorded video was a great stepping stone towards hosting the live stream.</p>
<p>I’m so glad I had the opportunity to work with Raffaella and Sage as part of Space Reviewers. They have a lot of insights and perspectives that I didn’t have. I had a lot of fun taking on the new challenges that came with organizing this event. Initially, I struggled internally as I tried to face some of my fears. There were moments leading up to the event where I thought to myself, “Why did I volunteer to do this???” In the end, I’m glad I did.</p>
<h4 id="s-personal-growth">Personal growth 🌱</h4>
<p>Some of the challenges I overcame might not seem like a big deal, but when I compare myself to where I was at the beginning of DjangoCon US 2023, I can see my personal growth quite prominently. Now, I know how to get started with contributing, and I am able to walk people through the process. I am also a lot more comfortable taking ownership of organizing and leading events. (I remember a time when I constantly needed to ask for permission or confirmation before executing an action.) I can brush off the fumbles I make as the camera is rolling, and I can continue on with the discussion.</p>
<p>When I revisit the community events that I have participated in over the past 2 years, from Space Reviewers, to Sprints, to Testathons, to Tutorial office hours, I realize how far I have come. I am also reminded of what it was like to be absolutely new to open source and to the community. Although I still feel somewhat new, I’m not a deer in headlights anymore. I’m still trying to find my place in open source, and the best way to do that is to continue showing up and continue helping out. One small PR at a time, one small review at a time. One little blog, one little video…</p>

            <p>Wing Python IDE version 11.0.4 has been released.  It adds debugger and code analysis
support for Python 3.14, improves Python code analysis and code warnings, and makes
a number of other minor improvements.</p>
<img alt="Wing 11 Screen Shot" class="eye-candy-image unfloat-at-900" src="https://wingware.com/images/screenshots/wing11-screenshot.png" width="650px" /><h3>Downloads</h3><div class="note">
Be sure to <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Check</span> <span class="pre">for</span> <span class="pre">Updates</span></tt> in Wing's <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Help</span></tt> menu after downloading, to make
sure that you have the latest hot fixes.</div>

<p><a class="reference" href="/downloads/wing-101/11.0.4.0">Wing 101 11.0.4</a></p>
<p>Wing 10 and earlier versions are not affected by installation of Wing 11 and
may be installed and used independently. However, project files for Wing 10
and earlier are converted when opened by Wing 11 and should be saved under a
new name, since Wing 11 projects cannot be opened by older versions of Wing.</p>
<h2><img src="https://wingware.com/images/wing18.png" /> New in Wing 11</h2><h3>Improved AI Assisted Development</h3><p>Wing 11 improves the user interface for AI assisted development by introducing two separate
tools <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span> <span class="pre">Coder</span></tt> and <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span> <span class="pre">Chat</span></tt>. <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span> <span class="pre">Coder</span></tt> can be used to write, redesign, or extend code
in the current editor. <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span> <span class="pre">Chat</span></tt> can be used to ask about code or iterate in creating a
design or new code without directly modifying the code in an editor.</p>
<p>Wing 11's AI assisted development features now support not just OpenAI but also Claude, Grok,
Gemini, Perplexity, Mistral, Deepseek, and any other OpenAI completions API compatible AI provider.</p>
<p>This release also improves setting up AI request context, so that both automatically and
manually selected and described context items may be paired with an AI request. AI request
contexts can now be stored, optionally so they are shared by all projects, and may be used
independently with different AI features.</p>
<p>AI requests can now also be stored in the current project or shared with all projects, and Wing
comes preconfigured with a set of commonly used requests. In addition to changing code in the
current editor, stored requests may create a new untitled file or run instead in AI Chat. Wing
11 also introduces options for changing code within an editor, including replacing code,
commenting out code, or starting a diff/merge session to either accept or reject changes.</p>
<p>Wing 11 also supports using AI to generate commit messages based on the changes being committed
to a revision control system.</p>
<p>You can now also configure multiple AI providers for easier access to different models.</p>
<p>For details see <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span> <span class="pre">Assisted</span> <span class="pre">Development</span></tt> under <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Wing</span> <span class="pre">Manual</span></tt> in Wing 11's <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Help</span></tt> menu.</p>
<h3>Package Management with uv </h3><p>Wing Pro 11 adds support for the <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">uv</span></tt> package manager in the New Project dialog and the
Packages tool.</p>
<p>For details see <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Project</span> <span class="pre">Manager</span> <span class="pre">&gt;</span> <span class="pre">Creating</span> <span class="pre">Projects</span> <span class="pre">&gt;</span> <span class="pre">Creating</span> <span class="pre">Python</span> <span class="pre">Environments</span></tt> and <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Package</span>

<h3>Improved Python Code Analysis</h3><p>Wing 11 makes substantial improvements to Python code analysis, with better support for
literals such as dicts and sets, parametrized type aliases, <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">typing.Self</span></tt>, type of
variables on the <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">def</span></tt> or <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">class</span></tt> line that declares them, generic classes with
<tt class="literal"><span class="pre">[...]</span></tt>, <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">__all__</span></tt> in <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">*.pyi</span></tt> files, subscripts in <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">typing.Type</span></tt> and similar, type
aliases, type hints in strings, <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">type[...]</span></tt> and <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">tuple[...]</span></tt>,
<tt class="literal"><span class="pre">&#64;functools.cached_property</span></tt>, base classes found also in <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">.pyi</span></tt> files, and
<tt class="literal"><span class="pre">typing.Literal[...]</span></tt>.</p>
<h3>Updated Localizations</h3><p>Wing 11 updates the German, French, and Russian localizations, and introduces a new experimental
AI-generated Spanish localization. The Spanish localization and the new AI-generated strings in the
French and Russian localizations may be accessed with the new <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">User</span> <span class="pre">Interface</span> <span class="pre">&gt;</span> <span class="pre">Include</span> <span class="pre">AI</span>
<span class="pre">Translated</span> <span class="pre">Strings</span></tt> preference.</p>
<h3>Improved diff/merge</h3><p>Wing Pro 11 adds floating buttons directly between the editors to make navigating differences
and merging easier, allows undoing previously merged changes, and does a better job managing
scratch buffers, scroll locking, and sizing of merged ranges.</p>
<p>For details see <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Difference</span> <span class="pre">and</span> <span class="pre">Merge</span></tt> under <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Wing</span> <span class="pre">Manual</span></tt> in Wing 11's <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Help</span></tt> menu.</p>
<h3>Other Minor Features and Improvements</h3><p>Wing 11 also adds support for Python 3.14, improves the custom key binding assignment user
interface, adds a <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Files</span> <span class="pre">&gt;</span> <span class="pre">Auto-Save</span> <span class="pre">Files</span> <span class="pre">When</span> <span class="pre">Wing</span> <span class="pre">Loses</span> <span class="pre">Focus</span></tt> preference, warns
immediately when opening a project with an invalid Python Executable configuration, allows
clearing recent menus, expands the set of available special environment variables for
project configuration, and makes a number of other bug fixes and usability improvements.</p>
<h3>Changes and Incompatibilities</h3><p>Since Wing 11 replaced the <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span></tt> tool with <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span> <span class="pre">Coder</span></tt> and <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span> <span class="pre">Chat</span></tt>, and AI
configuration is completely different than in Wing 10, you will need to reconfigure your
AI integration manually in Wing 11. This is done with <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Manage</span> <span class="pre">AI</span> <span class="pre">Providers</span></tt> in the
<tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span></tt> menu. After adding the first provider configuration, Wing will set that provider as
the default. You can switch between providers with <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Switch</span> <span class="pre">to</span> <span class="pre">Provider</span></tt> in the <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span></tt> menu.</p>

<p>This year was extra special: <a href="/weblog/2025/jul/13/happy-20th-birthday-django/">Django’s 20th birthday</a> was right at the beginning of the conference! The milestone was marked in style, starting on Wednesday evening at Pyvo, the local Python community meetup in Prague, where we celebrated with a cake.</p>

<p>On Friday, the celebration continued with an open-space gathering at the conference — and, of course, another cake 🎂. For people who missed this, there are other <a href="https://birthday20.djangoproject.com/">local Django birthday events</a> running through the rest of 2025!</p>

<p>Adding to the festive atmosphere, the DSF shared stickers co-branded with their unofficial pony mascot and the EuroPython and EuroPython Society logos. These became an instant hit with attendees, combining Django’s playful mascot with EuroPython Society’s identity.</p>

<p>The Django community was also active during the sprint weekend. Over two days, 21 participants worked on Django, tackling 12 issues and merging 4 pull requests. For newcomers, it was a welcoming way to start contributing; for experienced developers, it was a chance to share knowledge and push the project forward together.</p>

<p>We asked the members of the Django Software Foundation attending EuroPython how they liked EuroPython and this is what they said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The talks and tutorials were so great and I got to witness amazing projects from this community. This was my first EuroPython conference and let me tell you, this community over-delivered. It was also my first time organizing Django Girls outside Africa. Django Girls Prague was amazing.</p>
<p>– <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/doreennangira/">Doreen Nangira</a> - Django Girls organizer</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Just the perfect mixture of catching up with people I know, meeting people I don’t know, learning new things. Time well spent chatting w/ Python veterans and also first-timers. Volunteering there was ACE, and I’m thankful we got to have a booth and birthday cake for Django 🎂</p>
<p>– <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/thibaudcolas/">Thibaud Colas</a> - President, Django Software Foundation</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It was my first EuroPython, it felt really special! I was surrounded by wonderful people, and it was an amazing experience to volunteer at our community booth.</p>

<p>We’re delighted the DSF joined us this year. If you’re part of a foundation and would like to have a booth at EuroPython, keep an eye out for our Call for Communities next year.</p>
<hr />
<p>Thank you to EuroPython Vice Chair and DSF Individual member <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mia-bajic">Mia Bajić</a> for reporting back on the event ❤️. And thank you to our volunteers Tom Carrick, Thibaud Colas, Raffaella Suardini, and Alex Gómez who represented our foundation at the conference. As well as to Doreen Nangira who ran the Django Girls+ workshop at the conference!</p>

<p>Is it also archived? As in done?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so. I think I might start that up again at some point.</p>
<p>But for now, it&rsquo;s on a long-ish term pause.</p>
<p>BTW, the RSS feeds for both Python People and Test and Code should be redirected correctly, so you shouldn&rsquo;t have to change anything in your podcast player.</p>

            <p>Did you know that Python 3.14 will include <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#whatsnew314-pyrepl-highlighting">syntax highlighting</a> in the REPL?</p>

<p>Python 3.14 is due to be <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0745/">officially released</a> in about a month.
I recommended tweaking your Python setup now so you&rsquo;ll have your ideal color scheme on release day.</p>

<p><img src="https://treyhunner.com/images/python3.14-repl-syntax-highlighting.png" title="Python 3.14 REPL with syntax highlighting using custom color scheme" /></p>

<p>But&hellip; what if the default syntax colors don&rsquo;t match the colors that your text editor uses?</p>

<p>Well, fortunately you can customize your color scheme!</p>

<p><strong>Warning</strong>: I am recommending using an undocumented private module (it has an <code>_</code>-prefixed name) which may change in future Python versions.
Do not use this module in production code.</p>

<h2>Installing Python 3.14</h2>

<p>Don&rsquo;t have Python 3.14 installed yet?</p>

<p>If you have <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/">uv</a> installed, you can run this command to launch Python 3.14:</p>

<figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="bash"><span class="line"><span class="nv">$ </span>uv run --python 3.14 python
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>That will automatically install 3.14 (if you don&rsquo;t have it yet) and run it.</p>

<h2>Setting a theme</h2>

<p>I have my terminal colors set to the Solarized Light color palette and I have Vim use a Solarized Light color scheme as well.</p>

<p>The REPL doesn&rsquo;t <em>quite</em> match my text editor by default:</p>

<p><img src="https://treyhunner.com/images/python3.14-repl-default-color-scheme.png" title="Python 3.14 REPL with default syntax highlighting" /></p>

<p>The numbers, comments, strings, and keywords are all different colors than my text editor.</p>

<p>This code makes the Python REPL use <em>nearly</em> the same syntax highlighting as my text editor:</p>

<h2>Using a <code>PYTHONSTARTUP</code> file</h2>

<p>You can use a <code>PYTHONSTARTUP</code> file to run code every time a new Python process starts.</p>

<p>If Python sees a <code>PYTHONSTARTUP</code> environment variable when it starts up, it will open that file and evaluate the code within it.</p>

<p>I have this in my <code>~/.zshrc</code> file to set the <code>PYTHONSTARTUP</code> environment variable to <code>~/.startup.py</code>:</p>

<p>Note that:</p>

<ol>
<li>I put all relevant code within a <code>_main</code> function so that the variables I set don&rsquo;t remain in the global scope of the Python REPL (they will by default)</li>
<li>I call the <code>_main</code> function and then delete the function afterward, again so the <code>_main</code> variable doesn&rsquo;t stay floating around in my REPL</li>
<li>I use <code>try</code>-<code>except</code>-<code>else</code> to ensure errors don&rsquo;t occur on Python 3.13 and below</li>
</ol>


<p>Also note that the syntax highlighting in the new REPL is <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/134953">not as fine-grained</a> as many other syntax highlighting tools.
I suspect that it may become a bit more granular over time, <strong>which may break the above code</strong>.</p>

<p>The <code>_colorize</code> module is currently an internal implementation detail and is deliberately undocumented.
Its API may change at any time, so <strong>the above code may break in Python 3.15</strong>.
If that happens, I&rsquo;ll just update my <code>PYTHONSTARTUP</code> file at that point.</p>

<h2>Packaging themes</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve stuck all of the above code in a <code>~/.startup.py</code> file and I set the <code>PYTHONSTARTUP</code> environment variable on my system to point to this file.</p>

<p>Instead of manually updating a startup file, is there any way to make these themes <em>installable</em>?</p>

<p>Well, if a <code>.pth</code> file is included in Python&rsquo;s <code>site-packages</code> directory, that file (which must be a single line) will be run whenever Python starts up.
In theory, a package could use such a file to import a module and then call a function that would set the color scheme for the REPL.
My <a href="https://github.com/treyhunner/dramatic">dramatic</a> package uses (<em>cough</em> abuses <em>cough</em>) <code>.pth</code> files in this way.</p>

<p>This sounds like a somewhat bad idea, but maybe not a <em>horrible</em> idea.</p>

<p>If you do this, let me know.</p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s your theme?</h2>

<p>Have you played with setting a theme in your own Python REPL?</p>

<p>What theme are you using?</p>

        <div class="p-4 flex-grow overflow-hidden">
          <p class="text-base-content">
            <p>This summer I participated in the <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">Google Summer of Code</a> program with Django. My work focused on introducing keyboard shortcuts to the Django admin interface which led to a new package: <a href="https://github.com/khanxmetu/django-admin-keyshortcuts">django-admin-keyshortcuts</a>.</p>
<h4 id="s-proposal-and-community-discussions">Proposal and Community Discussions</h4>
<p>My original GSoC proposal was to improve the existing <a href="https://github.com/knyghty/django-admin-keyboard-shortcuts">django-admin-keyboard-shortcuts</a> package maintained by one of my mentors, Tom. The plan was to fix bugs, add new keyboard shortcuts, build a command palette, and eventually merge these features into Django's core admin. I initially thought getting my GSoC proposal accepted meant I could dive straight into coding. But Tom explained that Django has its own process for new features, which starts off with community discussions.</p>
<p>After posting on the forum and gathering feedback, we decided to focus on keyboard shortcuts only, and continue exploring that in packages rather than target Django core immediately. This way the feature can be tested and improved more quickly without waiting on Django's <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/download/#supported-versions">long release cycle</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/teams/#accessibility-team">accessibility team</a> helped drafting keyboard shortcuts outlining key requirements and expected outcomes, in particular making sure shortcuts would be widely compatible with browsers and assistive technologies. That document served as the base for developing django-admin-keyshortcuts.</p>
<h4 id="s-django-admin-keyshortcuts">django-admin-keyshortcuts</h4>
<p>This package adds useful keyboard shortcuts to the Django admin interface. The goal is to make the Django admin interface faster to navigate and more accessible to keyboard-first users. Here are some of the shortcuts we have added so far:</p>
<ul>
<li><kbd>/</kbd> focuses the search bar.</li>
<li><kbd>j</kbd>/<kbd>k</kbd> focuses next/previous object.</li>
<li><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>s</kbd> saves the object.</li>
<li><kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>d</kbd> prompts to delete the object.</li>
</ul>
<p>The package also comes with a keyboard shortcuts dialog, crucial so users of the admin can discover those new features:</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of the keyboard shortcuts dialog displayed as a modal over the Django admin interface. It displays 6 shortcuts" src="https://media.djangoproject.com/blog/images/2025/09/khanxmetu.github.io_django-admin-keyshortcuts-demo_demo_artist_.png" /></p>
<p>Developers can also define custom shortcuts by extending admin templates. Detailed instructions can be found in the package's README.</p>
<p>Under the hood, the package uses the <a href="https://github.com/github/hotkey">hotkey library</a> for handling shortcuts. The library seems to be well maintained (compared to other alternatives) and is used for keyboard shortcuts in GitHub.</p>
<h4 id="s-whats-next">What's next</h4>
<p>We have made a lot of progress, but there's still work to do before we can push to merge this functionality inside Django core.</p>
<h5 id="s-implementation-issues">Implementation issues</h5>
<p>Right now, there are a couple of known problems:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/khanxmetu/django-admin-keyshortcuts/issues/2">Shortcuts do not trigger when input or textfield is focused</a>: </li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/khanxmetu/django-admin-keyshortcuts/issues/3">Shortcut keys not consistent when switched to non-US layouts</a>: </li>
</ul>
<p>To address these we may wait for the hotkey library maintainers to implement the necessary fixes, or look for alternatives.</p>
<h5 id="s-gather-feedback">Gather feedback</h5>
<p>We want more users to try it out! Testing in different scenarios will help find bugs faster and improve the package. The default shortcut set is also small, we need feedback to determine which shortcuts are most useful. We also plan to list the package on a new "Experiments" section on the new <a href="/community/ecosystem/">Django Ecosystem</a> page to make it more visible.</p>
<p>But for now, try it out and let us know what you think! We have a <a href="https://khanxmetu.github.io/django-admin-keyshortcuts-demo/demo/release/">static admin demo</a> for people to directly try the shortcuts. Or install <a href="https://github.com/khanxmetu/django-admin-keyshortcuts">django-admin-keyshortcuts</a> to test it on your own project.</p>
<p><a class="cta" href="https://khanxmetu.github.io/django-admin-keyshortcuts-demo/demo/release/">Try the new shortcuts</a></p>
<p>Let us know what you think <a href="https://forum.djangoproject.com/t/feedback-django-admin-keyboard-shortcuts/42783">over on the Django Forum</a>!</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I love work.  I love working late nights, hacking on things.  This week I
didn&#8217;t go to sleep before midnight once.  And yet…</p>
<p>I also love my wife and kids. I love long walks, contemplating life over good
coffee, and deep, meaningful conversations.  None of this would be possible if
my life was defined by 12 hour days, six days a week.  More importantly, a
successful company is not a sprint, it&#8217;s a marathon.</p>
<p>And this is when this is your own company!  When you devote 72 hours a week to
someone else&#8217;s startup, you need to really think about that arrangement a few
times.  I find it highly irresponsible for a founder to promote that model.  As
a founder, you are not an employee, and your risks and leverage are
fundamentally different.</p>
<p>I will always advocate <a href="/2024/12/26/reflecting-on-life/">for putting the time
in</a> because it is what brought me happiness.
Intensity, and giving a shit about what I&#8217;m doing, will always matter to me.
But you don&#8217;t measure that by the energy you put in, or the hours you&#8217;re
sitting in the office, but the output you produce.  Burning out on twelve-hour
days, six days a week, has no prize at the end.  It&#8217;s unsustainable, it
shouldn&#8217;t be the standard and it sure as hell should not be seen as a positive
sign of a company.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve pulled many all-nighters, and I&#8217;ve enjoyed them.  I still do.  But they&#8217;re
enjoyable in the right context, for the right reasons, and when that is a
completely personal choice, not the basis of company culture.</p>
<p>And that all-nighter?  It comes with a fucked up and unproductive morning the
day after.</p>
<p>When someone promotes a 996 work culture, we should push back.</p>

            <p>Gaming as a hobby is <strong>about to become much more expensive</strong> in the United States due to tariffs.
I cannot recall a time in the past where a <strong>console's price has increased during its generation</strong>, and yet the Xbox Series X &amp; S, the Nintendo Switch, and most recently the Playstation 5
have had price hikes. These are not normal times.</p>

<p>So here's another entry in my mini-series (<a href="https://sethmlarson.dev/extracting-nes-and-famicom-roms-from-animal-crossing">#1</a>, <a href="https://sethmlarson.dev/extracting-genesis-and-game-gear-roms-from-sega-gamecube-collections">#2</a>) of extracting ROMs from GameCube games, this time
the “Zelda Collector's Edition” which contains 2 NES and 2 N64 Zelda titles.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>This article only took so long because I was trying to actually implement
the Nintendo “TGC” archive format, but it turns out that even the popular
tools handling TGC can't parse the NES ROMs out of the archives included
in the Zelda Collector's Edition game properly. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>

<p>So instead I <a href="https://gist.github.com/sethmlarson/1352edca04fbcfb62656249d7603745b">created a script</a> which looks for NES and N64 ROM header magic strings (<code>NES\x1A</code> and <code>\x80\x37\x12\x40</code>)
and used <a href="https://datomatic.no-intro.org/">known lengths</a> for these ROMs instead of the TGC format for framing information.
<em>So much easier!</em></p>

<p>You know the drill by now: buying these games costs over $150 USD and “Zelda Collector's Edition” for
the GameCube <a href="https://www.pricecharting.com/game/gamecube/zelda-collector%27s-edition">only costs ~$50 USD</a>.
Pretty good savings, especially for two of the most celebrated Zelda titles. However, the price is
high enough that you might consider buying a year of “Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack” if you already have the console.</p>

<p>I still haven't beaten “Ocarina of Time” or “Majora's Mask”, even though I know they are both masterpieces.
The only Legend of Zelda
games I've beaten end-to-end are “<a href="https://www.pricecharting.com/game/gamecube/zelda-wind-waker">Wind Waker</a>” and “<a href="https://www.pricecharting.com/game/gamecube/zelda-four-swords-adventures">Four Swords Adventures</a>”, can you tell I'm a GameCube player?
Let me know what your favorite Legend of Zelda title is.</p>

            <p>Au début juillet, dans mon précédent post <a href="https://wirtel.be/post/2025/07/10/migration-hugo-obsidian-cv/">Utilisation d&rsquo;Obsidian pour Hugo</a> , j’expliquais que je regardais comment utiliser <a href="https://obsidian.md">Obsidian</a> comme source pour mon blog. Jusqu’ici, j’écrivais mes posts dans VS Code ou NeoVim, mais comme <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a> repose sur du Markdown, l’idée d’utiliser directement Obsidian s’est imposée assez naturellement : tout centraliser dans un seul outil, mes notes et mes articles.</p>
<p>L’avantage est que j’ai toutes mes données dans un seul et unique endroit, donc je n’ai plus besoin de rechercher mes infos pour écrire mon article et l’écriture devient plus fluide, car tout est à portée de main.</p>

    <h2>Using multiple arguments</h2>
    
      
        <p>Python's <code>print</code> function can accept more than one argument:</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">count</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">4</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"There are"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">count</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">There are 4</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>Python's <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/string-formatting/" target="_blank">f-strings</a> pair very nicely with the <code>print</code> function.</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">count</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">4</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">total</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">8</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sa">f</span><span class="s2">"</span><span class="si">{</span><span class="n">count</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2"> out of </span><span class="si">{</span><span class="n">total</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2"> is </span><span class="si">{</span><span class="n">count</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">total</span><span class="si">:</span><span class="s2">.0%</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">."</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">4 out of 8 is 50%.</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>But keep in mind that the <code>print</code> function also accepts multiple arguments.
So if you're just putting spaces between a couple variables/strings:</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">language</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"English"</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sa">f</span><span class="s2">"Current language: </span><span class="si">{</span><span class="n">language</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">"</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>You could pass multiple arguments to <code>print</code> instead:</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">language</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"English"</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"Current language:"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">language</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>Python's f-strings are <em>great</em>, but if you just need to smoosh a few values together with spaces between them, consider passing separate arguments to <code>print</code>.</p>
