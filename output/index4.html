            <p>If you haven&#8217;t been living under a rock, you will have noticed this week that a
project of my friend Peter <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenClaw">went viral on the
internet</a>.  It went by many names. The
most recent one is <a href="https://openclaw.ai/">OpenClaw</a> but in the news you might
have encountered it as ClawdBot or MoltBot depending on when you read about it.
It is an agent connected to a communication channel of your choice that <a href="https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2025/7/3/tools/">just
runs code</a>.</p>
<p>What you might be less familiar with is that what&#8217;s under the hood of OpenClaw
is a little coding agent called <a href="https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/">Pi</a>. And
Pi happens to be, at this point, the coding agent that I use almost exclusively.
Over the last few weeks I became more and more of a shill for the little agent.
After I gave a talk on this recently, I realized that I did not actually write
about Pi on this blog yet, so I feel like I might want to give some context on
why I&#8217;m obsessed with it, and how it relates to OpenClaw.</p>
<p>Pi is written by <a href="https://mariozechner.at/">Mario Zechner</a> and unlike Peter, who
aims for &#8220;sci-fi with a touch of madness,&#8221; <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup> Mario is very grounded.  Despite
the differences in approach, both OpenClaw and Pi follow the same idea: LLMs are
really good at writing and running code, so embrace this.  In some ways I think
that&#8217;s not an accident because Peter got me and Mario hooked on this idea, and
agents last year.</p>
<h2>What is Pi?</h2>
<p>So Pi is a coding agent.  And there are many coding agents.  Really, I think you
can pick effectively anyone off the shelf at this point and you will be able to
experience what it&#8217;s like to do agentic programming.  In reviews on this blog
I&#8217;ve positively talked about AMP and one of the reasons I resonated so much with
AMP is that it really felt like it was a product built by people who got both
addicted to agentic programming but also had tried a few different things to see
which ones work and not just to build a fancy UI around it.</p>
<p>Pi is interesting to me because of two main reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>First of all, it has a tiny core. It has the shortest system prompt of any
agent that I&#8217;m aware of and it only has four tools: Read, Write, Edit, Bash. </li>
<li>The second thing is that it makes up for its tiny core by providing an
extension system that also allows extensions to persist state into sessions,
which is incredibly powerful. </li>
</ul>
<p>And a little bonus: Pi itself is written like excellent software. It doesn&#8217;t
flicker, it doesn&#8217;t consume a lot of memory, it doesn&#8217;t randomly break, it is
very reliable and it is written by someone who takes great care of what goes
into the software.</p>
<p>Pi also is a collection of little components that you can build your own agent
on top.  That&#8217;s how OpenClaw is built, and that&#8217;s also how I built my own little
Telegram bot and how Mario built his
<a href="https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/tree/main/packages/mom">mom</a>.  If you want
to build your own agent, connected to something, Pi when pointed to itself and
mom, will conjure one up for you.</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s Not In Pi</h2>
<p>And in order to understand what&#8217;s in Pi, it&#8217;s even more important to understand
what&#8217;s not in Pi, why it&#8217;s not in Pi and more importantly: why it won&#8217;t be in
Pi.  The most obvious omission is support for MCP.  There is no MCP support in
it. While you could build an extension for it, you can also do what OpenClaw
does to support MCP which is to use
<a href="https://github.com/steipete/mcporter">mcporter</a>. mcporter exposes MCP calls via
a CLI interface or TypeScript bindings and maybe your agent can do something
with it.  Or not, I don&#8217;t know :)</p>
<p>And this is not a lazy omission.  This is from the philosophy of how Pi works.
Pi&#8217;s entire idea is that if you want the agent to do something that it doesn&#8217;t
do yet, you don&#8217;t go and download an extension or a skill or something like
this. You ask the agent to extend itself.  It celebrates the idea of code
writing and running code.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not to say that you cannot download extensions.  It is very much
supported. But instead of necessarily encouraging you to download someone else&#8217;s
extension, you can also point your agent to an already existing extension, say
like, build it like the thing you see over there, but make these changes to it
that you like.</p>
<h2>Agents Built for Agents Building Agents</h2>
<p>When you look at what Pi and by extension OpenClaw are doing, there is an
example of software that is malleable like clay.  And this sets certain
requirements for the underlying architecture of it that are actually in many
ways setting certain constraints on the system that really need to go into the
core design.</p>
<p>So for instance, Pi&#8217;s underlying AI SDK is written so that a session can really
contain many different messages from many different model providers. It
recognizes that the portability of sessions is somewhat limited between model
providers and so it doesn&#8217;t lean in too much into any model-provider-specific
feature set that cannot be transferred to another.</p>
<p>The second is that in addition to the model messages it maintains custom
messages in the session files which can be used by extensions to store state or
by the system itself to maintain information that either not at all is sent to
the AI or only parts of it.</p>
<p>Because this system exists and extension state can also be persisted to disk, it
has built-in hot reloading so that the agent can write code, reload, test it and
go in a loop until your extension actually is functional.  It also ships with
documentation and examples that the agent itself can use to extend itself.  Even
better: sessions in Pi are trees.  You can branch and navigate within a session
which opens up all kinds of interesting opportunities such as enabling workflows
for making a side-quest to fix a broken agent tool without wasting context in
the main session.  After the tool is fixed, I can rewind the session back to
earlier and Pi summarizes what has happened on the other branch.</p>
<p>This all matters because for instance if you consider how MCP works, on most
model providers, tools for MCP, like any tool for the LLM, need to be loaded
into the system context or the tool section thereof on session start.  That
makes it very hard to impossible to fully reload what tools can do without
trashing the complete cache or confusing the AI about how prior invocations work
differently.</p>
<h2>Tools Outside The Context</h2>
<p>An extension in Pi can register a tool to be available to the LLM to call and
every once in a while I find this useful. For instance, despite my criticism of
how Beads is implemented, I do think that giving an agent access to a to-do list
is a very useful thing. And I do use an agent-specific issue tracker that works
locally that I had my agent build itself. And because I wanted the agent to also
manage to-dos, in this particular case I decided to give it a tool rather than a
CLI.  It felt appropriate for the scope of the problem and it is currently the
only additional tool that I&#8217;m loading into my context.</p>
<p>But for the most part all of what I&#8217;m adding to my agent are either skills or
TUI extensions to make working with the agent more enjoyable for me.  Beyond
slash commands, Pi extensions can render custom TUI components directly in the
terminal: spinners, progress bars, interactive file pickers, data tables,
preview panes.  The TUI is flexible enough that Mario proved you can <a href="https://x.com/badlogicgames/status/2008702661093454039">run Doom
in it</a>.  Not practical,
but if you can run Doom, you can certainly build a useful dashboard or debugging
interface.</p>
<p>I want to highlight some of my extensions to give you an idea of what&#8217;s
possible.  While you can use them unmodified, the whole idea really is that you
point your agent to one and remix it to your heart&#8217;s content.</p>
<h3><a href="https://github.com/mitsuhiko/agent-stuff/blob/main/pi-extensions/answer.ts"><code>/answer</code></a></h3>
<p>I <a href="/2025/12/17/what-is-plan-mode/">don&#8217;t use plan mode</a>.  I encourage the agent
to ask questions and there&#8217;s a productive back and forth.  But I don&#8217;t like
structured question dialogs that happen if you give the agent a question tool.
I prefer the agent&#8217;s natural prose with explanations and diagrams interspersed.</p>
<p>The problem: answering questions inline gets messy.  So <code>/answer</code> reads the
agent&#8217;s last response, extracts all the questions, and reformats them into a
nice input box.</p>
<img alt="The /answer extension showing a question dialog" src="/static/pi-answer.png" style="width: 100%;" />
<h3><a href="https://github.com/mitsuhiko/agent-stuff/blob/main/pi-extensions/todos.ts"><code>/todos</code></a></h3>
<p>Even though I criticize <a href="https://github.com/steveyegge/beads">Beads</a> for its
implementation, giving an agent a to-do list is genuinely useful.  The <code>/todos</code>
command brings up all items stored in <code>.pi/todos</code> as markdown files.  Both the
agent and I can manipulate them, and sessions can claim tasks to mark them as in
progress.</p>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/mitsuhiko/agent-stuff/blob/main/pi-extensions/review.ts"><code>/review</code></a></h3>
<p>As more code is written by agents, it makes little sense to throw unfinished
work at humans before an agent has reviewed it first.  Because Pi sessions are
trees, I can branch into a fresh review context, get findings, then bring fixes
back to the main session.</p>
<img alt="The /review extension showing review preset options" src="/static/pi-review.png" style="width: 100%;" />
<p>The UI is modeled after Codex which provides easy to review commits, diffs,
uncommitted changes, or remote PRs.  The prompt pays attention to things I care
about so I get the call-outs I want (eg: I ask it to call out newly added
dependencies.)</p>
<h3><a href="https://github.com/mitsuhiko/agent-stuff/blob/main/pi-extensions/control.ts"><code>/control</code></a></h3>
<p>An extension I experiment with but don&#8217;t actively use.  It lets one Pi agent send
prompts to another.  It is a simple multi-agent system without complex
orchestration which is useful for experimentation.</p>
<h3><a href="https://github.com/mitsuhiko/agent-stuff/blob/main/pi-extensions/files.ts"><code>/files</code></a></h3>
<p>Lists all files changed or referenced in the session.  You can reveal them in
Finder, diff in VS Code, quick-look them, or reference them in your prompt.
<code>shift+ctrl+r</code> quick-looks the most recently mentioned file which is handy when
the agent produces a PDF.</p>
<p>Others have built extensions too: <a href="https://github.com/nicobailon/pi-subagents">Nico&#8217;s subagent
extension</a> and
<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/pi-interactive-shell">interactive-shell</a> which
lets Pi autonomously run interactive CLIs in an observable TUI overlay.</p>
<h2>Software Building Software</h2>
<p>These are all just ideas of what you can do with your agent.  The point of it
mostly is that none of this was written by me, it was created by the agent to my
specifications.  I told Pi to make an extension and it did.  There is no MCP, there are
no community skills, nothing.  Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I use tons of skills.  But
they are hand-crafted by my clanker and not downloaded from anywhere.  For
instance I fully replaced all my CLIs or MCPs for browser automation with a
<a href="https://github.com/mitsuhiko/agent-stuff/blob/main/skills/web-browser/SKILL.md">skill that just uses
CDP</a>.
Not because the alternatives don&#8217;t work, or are bad, but because this is just
easy and natural.  The agent maintains its own functionality.</p>
<p>My agent has <a href="https://github.com/mitsuhiko/agent-stuff/tree/main/skills">quite a few
skills</a> and crucially
I throw skills away if I don&#8217;t need them.  I for instance gave it a skill to
read Pi sessions that other engineers shared, which helps with code review.  Or
I have a skill to help the agent craft the commit messages and commit behavior I
want, and how to update changelogs.  These were originally slash commands, but
I&#8217;m currently migrating them to skills to see if this works equally well.  I
also have a skill that hopefully helps Pi use <code>uv</code> rather than <code>pip</code>, but I also
added a custom extension to intercept calls to <code>pip</code> and <code>python</code> to redirect
them to <code>uv</code> instead.</p>
<p>Part of the fascination that working with a minimal agent like Pi gave me is
that it makes you live that idea of using software that builds more software.
That taken to the extreme is when you remove the UI and output and connect it
to your chat.  That&#8217;s what OpenClaw does and given its tremendous growth,
I really feel more and more that this is going to become our future in one
way or another.</p>

            <p>When you’re building a Docker image for your Python application, you’re building on top of an existing image—and there are many possible choices for the resulting container.
There are OS images like Ubuntu, and there are the many different variants of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">python</code> base image.
And now there’s a new choice, installing Python using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">uv</code>, which allows you to use any base image you’d like.</p>

<p>Which one should you use?
Which one is better?
There are many choices, and it may not be obvious which is the best for your situation.</p>

<p>So to help you make a choice that fits your needs, in this article I’ll go through some of the relevant criteria, and suggest some reasonable defaults that will work for most people.</p>

    <h2>Looping over dictionaries gives keys</h2>
    
      
        <p>When you <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/looping-over-dictionaries/" target="_blank">loop over a dictionary</a>, you'll get the keys in that dictionary:</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">my_dict</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="s1">'red'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'blue'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'green'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">}</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">thing</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">my_dict</span><span class="p">:</span>
<span class="gp">... </span>    <span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">thing</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="gp">...</span>
<span class="go">red</span>
<span class="go">blue</span>
<span class="go">green</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>If you loop over a dictionary in a <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/what-are-list-comprehensions/" target="_blank">list comprehensions</a>, you'll also get keys:</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">names</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">upper</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">my_dict</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">names</span>
<span class="go">['RED', 'BLUE', 'GREEN']</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>Iterable unpacking with <code>*</code> also relies on iteration.
So if we use this to iterate over a dictionary, we again get the keys:</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">my_dict</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">red blue green</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>The same thing happens if we use <code>*</code> to unpack a dictionary into a list:</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">colors</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">"purple"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">my_dict</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">colors</span>
<span class="go">['purple', 'red', 'blue', 'green']</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>And even <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/tuple-unpacking/" target="_blank">tuple unpacking</a> relies on iteration.
Anything you can loop over can be unpacked.
Since we know there are three items in our dictionary, we could unpack it:</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">c</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">my_dict</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>And of course, as strange as it may seem, we get the keys in our dictionary when we unpack it:</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">a</span>
<span class="go">'red'</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">b</span>
<span class="go">'blue'</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>So what would happen if we turned our dictionary into a list by passing it to the <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/using-list/" target="_blank">list constructor</a>?</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="nb">list</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">my_dict</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>Well, <code>list</code> will loop over whatever iterable was given to it and make a new list out of it.
And when we loop over a dictionary, what do we get?</p>

      
        <p>The keys:</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="nb">list</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">my_dict</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">['red', 'blue', 'green']</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>And of course, if we ask whether something is <code>in</code> a dictionary, we are asking about the keys:</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="s1">'blue'</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">my_dict</span>
<span class="go">True</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>Iterating over a dictionary object in Python will give you keys, no matter what Python feature you're using to do that iteration.
<strong>All forms of iteration do the same thing</strong> in Python.</p>

      
        <p><strong>Aside</strong>: of course if you want key-value pairs you <em>can</em> get them using the dictionary <code>items</code> method.</p>

      
    
  
    <h2>Looping over strings provides characters</h2>
    
      <p>Strings are also iterables.</p>

            <p>在2026年，对于开发者而言，最激动人心的AI应用之一便是Claude。不，不是那个Claude，而是Claudebot——一个免费的开源项目。它远非又一个平庸的聊天机器人，而是一个能在现实世界中全天候采取行动的工具，无需休息。它能记住一切，并通过Telegram或WhatsApp与您联系，逐步自动化您的整个生活。</p>

<p>最近几周，整个社区都为之疯狂。它在创纪录的时间内获得了超过65,000颗GitHub星标，并导致Mac Mini销量飙升，随处可见其售罄的身影。在今天的文章中，我们将亲身体验它的全部功能。</p>

<h3 id="从claudebot到openclaw的演变">从Claudebot到OpenClaw的演变</h3>

<p>然而，它的迅速普及也带来了一些问题。本周早些时候，坚信开源AI对普通人来说过于危险的Anthropic公司采取了行动。他们认为Claudebot这个名字与他们珍视的Claude过于相似，因此威胁开发者，要求其更改名称。</p>

<p>于是，Claudebot正式更名为Moltbot。但等等，Moltbot这个名字听起来确实不怎么样。就在今天，它再次更名，迎来了其最终形态——OpenClaw。同一个强大的AI助手，换上了一个全新的龙虾身份。现在是2026年1月30日，您正在阅读的是一篇关于这款工具的深度解析。</p>

<p>OpenClaw由一位杰出的开发者创建，他的GitHub个人资料简直就是一幅纯粹、不间断的软件痴迷热图。这位开发者在退休后，为了一个“安可”而回归，免费为我们带来了这个强大的工具。</p>

<h3 id="openclaw的核心功能">OpenClaw的核心功能</h3>

<p>OpenClaw是一个用TypeScript编写的工具，它包装了Claude和GPT-5等模型，能够7x24小时不间断运行。</p>

<p><strong>它能做什么？</strong></p>

  <li>追踪您在股市中的盈亏</li>
  <li>自信地部署代码</li>
</ul>

<p>最棒的是，所有这些功能都可以在您自己的小型自托管VPS、树莓派，甚至是Mac Mini上运行。您完全没有理由每月支付29美元给某个初创公司来使用类似的服务。</p>

<p>为了理解其全部潜力，让我们现在就动手实践一下。</p>

<h3 id="安装与配置">安装与配置</h3>

<p>第一步是安装。这可以在任何系统上通过一个简单的命令完成，尽管Linux是首选的路径。</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># 示例安装命令</span>
curl <span class="nt">-fsSL</span> https://openclaw.ai/install.sh | bash

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>安装后，您就可以使用 <code class="highlighter-rouge">openclaw</code> 命令了（早期版本可能是 <code class="highlighter-rouge">clawbot</code> 或 <code class="highlighter-rouge">moltbot</code>）。首先，您需要进行引导设置。</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>安全须知</strong>：系统会提示您阅读关于所有潜在风险的安全文档。</li>
  <li><strong>连接AI模型</strong>：接下来是连接AI模型提供商。您可以选择任何您喜欢的模型，这里我们以内置的Anthropic API密钥为例。虽然Anthropic API是收费的，但您也可以轻松使用免费的开源模型。</li>
  <li><strong>配置即时通讯应用</strong>：第二个主要组件是连接一个即时通讯应用，如Telegram、Slack、WhatsApp或Discord。我们选择Telegram，它的设置非常简单。
    <ul>
      <li>在Telegram中与<code class="highlighter-rouge">BotFather</code>开始聊天。</li>
      <li>为您的机器人选择一个名字，<code class="highlighter-rouge">BotFather</code>会给您一个访问令牌（Access Token）。请妥善保管此令牌。</li>
      <li>将这个令牌提供给OpenClaw。</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>配置技能（Skills）</strong>：接下来，系统会要求您配置一些技能。它有许多内置技能，您也可以添加自己的技能。甚至还有一个名为MoltHub的平台，提供了大量预构建的技能。</li>
  <li><strong>配置钩子（Hooks）</strong>：最后是关于钩子的配置。钩子允许您接入工具运行时的不同生命周期事件。这非常有用，例如，如果您希望它记住之前会话中发生的事情，或者在重要事件发生时触发后续的自动化操作。</li>
</ol>

<p>完成初始设置后，您会看到一个网关仪表盘，您可以在这里管理一切。它提供了一个基本的聊天界面和大量的配置设置。</p>

<h3 id="通过telegram释放其力量">通过Telegram释放其力量</h3>

<p>我们的目标是通过Telegram来使用OpenClaw。为此，我们需要在Telegram中向我们之前创建的机器人发送一条消息。</p>

<p>您会注意到，初始状态是“访问未配置”（Access not configured），机器人会回复一个配对码。我们需要做的就是将这个配对码带入终端，并运行以下命令：</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>openclaw pair YOUR_PAIRING_CODE
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>现在，一切准备就绪。我们可以开始发送消息，它会以Anthropic的Claude作为后端AI模型进行回应。</p>

<p>接下来，我们可以通过聊天来塑造它的个性。例如，我将它命名为“杰夫的助手”，并告诉它表现得像一个随性的、带着火热表情符号的小魔怪。</p>

<p>真正强大的地方在于，我们现在可以直接在聊天中构建自动化。</p>

<p><strong>自动化示例：</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>追踪股票</strong>：也许我想查看一下我在微软的投资表现如何。我们可以通过Telegram询问OpenClaw。它不仅会一次性地拉取数据，还会在后台设置一个自动化任务来持续追踪这支股票。当股价有显著波动时，我们就会在Telegram上收到消息。这样，我就再也无需手动检查股票了。</li>
  <li><strong>准备面试</strong>：假设因为投资失利，我需要找一份真正的工作。我可以安装一个技能，让它自动为软件工程师生成面试问题。</li>
</ul>

<p>这仅仅是OpenClaw强大功能的冰山一角。它是一个您绝对值得一试的卓越工具。</p>

            <p>Regular readers of this blog will know that I started a new company.  We have
put out just a <a href="https://earendil.com/purpose/">tiny bit of information today</a>,
and some keen folks have discovered and reached out by email with many
thoughtful responses.  It has been delightful.</p>
<p><a href="https://colin.day/">Colin</a> and I met here, in Vienna.  We started sharing
coffees, ideas, and lunches, and soon found shared values despite coming from
different backgrounds and different parts of the world.  We are excited about
the future, but we&#8217;re equally vigilant of it.  After traveling together a bit,
we decided to plunge into the cold water and start a company together.  We want
to be successful, but we want to do it the right way and we want to be able to
demonstrate that to our kids.</p>
<p>Vienna is a city of great history, two million inhabitants and a fascinating
vibe that is nothing like San Francisco.  In fact, Vienna is in many ways the
polar opposite to the Silicon Valley, both in mindset, in opportunity and
approach to life.  Colin comes from San Francisco, and though I&#8217;m Austrian, my
career has been shaped by years working with California companies and people
from there who used my Open Source software.  Vienna is now our shared home.
Despite Austria being so far away from California, it is a place of tinkerers
and troublemakers.  It&#8217;s always good to remind oneself that society consists of
more than just your little bubble.  It also creates the necessary counter
balance to think in these times.</p>
<p>The world that is emerging in front of our eyes is one of change.  We
incorporated as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benefit_corporation">PBC</a> with
a founding charter to craft software and open protocols, strengthen human
agency, bridge division and ignorance and to cultivate lasting joy and
understanding.  Things we believe in deeply.</p>
<p>I have dedicated 20 years of my life in one way or another creating Open Source
software.  In the same way as artificial intelligence calls into question the
very nature of my profession and the way we build software, the present day
circumstances are testing society.  We&#8217;re not immune to
these changes and we&#8217;re navigating them like everyone else, with a mixture of
excitement and worry.  But we share a belief that right now is the time to stand
true to one&#8217;s values and principles.  We want to take an earnest shot at leaving
the world a better place than we found it.  Rather than reject the changes that
are happening, we look to nudge them towards the right direction.</p>

            <p>Two years ago I discovered a potential foot-gun
with the Python standard library “<code>re</code>” module.
<a href="https://sethmlarson.dev/regex-%24-matches-end-of-string-or-newline">I blogged about this behavior</a>,
and turns out that
I wasn't only one who didn't know this:
The article was #1 on HackerNews and the
most-read article on my blog in 2024.
In short the unexpected behavior is that the pattern “<code>^Hello$</code>” matches both “<code>Hello</code>” and “<code>Hello\n</code>”,
and sometimes you don't intend to match a trailing newline.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>This article serves as a follow-up!
Back in 2024
<a href="https://sethmlarson.dev/regex-%24-matches-end-of-string-or-newline#:~:text=Pattern matches">I created a table</a> showing that <code>\z</code> was a partially viable
alternative to <code>$</code> for matching end-of-string
without matching a trailing newline... for every regular expression
implementation <strong>EXCEPT</strong> Python and EMCAScript. </p>

<p>But that is no longer true, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.14.html#re">Python 3.14</a> now supports <code>\z</code>! This means <code>\z</code> is <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/133306">one step closer</a>
to being the universal recommendation to match
the end of string without matching a newline.
Obviously no one is upgrading their Python
version just for this new feature, but it's good to know that
the gap is being closed. Thanks to David Wheeler
for doing deeper research in the <a href="https://best.openssf.org">OpenSSF Best Practices
WG</a> and <a href="https://best.openssf.org/Correctly-Using-Regular-Expressions">publishing this report</a>.</p>

<p>Until Python 3.13 is deprecated and long gone: using <code>\Z</code> (as an alias for <code>\z</code>) works fine for Python regular expressions.
Just note that this behavior isn't the same <a href="https://best.openssf.org/Correctly-Using-Regular-Expressions#guidance">across regular expression
implementations</a>, for example EMCAScript, Golang, and Rust
don't support <code>\Z</code> and for PHP, Java, and .NET <code>\Z</code> <em>actually
matches trailing newlines!</em></p>

            <p>This year marks the ninth iteration of the official Python Developers Survey. We intentionally launched the survey in January (later than years prior) so that data collection and results can be completed and shared within the same calendar year. The survey aims to capture the current state of the Python language and its surrounding ecosystem. By comparing the results with last year’s, the community can identify emerging trends and gain deeper insight into how Python continues to evolve.<br /><br />We encourage you to contribute to our community’s knowledge by sharing your experience and perspective. Your participation is valued! The survey should only take you about 10-15 minutes to complete.&nbsp;<br /><br /><a href="https://surveys.jetbrains.com/s3/python-developers-survey-2026" target="_blank">Contribute to the Python Developers Survey 2026!</a><br /><br />This year we aim to reach even more of our community and ensure accurate global representation by highlighting our localization efforts:&nbsp;<br /></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>The survey is translated into Chinese, French, German, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish.&nbsp;</li><li>To assist individuals in promoting the survey and encouraging their local communities and professional networks we have created a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C3r-dFY5LmklzCnf72vfeehzRqCCDuXzK8xKuwBES1Y/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Promotion Kit</a> with images and social media posts translated into a variety of languages. We hope this promotion kit empowers folks to spread the invitation to respond to the survey within their local communities.</li><li>We’d love it if you’d share one or more of the posts in the Promotion Kit to your social media or any community accounts you manage, as well as share the information in Python related discords, mailing lists, or chats you participate in.</li><li>If you would like to help out with translations you see are missing, please request edit access to the doc and share what language you will be translating to. Translations for promotions into languages the survey may not be translated to is also welcome!&nbsp;</li></ul><p>If you have ideas about what else we can do to get the word out and encourage a diversity of responses, please comment on <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/your-python-your-voice-join-the-python-developers-survey-2026/105883" target="_blank">the corresponding Discuss thread</a>.&nbsp;<br /><br />The survey is organized in partnership between the <a href="https://www.python.org/psf-landing/" target="_blank">Python Software Foundation</a> and <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/" target="_blank">JetBrains</a>. After the survey is over, JetBrains will publish the aggregated results and randomly choose 20 winners (among those who complete the survey in its entirety), who will each receive a $100 Amazon Gift Card or a local equivalent.<br /><br /></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/kushaldas/replyfast">replyfast</a> is a Python module to receive and send messages on <a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a>.</p>
<p>You can install it via </p>
<p><code>python3 -m pip install replyfast</code> </p>
<p>or </p>
<p><code>uv pip install replyfast</code> </p>
<p>I have to add Windows builds to CI though.</p>
<p>I have a <a href="https://github.com/kushaldas/replyfast/blob/main/register.py">script</a> to help you to register as a device, and
then you can send and receive messages.</p>
<p>I have a <a href="https://github.com/kushaldas/replyfast/blob/main/examples/demo_bot.py">demo bot</a> which shows both sending and rreceiving messages, and also how to schedule work following the <code>crontab</code> syntaxt.</p>
<pre><code class="language-Python">    scheduler.register(
        &quot;*/5 * * * *&quot;,
        send_disk_usage,
        args=(client,),
        name=&quot;disk-usage&quot;,
    )
</code></pre>
<p>This is all possible due to the <a href="https://github.com/whisperfish/presage">presage</a> library written in Rust.</p>
          </p>

<a href="https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/how-to/assert.html#assertions-about-expected-exceptions" rel="external noopener"><code>pytest.raises</code></a> as a context manager, and have
separate tests for the cases that succeed and those that fail.  Instead, this

</blockquote><p>One parameterized test that covers both good and bad outcomes. Nice.</p><h1 id="h_antilru">AntiLRU<a class="headerlink" href="#h_antilru"></a></h1><p>The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.lru_cache" rel="external noopener"><code>@functools.lru_cache</code></a> decorator (and its
convenience cousin <code>@cache</code>) are good ways to save the result of a function
so that you don&#8217;t have to compute it repeatedly.  But, they hide an implicit
global in your program: the dictionary of cached results.</p><p>This can interfere with testing. Your tests should all be isolated from each
other. You don&#8217;t want a side effect of one test to affect the outcome of another
test. The hidden global dictionary will do just that. The first test calls the
cached function, then the second test gets the cached value, not a newly
computed one.</p><p>Ideally, lru_cache would only be used on <em>pure</em> functions: the result only depends on the arguments.
If it&#8217;s only used for pure functions, then you don&#8217;t need to worry about interactions between tests
because the answer will be the same for the second test anyway.</p><p>But lru_cache is used on functions that pull information from the
environment, perhaps from a network API call.  The tests might mock out the API
to check the behavior under different API circumstances. Here&#8217;s where the
interference is a real problem.</p><p>The lru_cache decorator makes a <code>.clear_cache</code> method available on each
decorated function. I had some code that explicitly called that method on the
cached functions. But then I added a new cached function, forgot to update the
conftest.py code that cleared the caches, and my tests were failing.</p><p>A more convenient approach is provided by
<a href="https://pypi.org/project/pytest-antilru/" rel="external noopener">pytest-antilru</a>: it&#8217;s a pytest plugin that monkeypatches
<code>@lru_cache</code> to track all of the cached functions, and clears them all
between tests. The caches are still in effect during each test, but can&#8217;t
interfere between them.</p><p>It works great. I was able to get rid of all of the manually maintained cache
clearing in my conftest.py.</p>

            Building on the web is like working with the perfect clay. It’s malleable and can become almost anything. But too often, frameworks try to hide the web’s best parts away from us. Today, we’re looking at PyView, a project that brings the real-time power of Phoenix LiveView directly into the Python world. I'm joined by Larry Ogrodnek to dive into PyView.

            This is part one of a series covering core DynamoDB concepts and patterns, all the way up to single-table design; the goal is to get you to understand idiomatic usage and trade-offs in under an hour. Today, we're looking at what DynamoDB is and why it is that way.

            <p>السر يكمن في “السرعة بدون فأرة” (Mouse-free Speed).</p>

<p><strong>Vim</strong> ليس مجرد محرر نصوص، هو <em>لغة</em> لتحرير النصوص.
بدلاً من أن تمسك الفأرة وتحدد سطراً لتحذفه، تضغط <code class="highlighter-rouge">dd</code>. لتغيير كلمة داخل قوسين، تضغط <code class="highlighter-rouge">ci"</code>.
بمجرد أن تتعود على هذه الاختصارات (Muscle Memory)، يصبح التعديل بسرعة تفكيرك.</p>

<p><strong>لكن…</strong>
VS Code هو بيئة تطوير متكاملة (IDE) رائعة جداً، وحديثة، وسهلة.
الخبر الجيد؟ لا تحتاج للاختيار! حمل إضافة <strong>Vim</strong> في VS Code واحصل على أفضل ما في العالمين: سرعة Vim وذكاء VS Code. 🚀</p>
