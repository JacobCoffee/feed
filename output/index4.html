            Let's say you want to create a web app and you know Python really well. Your first thought might be Flask or Django or even FastAPI? All good choices but there is a lot to get a full web app into production. The framework we'll talk about today, Reflex, allows you to just write Python code and it turns it into a full web app running FastAPI, NextJS, React and more plus it handles the deployment for you. It's a cool idea. Let's talk to Elvis Kahoro and Nikhil Rao from Reflex.dev.

    <p>I am Abigail(Afi), a DSF member who has contributed to the Django Ecosystem for about four years. I have held the following positions in the community:</p>
    
    <ul>
    <li>Leadership council member for Black Python Devs (current)</li>
    <li>Open Source Program Manager for Black Python Devs - I am managing 39 of our community members make their first steps in open source (current)</li>
    <li>Programs Team member for DjangoCon US 2024</li>
    <li>Contributed in organizing Django Girls Zanzibar (2023) ahead of the first DjangoCon Africa, co-organiser of Django Girls in Kwahu-Ghana (2019), and coach at Django Girls Ho-Ghana; 2018, 2024 and Zanzibar (2023)</li>
    <li>DjangoCon US Speaker 2023, you can watch my talk here: <a href="https://youtu.be/YrlSlOZOkNQ?si=1kyvMAy4PUgZMxhw" rel="ugc">Strategies for Handling Conflicts and Rollbacks with Django</a></li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>I have extensive experiences with the community, which have contributed to my growth, and I believe serving on the board is a good way to give back. As such, I am positive that I would bring a refreshing perspective to the board and be a good match for community integration with Django.</p>
    
    <p>As a board member, I plan to increase interactions between the DSF and its user base by providing an official mailing list highlighting non-technical and technical updates that will keep Django users up-to-date with current developments and build a relationship with our user base. Through this, I aim to gather djangonauts from everywhere to support creating the next leaders of the Django community.</p>
    
    <p>In addition, I would like to use my experience in fostering Strategic Partnerships and Fundraising in the nonprofit space to help the DSF Fundraising WG find more sponsors for the DSF. While working with a community, I fostered vital partnerships with about 10 organisations, which contributed to reaching our Fundraising and Partnerships goal despite most organisations slashing nonprofit donations.</p>
    
    <p>As such, I believe those skills, coupled with my community experience, will contribute to the growth of the Django Community, especially when we attract sponsors and increase their efforts and visibility on our social media.</p></blockquote></details></section>
    <section><h2 id="alex-gomez"><strong>Alex Gómez</strong> <i>Barcelona, Spain</i> <a class="plink" href="#alex-gomez">¶</a></h2><details>View personal statement<blockquote><p>I began developing with Django at version 1.11 and have been an avid user since. I am a member of <a href="https://djangonaut.space" rel="ugc">Djangonaut Space</a> and was previously a Djangonaut in the program. I’m also an active member of Python Spain and Python Barcelona and have coached at multiple DjangoGirls workshops.</p>
    
    <p>I believe the next few years will be crucial for Django's future. It’s important for us to remain relevant and ensure that Django continues to be a choice for new projects, not just for maintaining existing ones.</p>
    
    <p>The DSF needs an executive director, we’ve reached the limit of what a volunteer board can do or be asked to do. This is my first and main priority for 2025 and I believe without such a change we will struggle to meaningfully advance.</p>
    
    <p>An obstacle to enacting an executive director is the need to expand the foundation's funding and pool of sponsors, and I propose that one of our most effective ways to achieve this is by expanding our communications. Too little of the Django user base is reached by the DSF and other non-official Django communications, leaving a wide userbase who may be very willing to support the project but do not know they can.</p>
    
    <p>In support of these goals, I will also make the website a priority. We’re years into attempting to revamp it, the last successful attempt being a decade ago. The website working group is not yet finalized, an executive director will help us push this forward.</p>
    
    <p>The DSF needs fresh perspectives, and with your support I believe I will bring positive changes to the Django community.</p></blockquote></details></section>

    <p>As a young Black African woman in STEM from the francophone region of Africa and an active DSF member, I’ve dedicated my career to fostering inclusivity and representation in the tech community and I am confident that I bring a unique perspective to the table. My extensive experience organizing major events like:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>DjangoCon US 2024, </li>
    <li>DjangoCon Africa 2023, and </li>
    <li>PyCon Africa 2020 (as a volunteer) | 2024 (as an IOC member ) has equipped me with the skills and insights needed to drive inclusivity and community engagement.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>My journey has been fueled by a passion for diversity and representation. I have seen firsthand the incredible impact that inclusive environments can have on underrepresented communities, especially in Africa, and I am dedicated to amplifying these voices within the Django ecosystem. As a mentor in the both the Python and the Django Community, as well as a mentor and community manager at BEL'S AI Initiative in Cameroon, I have empowered many young technologists, fostering a supportive and inclusive community.</p>
    
    <p>I aim to bridge the gap between the DSF Board and our vibrant African community, ensuring that our unique perspectives and needs are heard and addressed. I am committed to being the voice of Africa within the board and representing the board within my community. By voting for me, you are supporting a vision of inclusivity, innovation, and growth for the Django community.</p>
    <p>To achieve this, I plan to:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Launch official DSF multilingual mentoring programs, targeted at underrepresented groups from Africa, with plans to expand globally.</li>
    <li>Introduce the Django Diversity Incubator, offering resources, workshops, scholarships, and global hackathons to underrepresented groups around the world.</li>
    <li>Create a Django Open Source Fellows interns role, to welcome new people into code and non-code contributions.</li>

    <section><h2 id="bhuvnesh-sharma"><strong>Bhuvnesh Sharma</strong> <i>India</i> <a class="plink" href="#bhuvnesh-sharma">¶</a></h2><details>View personal statement<blockquote><p>Hi everyone!  I'm excited to throw my hat in the ring for the DSF Board of Directors.</p>
    
    <p>To me, there appears to be a critical component that could benefit from increased attention: social media and marketing. And I believe It's time we start giving Django the social media attention it deserves.</p>
    <p>Let's be real: If we master this social media game, Django's reach will explode, and the entire ecosystem will thrive.</p>
    <p>The more we boost Django’s presence online, the more up-and-coming developers will flock to it. And with that surge in usage comes the rise of Django-focused communities—stronger, more engaged, and constantly growing.</p>
    
    <p>Now, here’s where it gets exciting: more visibility leads to a snowball effect.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Visibility drives growth: More eyes on Django → more users → more contributors</li>
    <li>Quality fuels adoption: More contributors → better Django → increased commercial usage</li>
    <li>Success attracts support: Increased usage → more sponsors → resources for further expansion</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Then guess what? We loop back to the start: Django gets bigger, stronger, and better.</p>
    
    <p>Here are few-of-many pointers that I am aiming to start with during my tenure as a board member:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Boost Django's presence in Asia through targeted outreach and events.</li>
    <li>Launch Django Ambassadors program to recognize influential community members.</li>
    <li>Facilitate non-coding contributions to Django (design, content, event organizing).</li>
    <li>Create a volunteer layer between the DSF and interested individuals who are eager to contribute to specific working groups (WGs).</li>
    <li>Produce engaging social media content similar to Feature Fridays.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>I am highly motivated to lead Django’s social media and marketing as a Board member. I have more high-level plans and ideas in mind, and I’m focused on finding the right time and people for their execution. Additionally, I would represent the Asia region and bring valuable diversity in the DSF board. You can read more about my plans in the blog here: <a href="https://devilsautumn.hashnode.dev/making-django-unstoppable-my-plan-to-boost-visibility-and-drive-growth" rel="ugc">Making Django Unstoppable: My Plan to Boost Visibility and Drive Growth</a></p>
    
    <p>Now talking about myself, I am a django core contributor and have been involved with DSF for around past 1.5 years as a DSF member. I also did Google Summer of Code with Django in 2023 and mentored in Google Summer of Code 2024 with Django. Apart from code contributions I have contributed to Django in various others ways:</p>
    
    <ul>
    <li>I am Co-Chair at the social media WG at DSF. (all the Feature Fridays posts are created by me :) )</li>
    <li>I was a navigator at Djangonaut Space’s first session.</li>
    <li>I recently started a community called Django India with an aim to popularize Django in India.</li>
    </ul>

From the outset, participating in developer meetups and events, particularly DjangoCon Africa, has not only strengthened my technical skills but also reshaped my understanding of growth—both personal and professional. </p>
    
    <p>Driven by a desire to make a meaningful difference, I am pursuing a position on the Django Software Foundation Board. I bring a commitment to promoting diversity, inclusivity, and accessibility within the Django ecosystem. As a vocal advocate for African and minority communities, I believe my presence on the Board would add a valuable perspective to the DSF’s mission, ensuring that emerging developers from underrepresented backgrounds find opportunities, resources, and community support in Django.</p>
    
    <p>My experience with the Swahilipot Hub Foundation, a Kenyan NGO supporting youth along the coast, has equipped me with essential skills in community engagement and in applying technology for social good. Through this role, I have developed Django-based solutions that empower community self-management—an experience that has reinforced my belief in Django’s potential to uplift communities around the globe. On the DSF Board, I aim to serve not only as a representative for these communities but also as a mentor and technical guide.</p></blockquote></details></section>
    <section><h2 id="cory-zue"><strong>Cory Zue</strong> <i>Cape Town, South Africa</i> <a class="plink" href="#cory-zue">¶</a></h2><details>View personal statement<blockquote><p>I’m running for the board because I love Django, I’ve built my career on it, I want to see it succeed for another 20 years, and I think I can help.</p>
    
    <p>My background is as a Django user and educator. I’ve built several successful products on Django, spoken at multiple DjangoCons and PyCons and have published many popular articles and videos about using Django. I currently run a Django boilerplate product that helps people build apps and start businesses on top of Django. I’m also a member of the DSF and the social media working group.</p>
    
    <p>My platform is relatively simple. I don’t want Django to get left behind. I’ve seen old frameworks like Rails and Laravel continually reinvent themselves, bringing new cohorts of web developers into the fold, while Django has largely stayed the same.</p>
    
    <p>Part of the issue is Django’s reluctance to adopt modern technologies— with better front end being at the top of my list. But I don’t have unrealistic aspirations of adding HTMX, Tailwind, or React to Django, so much as starting the conversation about how the Django ecosystem can have a better story for people who want to use those things.</p>
    
    <p>The other part—and the part I hope to help with more—is cultural. Specifically, getting Django to do a better job at selling itself. This means working harder to pitch and position Django as a great, modern framework for building apps. As well as creating more opportunities and incentives for funding Django.</p>
    
    <p>If elected, I’ll try to be a voice on the board that pushes Django forwards, while understanding that I will often get pushed back. Let’s keep Django great for another 20 years!</p></blockquote></details></section>

    <p>In 2019, during DjangoCon Europe in Copenhagen, I strongly desired to take my community involvement to the next level. I proposed to organize DjangoCon Europe 2020 in Portugal. Though the pandemic reshaped those plans, I co-organized the first virtual-only DjangoCon Europe in 2020, another virtual edition in 2021, and the first hybrid event in 2022. Our 2022 edition set a new record, with over 500 in-person attendees and 200+ online participants. The experience has been gratifying, and I continue to be actively involved in the community by co-organizing DjangoCon Europe 2024 in Vigo, Spain, and preparing for DjangoCon Europe 2025 in Dublin, Ireland.</p>
    
    <p>In addition to my work with Django, I am deeply committed to the growth of the Python community in Portugal. In 2022, I co-founded PyCon Portugal, intending to host the conference in a different city each year to maximize its reach and impact. The first edition in Porto succeeded, followed by Coimbra in 2023, which attracted participants from over 25 countries. By the time of this election, PyCon Portugal 2024 in Braga will have concluded, furthering our goal of uniting and strengthening the Portuguese Python community.</p>
    
    <p>I am enthusiastic, committed, and pragmatic. In every initiative I’ve taken, I strive to make a positive and meaningful impact, influencing and empowering those around me. My experience organizing large-scale events, building communities, and fostering collaboration can be valuable to the Django Software Foundation.</p>
    
    <p>I look forward to contributing my skills and dedication to help guide the DSF’s efforts in the years ahead.</p></blockquote></details></section>

    <p>The key to making the DSF more sustainable is the stability that hiring an Executive Director brings. From day-to-day communications to supporting the Django Fellows to improving our ability to fundraise, everything revolves around having someone whose job is to run and support the foundation. I believe an ED will help Django get a seat to more conversations involving open source and web standards that we get passed over today. </p>
    
    <p>I bring over two decades of non-profit experience, including co-founding DEFNA (the other Django non-profit) and serving on the Python Software Foundation, including leadership roles (Treasurer and Vice Chair). I have also helped organize DjangoCon US for over a decade, and we have seen many community members and leaders grow through that community-building experience. I'm an advisor for Black Python Devs and have been a mentor through the Djangonaut Space project. </p>
    
    <p>I want to revise and revisit our sponsorship plans and fundraising goals. They have not changed much over the years despite companies' needs changing significantly. We did this with the PSF, and it increased the number of developers in resident roles (the PSF's version of Fellows) we could fund. It's time for the DSF to revise our plans. </p>
    
    <p>I want to revise our approach to DjangoCons and other "why aren't they called DjangoCon" community events. Why aren't more of these promoted or listed through the Django website? </p>
    
    <p>I firmly believe in the Campsite Rule: "Always leave the campground cleaner than you found it." I feel good about the mark I have left on the Django and Python communities over this past decade, and I am happy to serve the Django community in a more significant role if given the opportunity. </p></blockquote></details></section>

    <p>In 2018 and 2019, I helped organize PyCon Balkan in Belgrade (Serbia). Since 2016, I've coached and organized Django Girls workshops around the world, including in Rio de Janeiro (Brazil), Budapest (Hungary), Brno (Czechia), Belgrade (Serbia), Porto (Portugal), and Vigo (Spain).</p>

    <p>Before assisting to DjangoCon US, I saw Django as just part of the larger Python community. But seeing how this community goes above and beyond to support both longtime members and newcomers changed that for me. When others suggested I run for the board, it felt like a way I could give back and share what makes Django special on a global scale.</p>
    
    <h3>A Bit About Me</h3>
    <p>I co-founded and organized the Python Paraguay community, starting with our first PyDay in 2015, which was a huge success and sparked a lasting momentum. Since then, I’ve organized meetups, events, workshops, and grown our community to almost two thousand members—the most active tech group in Paraguay! I also used Django for projects that make a difference: <a href="https://ayudapy.org/" rel="ugc">AyudaPy.org</a>, a mutual aid platform during COVID-19 (which I presented at DjangoCon US 2022), and <a href="https://listahu.org/" rel="ugc">Lista Hũ</a>, a tool to protect against scammers, both of which highlight Django’s potential for social good.</p>
    
    <h3>Ideas for Django</h3>
    
    <ul>
    <li>Learning Curve: Improving the Django tutorial and expanding learning resources can make Django more accessible and less intimidating for newcomers. Creating more comprehensive, step-by-step guides will empower new developers and ease their journey into Django.</li>
    <li>Supporting Global Accessibility: Expanding Django’s reach by focusing on language accessibility and gathering regional feedback is key. Adding questions to the Django Developers Survey on preferred languages and translation quality could help the community prioritize localization efforts, ensuring developers worldwide feel supported in their native languages.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>I believe this community is on the right path, and it would be an honor to contribute as a board member</p></blockquote></details></section>

    <p>I think that the Django Software Foundation has the potential to facilitate and promote these initiatives. It also has the authority to relate to other Open Source communities, to seek synergies, and with big corporations, to grow from an economic point of view, being able to pay more people (e.g., Django Fellows, Directors, UI/UX experts, …)</p>

    <p>If you are one of the regulars on the official Django Discord server, my passion and dedication to both the Django community and framework should be no secret. As a helper, I have helped countless other developers use Django successfully. As a moderator, I do my best to ensure that we have a community that we can all be proud to consider our own, regardless of our background. An environment that is inclusive, diverse, and welcoming. To me, it feels like home, and I hope you all feel the same way.</p>
    
    <p>For those I haven't yet had the pleasure to meet on Discord or elsewhere, I hope we do soon.</p>
    
    <p>About me:</p>
    
    <ul>
    <li>I have been building on the web since the Geocities days, and have over 17 years of professional experience, meaning I know how to get things done.</li>
    <li>I have experience building and managing communities, including forums and subreddits, meaning I can readily help with the technical and human aspects.</li>
    <li>I am proactive, and lucky enough to have a lot of flexibility in how I spend my time, meaning I can help turn decisions into action.</li>
    <li>I am open-minded, and eager to learn, meaning I am looking forward to working for the community, with the board, rather than wanting to impose my own ideas.</li>
    <li>I am a polyglot speaking more than four languages fluently, meaning I feel connections to others, regardless of geographical borders.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>If elected, my goals will be:</p>
    
    <ul>
    <li>Collaborating with the other board members. Django's popularity and stability is a testament to the fantastic work current and past board members and developers have done, and while I may have my own ideas, I would first want to know more about any backlog, plans, or other issues that need to be resolved rather than bring about drastic changes.</li>
    <li>Efficiently implementing board decisions. While plans may sometimes forcibly change, they at least need someone to take charge of them. I am happy to lend my technical expertise when required, and deal with other roadblocks.</li>
    <li>Community representation. As a fairly visible member of the Django community, I am looking forward to ensuring the community feels represented and heard, and seeing what more we can do to help the community grow.</li>
    <li>Increase representation of non-English speakers. While English is the de facto business language, there are other large markets that would benefit from better support.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>As Django nears twenty years of existence, becoming a board member certainly gives us some big shoes to fill, but between my passion, this amazing community's support, and the time I can dedicate to the position, I am confident that I can help the community continue to thrive, make a tangible difference, and better serve the community we all know and love.</p>
    
    <p>Best regards, and best of luck to all the other applicants,</p>

For those that don't know me, I've also been actively contributing features for most of the last decade. I help run the Discord, the accessibility team, and I'm on the fundraising working group. If that sounds like a lot of time commitment already, you're right. If you vote for me I might have to become dormant in some other roles.</p>
    
    <p>But I don't really want to talk about my perspective as a contributor, I want to talk about my experience as a user. I've been using Django since around 2008. We have great batteries for 2008. For 2024? I am not so sure. I feel like we are missing things like:</p>
    
    <ul>
    <li>Built in 2FA with WebAuthn / passkeys.</li>
    <li>Better serialization to make APIs without needing a second framework.</li>
    <li>A better frontend story, whether that's tutorials on integrating frameworks or how to use simpler solutions like HTMX, template components (or all of the above).</li>
    <li>A more modern, accessible admin interface with better UX.</li>
    <li>Simpler project setup for small projects, including deployment and static files (integrating white noise?).</li>
    <li>(type hints maybe?)</li>
    <li>I could increase the size of this Wishlist by several factors and still not be done.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The reason I believe we're missing these things is simple (and possibly wrong). Django is getting bigger, more mature, and prioritises stability. These are all great things, but they do slow down development when almost all new features are contributed by people volunteering their time.</p>
    
    <p>To fix this, Django needs money, which is why I joined the fundraising group, and then there is the question of spending that money. And for the me the priorities are clear:</p>
    
    <ol>
    <li>Spend money to make more money.</li>
    <li>Hire more fellows and widen their remit to contributing new features.</li>
    </ol>

            <p>I talked about the new Python 3.13 REPL <a href="https://treyhunner.com/2024/05/my-favorite-python-3-dot-13-feature/">a few months ago</a> and <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/python-313-whats-new/">after 3.13 was released</a>.
I think it&rsquo;s <strong>awesome</strong>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to share a secret feature within the Python 3.13 REPL which I&rsquo;ve been finding useful recently: <strong>adding custom keyboard shortcuts</strong>.</p>

<p>This feature involves a <code>PYTHONSTARTUP</code> file, use of an unsupported Python module, and dynamically evaluating code.</p>

<p>In short, we may be getting ourselves into trouble.
But the result is <em>very</em> neat!</p>

<p>Thanks to Łukasz Llanga for inspiring this post via his excellent <a href="https://youtu.be/dK6HGcSb60Y?si=jWPEa8BcdYGnW9l6">EuroPython keynote talk</a>.</p>

<h2>The goal: keyboard shortcuts in the REPL</h2>

<p>First, I&rsquo;d like to explain the end result.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say I&rsquo;m in the Python REPL on my machine and I&rsquo;ve typed <code>numbers =</code>:</p>

<figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="pycon"><span class="line"><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">numbers</span> <span class="o">=</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I can now hit <code>Ctrl-N</code> to enter a list of numbers I often use while teaching (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas_number">Lucas numbers</a>):</p>

<figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="pycon"><span class="line"><span class="go">numbers = [2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, 29]</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>That saved me some typing!</p>

<h2>Getting a prototype working</h2>

<p>First, let&rsquo;s try out an example command.</p>

<p>Copy-paste this into your Python 3.13 REPL:</p>

<figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now hit <code>Ctrl-N</code>.</p>

<p>If all worked as planned, you should see that list of numbers entered into the REPL.</p>

<p>Cool!
Now let&rsquo;s generalize this trick and make Python run our code whenever it starts.</p>

<p>But first&hellip; a disclaimer.</p>

<h2>Here be dragons 🐉</h2>

<p>Notice that <code>_</code> prefix in the <code>_pyrepl</code> module that we&rsquo;re importing from?
That means this module is officially unsupported.</p>

<p>The <code>_pyrepl</code> module is an implementation detail and its implementation may change at any time in future Python versions.</p>

<p>In other words: <code>_pyrepl</code> is designed to be used by <em>Python&rsquo;s standard library modules</em> and not anyone else.
That means that we should assume this code will break in a future Python version.</p>

<p>Will that stop us from playing with this module for the fun of it?</p>

<p>It won&rsquo;t.</p>

<h2>Creating a <code>PYTHONSTARTUP</code> file</h2>

<p>So we&rsquo;ve made <em>one</em> custom key combination for ourselves.
How can we setup this command automatically whenever the Python REPL starts?</p>

<p>We need a <code>PYTHONSTARTUP</code> file.</p>

<p>When Python launches, if it sees a <code>PYTHONSTARTUP</code> environment variable it will treat that environment variable as a Python file to run on startup.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve made a <code>/home/trey/.python_startup.py</code> file and I&rsquo;ve set this environment variable in my shell&rsquo;s configuration file (<code>~/.zshrc</code>):</p>

<figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="bash"><span class="line"><span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">PYTHONSTARTUP</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nv">$HOME</span>/.python_startup.py
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>To start, we could put our single custom command in this file:</p>

<figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Note that I&rsquo;ve stuck our code in a <code>try</code>-<code>except</code> block.
Our code <em>only</em> runs if those <code>_pyrepl</code> imports succeed.</p>

<p>Note that this <em>might</em> still raise an exception when Python starts <em>if</em> the reader object&rsquo;s <code>command</code> attribute or <code>bind</code> method change in a way that breaks our code.</p>

<p>Personally, I&rsquo;d like to see those breaking changes occur print out a traceback the next time I upgrade Python.
So I&rsquo;m going to leave those last few lines <em>without</em> their own catch-all exception handler.</p>

<h2>Generalizing the code</h2>

<p>This version uses a dictionary to map keyboard shortcuts to the text they should insert.</p>

<p>Note that we&rsquo;re repeatedly building up a string of <code>Command</code> subclasses for each shortcut, using <code>exec</code> to execute the code for that custom <code>Command</code> subclass, and then binding the keyboard shortcut to that new command class.</p>

<p>At the end we then delete all the variables we&rsquo;ve made so our REPL will start the clean global environment we normally expect it to have:</p>

<figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>

<p>Is this messy?</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>Is that a needless use of a dictionary that could have been a list of 2-item tuples instead?</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>Does this work?</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<h2>Doing more interesting and risky stuff</h2>

<p>Note that there are many keyboard shortcuts that may cause weird behaviors if you bind them.</p>

<p>For example, if you bind <code>Ctrl-i</code>, your binding may trigger every time you try to indent.
And if you try to bind <code>Ctrl-m</code>, your binding may be ignored because this is equivalent to hitting the <code>Enter</code> key.</p>

<p>So be sure to test your REPL carefully after each new binding you try to invent.</p>

<p>If you want to do something more interesting, you could poke around in the <code>_pyrepl</code> package to see what existing code you can use/abuse.</p>

<p>For example, here&rsquo;s a very hacky way of making a binding to <code>Ctrl-x</code> followed by <code>Ctrl-r</code> to make this import <code>subprocess</code>, type in a <code>subprocess.run</code> line, and move your cursor between the empty string within the <code>run</code> call:</p>

<h2>What keyboard shortcuts are available?</h2>

<p>As you play with customizing keyboard shortcuts, you&rsquo;ll likely notice that many key combinations result in strange and undesirable behavior when overridden.</p>

<p>For example, overriding <code>Ctrl-J</code> will also override the <code>Enter</code> key&hellip; at least it does in my terminal.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll list the key combinations that seem unproblematic on my setup with Gnome Terminal in Ubuntu Linux.</p>

<p>Here are <code>Control</code> key shortcuts that seem to be complete unused in the Python REPL:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Ctrl-N</code></li>
<li><code>Ctrl-O</code></li>
<li><code>Ctrl-P</code></li>
<li><code>Ctrl-Q</code></li>
<li><code>Ctrl-S</code></li>
<li><code>Ctrl-V</code></li>
</ul>


<p>Note that overriding <code>Ctrl-H</code> is often an alternative to the backspace key</p>

<p>Here are <code>Alt</code>/<code>Meta</code> key shortcuts that appear unused on my machine:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Alt-A</code></li>
<li><code>Alt-E</code></li>
<li><code>Alt-G</code></li>
<li><code>Alt-H</code></li>
<li><code>Alt-I</code></li>
<li><code>Alt-J</code></li>
<li><code>Alt-K</code></li>
<li><code>Alt-M</code></li>
<li><code>Alt-N</code></li>
<li><code>Alt-O</code></li>
<li><code>Alt-P</code></li>
<li><code>Alt-Q</code></li>
<li><code>Alt-S</code></li>
<li><code>Alt-V</code></li>
<li><code>Alt-W</code></li>
<li><code>Alt-X</code></li>
<li><code>Alt-Z</code></li>
</ul>


<p>You can add an <code>Alt</code> shortcut by using <code>\M</code> (for &ldquo;meta&rdquo;).
So <code>r"\M-a"</code> would capture <code>Alt-A</code> just as <code>r"\C-a"</code> would capture <code>Ctrl-A</code>.</p>

<p>Here are keyboard shortcuts that <em>can</em> be customized but you might want to consider whether the current default behavior is worth losing:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Alt-B</code>: backward word (same as <code>Ctrl-Left</code>)</li>
<li><code>Alt-C</code>: capitalize word (does nothing on my machine&hellip;)</li>
<li><code>Alt-D</code>: kill word (delete to end of word)</li>
<li><code>Alt-F</code>: forward word (same as <code>Ctrl-Right</code>)</li>
<li><code>Alt-L</code>: downcase word (does nothing on my machine&hellip;)</li>
<li><code>Alt-U</code>: upcase word (does nothing on my machine&hellip;)</li>
<li><code>Alt-Y</code>: yank pop</li>
<li><code>Ctrl-A</code>: beginning of line (like the <code>Home</code> key)</li>
<li><code>Ctrl-B</code>: left (like the <code>Left</code> key)</li>
<li><code>Ctrl-E</code>: end of line (like the <code>End</code> key)</li>
<li><code>Ctrl-F</code>: right (like the <code>Right</code> key)</li>
<li><code>Ctrl-G</code>: cancel</li>
<li><code>Ctrl-H</code>: backspace (same as the <code>Backspace</code> key)</li>
<li><code>Ctrl-K</code>: kill line (delete to end of line)</li>
<li><code>Ctrl-T</code>: transpose characters</li>
<li><code>Ctrl-U</code>: line discard (delete to beginning of line)</li>
<li><code>Ctrl-W</code>: word discard (delete to beginning of word)</li>
<li><code>Ctrl-Y</code>: yank</li>
<li><code>Alt-R</code>: restore history (within history mode)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>This instalment in a series of articles about API integrations with Salesforce
covers connected apps - how to create them
and how to obtain their credentials needed to exchange REST messages with Salesforce.</p>
<p>In Salesforce's terminology, a connected app is, essentially, an API client. It has credentials, a set of permissions,
and it works on behalf of a user in an automated manner.</p>
<p>In particular, the kind of a connected app that I am going to create below is one that can be used in backend, server-side
integrations that operate without any direct input from end users or administrators, i.e. the app is created once, its permissions
and credentials are set once, and then it is able to work uninterrupted in the background, on server side.</p>
<p>Server-side systems are quite unlike other kinds of apps, such as mobile ones, that assume there is a human operator involved -
they have their own work characteristics, related yet different, and I am not going to cover them here.</p>
<p>Note that permission types and their scopes are a separate, broad subject and they will described in a separate how-to article.</p>
<p>Finally, I assume that you are either an administrator in a Salesforce organization or that you are preparing information
for another person with similar grants in Salesforce.</p>
<p>Conceptually, there is nothing particularly unusual about Salesforce connected apps, it is just its own mini-world
of jargon and, at the end of the day, it simply enables you to invoke APIs that Salesforce is built on. It is just that knowing
where to click, what to choose and how to navigate the user interface can be a daunting challenge that this article hopes
to make easier to overcome.</p>
<h2 id="the-steps">The steps</h2>
<p>For an automated, server-side connected app to make use of Salesforce APIs, the requirements are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Having access to username/password credentials</li>
<li>Creating a connected app</li>
<li>Granting permissions to the app (not covered in this article)</li>
<li>Obtaining a customer key and customer secret for the app</li>
</ul>
<p>You will note that there are four credentials in total:</p>
<ul>
<li>Username</li>
<li>Password</li>
<li>Customer key</li>
<li>Customer secret</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, depending on what chapter of the Salesforce documentation you are reading, you will note that the customer key
can be also known as "client_id" whereas another name for the customer secret is "client_secret". These two pairs
mean the same.</p>
<h2 id="access-to-usernamepassword-credentials">Access to username/password credentials</h2>
<p>For starters, you need to have an account in Salesforce, a combination of username + password that you can log in with
and on whose behalf the connected app will be created:</p>
<p><img src="https://upcdn.io/kW15bqq/raw/root/static/blog/images/3.2-salesforce/app-login.png" /></p>
<h2 id="creating-a-connected-app">Creating a connected app</h2>
<p>Once you are logged in, go to Setup in the top right-hand corner:</p>
<p><img src="https://upcdn.io/kW15bqq/raw/root/static/blog/images/3.2-salesforce/app-setup.png" /></p>
<p>In the search box, look up "app manager":</p>
<p><img src="https://upcdn.io/kW15bqq/raw/root/static/blog/images/3.2-salesforce/app-search-manager.png" /></p>
<p>Next, click the "New Connected App" button to the right:</p>
<p><img src="https://upcdn.io/kW15bqq/raw/root/static/blog/images/3.2-salesforce/app-new-connected-button.png" /></p>
<p>Fill out the basic details such as "Connect App Name" and make sure that you select "Enable OAuth Settings". Then,
given that in this document we are not dealing with the subject of permissions at all, grant full access to the connected
app and finally click "Save" at the bottom of the page.</p>
<p><img src="https://upcdn.io/kW15bqq/raw/root/static/blog/images/3.2-salesforce/app-full-access.png" /></p>
<h2 id="obtaining-a-customer-key-and-customer-secret">Obtaining a customer key and customer secret</h2>
<p>We have a connected app but we still do not know what its customer key and secret are. To reveal it, go to the "App Manager"
once more, either via the search box or using the menu on the left hand side.</p>
<p><img src="https://upcdn.io/kW15bqq/raw/root/static/blog/images/3.2-salesforce/app-manager-menu.png" /></p>
<p>Find your app in the list and click "View" in the list of actions. Observe that it is "View", not "Edit" or "Manage", where
you can check what the credentials are:</p>
<p><img src="https://upcdn.io/kW15bqq/raw/root/static/blog/images/3.2-salesforce/app-view.png" /></p>
<p>The customer key and secret van be now revealed in the "API (Enable OAuth Settings)" section:</p>
<p><img src="https://upcdn.io/kW15bqq/raw/root/static/blog/images/3.2-salesforce/app-view-secrets.png" /></p>
<p>This concludes the process - you have a connected app and all the credentials needed now.</p>
<h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>
<p>Seeing as this document is part of a series of how-tos in the context of Zato, if you would like to integrate with Salesforce in
Python, at this point you will be able to follow the steps in
<a href="https://zato.io/en/blog/salesforce-python.html">another</a>
where everything is detailed separately.</p>
<p>Just as a quick teaser, it would look akin to the below.</p>

<p>On a much lower level, however, if you would just like to quickly test out whether you configured the connected app correctly,
you can invoke from command line a Salesforce REST endpoint that will return an OAuth token, as below.</p>
<p>Note that, as I mentioned it previously, client_id is the same as customer key and client_secret is the same as customer secret.</p>

            Do you struggle to make sure your code is always correct before you check it in? What about your team members' code? That one person who never wants to run the linter? Tired of dealing with tons of conflicts and spurious git changes? You need git pre-commit hooks. We're lucky to have Stefanie Molin on this episode who has done a bunch of writing and teaching of git hooks.

            <p>As is probably apparent from the sequence of blog posts about the topic in the
last year, I have been thinking about and working on integer optimizations in the JIT
compiler a lot. This work was mainly motivated by <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.pydrofoil.org/en/latest/">Pydrofoil</a>, where integer
operations matter a lot more than for your typical Python program.</p>
<p>In this post I'll describe my most recent change, which is a new small domain
specific language that I implemented to specify peephole optimizations on
integer operations in the JIT.
It uses pattern matching to specify how (sequences of) integer operations
should be simplified and optimized. The rules are then compiled to
RPython code that then becomes part of the JIT's optimization passes.</p>
<p>To make it less likely to introduce incorrect optimizations into the JIT, the
rules are automatically proven correct with Z3 as part of the build process (for
a more hands-on intro to how that works you can look at the <a class="reference external" href="https://pypy.org/posts/2024/08/toy-knownbits.html#proving-correctness-of-the-transfer-functions-with-z3">knownbits</a> post).
In this blog post I want to motivate why I introduced the DSL and give an
introduction to how it works.</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>This summer, after I wrote my <a class="reference external" href="https://www.pypy.org/posts/2024/07/mining-jit-traces-missing-optimizations-z3.html">scripts to mine JIT traces for missed optimization</a>
opportunities, I started implementing a few of the integer peephole rewrite that
the script identified. Unfortunately, doing so led to the problem that the way
we express these rewrites up to now is very imperative and verbose. Here's a
snippet of RPython code that shows some rewrites for integer multiplication
(look at the comments to see what the different parts actually do). You don't
need to understand the code in detail, but basically it's in very imperative
style and there's quite a lot of boilerplate.</p>

<p>Adding more rules to these functions is very tedious and gets super confusing
when the functions get bigger. In addition I am always worried about making
mistakes when writing this kind of code, and there is no feedback at all about
which of these rules are actually applied a lot in real programs.</p>
<p>Therefore I decided to write a small domain specific language with the goal of
expressing these rules in a more declarative way. In the rest of the post I'll
describe the DSL (most of that description is adapted from the <a class="reference external" href="https://rpython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jit/ruleopt.html">documentation</a>
about it that I wrote).</p>
</section>
<section id="the-peephole-rule-dsl">
<h2>The Peephole Rule DSL</h2>
<section id="simple-transformation-rules">
<h3>Simple transformation rules</h3>
<p>The rules in the DSL specify how integer operation can be transformed into
cheaper other integer operations. A rule always consists of a name, a pattern,
and a target. Here's a simple rule:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">add_zero: int_add(x, 0)
    =&gt; x</pre>
<p>The name of the rule is <code class="docutils literal">add_zero</code>. It matches operations in the trace of the
form <code class="docutils literal">int_add(x, 0)</code>, where <code class="docutils literal">x</code> will match anything and <code class="docutils literal">0</code> will match only the
constant zero. After the <code class="docutils literal">=&gt;</code> arrow is the target of the rewrite, i.e. what the
operation is rewritten to, in this case <code class="docutils literal">x</code>.</p>
<p>The rule language has a list of which of the operations are commutative, so <code class="docutils literal">add_zero</code>
will also optimize <code class="docutils literal">int_add(0, x)</code> to <code class="docutils literal">x</code>.</p>
<p>Variables in the pattern can repeat:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">sub_x_x: int_sub(x, x)
    =&gt; 0</pre>
<p>This rule matches against <code class="docutils literal">int_sub</code> operations where the two arguments are the
same (either the same box, or the same constant).</p>
<p>Here's a rule with a more complicated pattern:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">sub_add: int_sub(int_add(x, y), y)
    =&gt; x</pre>
<p>This pattern matches <code class="docutils literal">int_sub</code> operations, where the first argument was
produced by an <code class="docutils literal">int_add</code> operation. In addition, one of the arguments of the
addition has to be the same as the second argument of the subtraction.</p>
<p>The constants <code class="docutils literal">MININT</code>, <code class="docutils literal">MAXINT</code> and <code class="docutils literal">LONG_BIT</code> (which is either 32 or 64,
depending on which platform the JIT is built for) can be used in rules, they
behave like writing numbers but allow bit-width-independent formulations:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">is_true_and_minint: int_is_true(int_and(x, MININT))
    =&gt; int_lt(x, 0)</pre>
<p>It is also possible to have a pattern where some arguments needs to be a
constant, without specifying which constant. Those patterns look like this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">sub_add_consts: int_sub(int_add(x, C1), C2) # incomplete
    # more goes here
    =&gt; int_sub(x, C)</pre>
<p>Variables in the pattern that start with a <code class="docutils literal">C</code> match against constants only.
However, in this current form the rule is incomplete, because the variable <code class="docutils literal">C</code>
that is being used in the target operation is not defined anywhere. We will see
how to compute it in the next section.</p>
</section>
<section id="computing-constants-and-other-intermediate-results">
<h3>Computing constants and other intermediate results</h3>
<p>Sometimes it is necessary to compute intermediate results that are used in the
target operation. To do that, there can be extra assignments between the rule head
and the rule target.:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">sub_add_consts: int_sub(int_add(x, C1), C2) # incomplete
    C = C1 + C2
    =&gt; int_sub(x, C)</pre>
<p>The right hand side of such an assignment is a subset of Python syntax,
supporting arithmetic using <code class="docutils literal">+</code>, <code class="docutils literal">-</code>, <code class="docutils literal">*</code>, and certain helper functions.
However, the syntax allows you to be explicit about unsignedness for some
operations. E.g. <code class="docutils literal">&gt;&gt;u</code> exists for unsigned right shifts (and I plan to add
<code class="docutils literal">&gt;u</code>, <code class="docutils literal">&gt;=u</code>, <code class="docutils literal">&lt;u</code>, <code class="docutils literal">&lt;=u</code> for comparisons).</p>
<p>Here's an example of a rule that uses <code class="docutils literal">&gt;&gt;u</code>:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">urshift_lshift_x_c_c: uint_rshift(int_lshift(x, C), C)
    mask = (-1 &lt;&lt; C) &gt;&gt;u C
    =&gt; int_and(x, mask)</pre>
</section>
<section id="checks">
<h3>Checks</h3>
<p>Some rewrites are only true under certain conditions. For example,
<code class="docutils literal">int_eq(x, 1)</code> can be rewritten to <code class="docutils literal">x</code>, if <code class="docutils literal">x</code> is known to store a boolean value. This can
be expressed with <em>checks</em>:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">eq_one: int_eq(x, 1)
    check x.is_bool()
    =&gt; x</pre>
<p>A check is followed by a boolean expression. The variables from the pattern can
be used as <code class="docutils literal">IntBound</code> instances in checks (and also in assignments) to find out
what the abstract interpretation of the JIT knows about the value of a trace variable
(<code class="docutils literal">IntBound</code> is the name of the abstract domain that the JIT uses for integers,
despite the fact that it also stores <a class="reference external" href="https://www.pypy.org/posts/2024/08/toy-knownbits.html">knownbits</a> information nowadays).</p>
<p>Here's another example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">mul_lshift: int_mul(x, int_lshift(1, y))
    check y.known_ge_const(0) and y.known_le_const(LONG_BIT)
    =&gt; int_lshift(x, y)</pre>
<p>It expresses that <code class="docutils literal">x * (1 &lt;&lt; y)</code> can be rewritten to <code class="docutils literal">x &lt;&lt; y</code> but checks that
<code class="docutils literal">y</code> is known to be between <code class="docutils literal">0</code> and <code class="docutils literal">LONG_BIT</code>.</p>
<p>Checks and assignments can be repeated and combined with each other:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">mul_pow2_const: int_mul(x, C)
    check C &gt; 0 and C &amp; (C - 1) == 0
    shift = highest_bit(C)
    =&gt; int_lshift(x, shift)</pre>
<p>In addition to calling methods on <code class="docutils literal">IntBound</code> instances, it's also possible to
access their attributes, like in this rule:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">and_x_c_in_range: int_and(x, C)
    check x.lower &gt;= 0 and x.upper &lt;= C &amp; ~(C + 1)
    =&gt; x</pre>
</section>
<section id="rule-ordering-and-liveness">
<h3>Rule Ordering and Liveness</h3>
<p>The generated optimizer code will give preference to applying rules that
produce a constant or a variable as a rewrite result. Only if none of those
match do rules that produce new result operations get applied. For example, the
rules <code class="docutils literal">sub_x_x</code> and <code class="docutils literal">sub_add</code> are tried before trying <code class="docutils literal">sub_add_consts</code>,
because the former two rules optimize to a constant and a variable
respectively, while the latter produces a new operation as the result.</p>
<p>The rule <code class="docutils literal">sub_add_consts</code> has a possible problem, which is that if the
intermediate result of the <code class="docutils literal">int_add</code> operation in the rule head is used by
some other operations, then the <code class="docutils literal">sub_add_consts</code> rule does not actually
reduce the number of operations (and might actually make things slightly worse
due to increased register pressure). However, currently it would be extremely
hard to take that kind of information into account in the optimization pass of
the JIT, so we optimistically apply the rules anyway.</p>
</section>
<section id="checking-rule-coverage">
<h3>Checking rule coverage</h3>
<p>Every rewrite rule should have at least one unit test where it triggers. To
ensure this, the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pypy/pypy/blob/d92d0bfd38318ede1cbaadadafd77da69d431fad/rpython/jit/metainterp/optimizeopt/test/test_optimizeintbound.py">unit test file that mainly checks integer optimizations</a> in the
JIT has an assert at the end of a test run, that every rule fired at least once.</p>
</section>
<section id="printing-rule-statistics">
<h3>Printing rule statistics</h3>
<p>The JIT can print statistics about which rule fired how often in the
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">jit-intbounds-stats</span></code> logging category, using the <a class="reference external" href="https://rpython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/logging.html">PYPYLOG</a> mechanism. For
example, to print the category to stdout at the end of program execution, run
PyPy like this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">PYPYLOG=jit-intbounds-stats:- pypy ...</pre>
<p>The output of that will look something like this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">int_add
    add_reassoc_consts 2514
    add_zero 107008
int_sub
    sub_zero 31519
    sub_from_zero 523
    sub_x_x 3153
    sub_add_consts 159
    sub_add 55
    sub_sub_x_c_c 1752
    sub_sub_c_x_c 0
    sub_xor_x_y_y 0
    sub_or_x_y_y 0
int_mul
    mul_zero 0
    mul_one 110
    mul_minus_one 0
    mul_pow2_const 1456
    mul_lshift 0
...</pre>
</section>
<section id="termination-and-confluence">
<h3>Termination and Confluence</h3>
<p>Right now there are unfortunately no checks that the rules actually rewrite
operations towards "simpler" forms. There is no cost model, and also nothing
that prevents you from writing a rule like this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">neg_complication: int_neg(x) # leads to infinite rewrites
    =&gt; int_mul(-1, x)</pre>
<p>Doing this would lead to endless rewrites if there is also another rule that
turns multiplication with -1 into negation.</p>
<p>There is also no checking for <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confluence_(abstract_rewriting)">confluence</a> (yet?), i.e. the property that all
rewrites starting from the same input trace always lead to the same output
trace, no matter in which order the rules are applied.</p>

<h3>Proofs</h3>
<p>It is very easy to write a peephole rule that is not correct in all corner
cases. Therefore all the rules are proven correct with Z3 before compiled into
actual JIT code, by default. When the proof fails, a (hopefully minimal)
counterexample is printed. The counterexample consists of values for all the
inputs that fulfil the checks, values for the intermediate expressions, and
then two <em>different</em> values for the source and the target operations.</p>
<p>E.g. if we try to add the incorrect rule:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">mul_is_add: int_mul(a, b)
    =&gt; int_add(a, b)</pre>
<p>We get the following counterexample as output:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">Could not prove correctness of rule 'mul_is_add'
in line 1
counterexample given by Z3:
counterexample values:
a: 0
b: 1
operation int_mul(a, b) with Z3 formula a*b
has counterexample result vale: 0
BUT
target expression: int_add(a, b) with Z3 formula a + b
has counterexample value: 1</pre>
<p>If we add conditions, they are taken into account and the counterexample will
fulfil the conditions:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">mul_is_add: int_mul(a, b)
    check a.known_gt_const(1) and b.known_gt_const(2)
    =&gt; int_add(a, b)</pre>
<p>This leads to the following counterexample:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">Could not prove correctness of rule 'mul_is_add'
in line 46
counterexample given by Z3:
counterexample values:
a: 2
b: 3
operation int_mul(a, b) with Z3 formula a*b
has counterexample result vale: 6
BUT
target expression: int_add(a, b) with Z3 formula a + b
has counterexample value: 5</pre>
<p>Some <code class="docutils literal">IntBound</code> methods cannot be used in Z3 proofs because their <a class="reference external" href="https://www.pypy.org/posts/2024/08/toy-knownbits.html#cases-where-this-style-of-z3-proof-doesnt-work).">control
flow is too complex</a>. If that is the case, they can have Z3-equivalent
formulations defined (in every case this is done, it's a potential proof hole if
the Z3 friendly reformulation and the real implementation differ from each
other, therefore extra care is required to make very sure they are equivalent).</p>
<p>It's possible to skip the proof of individual rules entirely by adding
<code class="docutils literal">SORRY_Z3</code> to its body (but we should try not to do that too often):</p>
<pre class="literal-block">eq_different_knownbits: int_eq(x, y)
    SORRY_Z3
    check x.known_ne(y)
    =&gt; 0</pre>
</section>
<section id="checking-for-satisfiability">
<h3>Checking for satisfiability</h3>
<p>In addition to checking whether the rule yields a correct optimization, we also
check whether the rule can ever apply. This ensures that there are <em>some</em>
runtime values that would fulfil all the checks in a rule. Here's an example of
a rule violating this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">never_applies: int_is_true(x)
    check x.known_lt_const(0) and x.known_gt_const(0) # impossible condition, always False
    =&gt; x</pre>
<p>Right now the error messages if this goes wrong are not completely easy to
understand. I hope to be able to improve this later:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">Rule 'never_applies' cannot ever apply
in line 1
Z3 did not manage to find values for variables x such that the following condition becomes True:
And(x &lt;= x_upper,
    x_lower &lt;= x,
    If(x_upper &lt; 0, x_lower &gt; 0, x_upper &lt; 0))</pre>

<h3>Implementation Notes</h3>
<p>The implementation of the DSL is done in a relatively ad-hoc manner. It is
parsed using <a class="reference external" href="https://rply.readthedocs.io/">rply</a>, there's a small type checker that tries to find common
problems in how the rules are written. Z3 is used via the Python API, like in
the previous blog posts that are using it. The
pattern matching RPython code is generated using an approach inspired by Luc
Maranget's paper <a class="reference external" href="http://moscova.inria.fr/~maranget/papers/ml05e-maranget.pdf">Compiling Pattern Matching to Good Decision Trees</a>. See
<a class="reference external" href="https://compiler.club/compiling-pattern-matching/">this blog post</a> for an approachable introduction.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Now that I've described the DSL, here are the rules that are equivalent to the
imperative code in the motivation section:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">mul_zero: int_mul(x, 0)
    =&gt; 0

mul_one: int_mul(x, 1)
    =&gt; x

mul_minus_one: int_mul(x, -1)
    =&gt; int_neg(x)

mul_pow2_const: int_mul(x, C)
    check C &gt; 0 and C &amp; (C - 1) == 0
    shift = highest_bit(C)
    =&gt; int_lshift(x, shift)

mul_lshift: int_mul(x, int_lshift(1, y))
    check y.known_ge_const(0) and y.known_le_const(LONG_BIT)
    =&gt; int_lshift(x, y)</pre>
<p>The current status of the DSL is that it got merged to PyPy's main branch. I
rewrote a part of the integer rewrites <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pypy/pypy/blob/d92d0bfd38318ede1cbaadadafd77da69d431fad/rpython/jit/metainterp/ruleopt/real.rules">into the DSL</a>, but some are still in the
old imperative style (mostly for complicated reasons, the easily ported ones are
all done). Since I've only been porting optimizations that had existed prior to
the existence of the DSL, performance numbers of benchmarks didn't change.</p>
<p>There are a number of features that are still missing and some possible
extensions that I plan to work on in the future:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>All the integer operations that the DSL handles so far are the variants that
do not check for overflow (or where overflow was proven to be impossible to
happen). In regular Python code the overflow-checking variants <cite>int_add_ovf</cite>
etc are much more common, but the DSL doesn't support them yet. I plan to fix
this, but don't completely understand how the correctness proofs for them
should be done correctly.</p></li>
<li><p>A related problem is that I don't understand what it means for a rewrite to be
correct if some of the operations are only defined for a subset of the input
values. E.g. division isn't defined if the divisor is zero. In theory, a
division operation in the trace should always be preceded by a check that the
divisor isn't zero. But sometimes other optimization move the check around and
the connection to the division gets lost or muddled. What optimizations can we
still safely perform on the division? There's lots of prior work on this
question, but I still don't understand what the correct approach in our
context would be.</p></li>
<li><p>Ordering comparisons like <code class="docutils literal">int_lt</code>, <code class="docutils literal">int_le</code> and their unsigned variants are
not ported to the DSL yet. Comparisons are an area where the JIT is not super
good yet at optimizing away operations. This is a pretty big topic and I've
started a project with Nico Rittinghaus to try to improve the situation a bit
more generally.</p></li>
<li><p>A more advanced direction of work would be to implement a simplified form of
<a class="reference external" href="https://egraphs-good.github.io/">e-graphs</a> (or <a class="reference external" href="https://vimeo.com/843540328">ae-graphs</a>). The JIT has like half of an e-graph data
structure already, and we probably can't afford a full one in terms of compile
time costs, but maybe we can have two thirds or something?</p></li>
</ul>

            Today's exercice is just about turning a <a href="https://python-sounddevice.readthedocs.io/en/0.5.1/examples.html#real-time-text-mode-spectrogram">very nice example of the python soundevice module</a> into something <i>that works for me©</i> to help me tune my bass.<br /><br />
Long story short, I suck at tuning my instrument and just lost my tuner...<br /><br />
This will require the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/sounddevice/">python module soundevice</a> and <a href="https://matplotlib.org/">matplotlib</a>.<br /><br />
So in order to tune my guitar I indeed need a spectrosonogram that displays the frequencies captured in real time by an audio device with an output readable enough I can actually know if I am nearing a legit frequency called a Note. <br /><br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjzcQykURdUDlWFfr3OioXv8EWNLVw6mmdR6kQGa2q6tY3arYmlmBrZsvU_9A0G_thz3FVOEnw1tQiwcUODR3u29TypUqRGBwR3-7pQmWY2hSBdqywLFuFiafN9vD6f3np4c-U9n69EjQ4Inl15z-C-0IJU0S4GZq3ketB3vqqNjr_sksyT6jV77x3xNSI/s1600/tune.png" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center;"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjzcQykURdUDlWFfr3OioXv8EWNLVw6mmdR6kQGa2q6tY3arYmlmBrZsvU_9A0G_thz3FVOEnw1tQiwcUODR3u29TypUqRGBwR3-7pQmWY2hSBdqywLFuFiafN9vD6f3np4c-U9n69EjQ4Inl15z-C-0IJU0S4GZq3ketB3vqqNjr_sksyT6jV77x3xNSI/s1600/tune.png" /></a></div>

The frequencies for the notes are pretty arbitrary and I chose to only show the frequency for E, A , D, G, B since I have a 5 strings bass.<br />
I chose the frequency between 100 and 2000 knowing that anyway any frequency below will trigger harmonics and above will trigger reasonance in the right frequency frame.<br /><br />
Plotting a spectrogram is done by tweaking the eponym matplotlib grapher with values chosen to fit my need and show me a laser thin beam around the right frequency.

<p>As of today, we have migrated all of our US storage systems over to newer infrastructure.
We&rsquo;ll post again with more details about this migration once everything has had
a week or so to bed in, but since we did the equivalent migration on our EU systems
a few months back, we have had no issues at all there.  So (touch wood) we&rsquo;re feeling
quietly confident :-)</p>
<h3 id="original-post">Original post</h3>
<p>PythonAnywhere has been around <a href="https://blog.pythonanywhere.com/197/">for over 10
years</a>, and as our platform continues to
grow with tens of thousands of users, we&rsquo;re committed to keeping it in top shape. Part
of this involves upgrading some of the older parts of our infrastructure, with a
special focus on our file storage servers &ndash; some of the oldest systems we have.</p>

            <p>It's been a month of meetup talks for me. The third and final one was about Python's early history starting right from when Guido first started working on it in December 1989 until around verson 2.3 when Python was really taking off. Inspirations for the language and various key features are discussed and an obligatory photo of a very young Guido Van Rossum is included too!</p>
<img src="/presentations/python-history/Guido3.gif" style="display: block; margin: auto; width: 80%;" />
<p>This talk was given at the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/pythonnz-christchurch/events/303804841/">October 2024</a> <a href="https://www.meetup.com/NZPUG-Christchurch/">Christchurch Python meetup</a> and the slides are <a href="/presentations/python-history/index.html">available here</a>.</p>
