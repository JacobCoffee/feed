        <div class="p-4 flex-grow overflow-hidden">
          <p class="text-base-content">
            <p>Last week I was able to purchase a Nintendo Switch 2. The console was due to arrive on Monday, so I also picked up a physical copy of Mario Kart World for $80 USD (compared to $70 USD for digital).
This is the first time I can remember that Nintendo had a different price for an identical game, just based on the medium.
At first glance this seems like a $10 USD difference, but there's a detail that gets obscured by comparing sticker price alone: <strong>who is paying storage costs.</strong></p>

<h2>Why are physical Switch 2 games more expensive than digital?</h2>

<p>Mario Kart World requires 23GB of storage. That's not a trivial amount of storage space!
I suspect Nintendo's rollout of "Game-Key Cards" isn't simply because companies wanted users to have a better experience than opening an empty jewel case.
The new hardware capabilities of the Switch 2 mean games will require more storage for HD textures, sounds, video, and models.</p>

<p>Fast and large storage is expensive, and the more a publisher has to spend on storage the fewer margins there are for their games.
Pushing games to be digital means that <strong>you, the user, are paying the storage costs instead of the publisher</strong> (in addition to the downsides of digital-only media, like fewer ownership rights, less flexibility, DMCA, etc).</p>

<p>So how much of that $10 USD savings for buying digitally is <em>diminished</em> by having to pay for storage instead of Nintendo or other games publishers?
Remember that the Nintendo Switch 2 requires the use of microSD Express (or "EX") cards, so let's look at "prices per GB" for that storage medium on the market today:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
  <th>Brand</th>
  <th>Size</th>
  <th>Cost (USD)</th>
  <th>Cost per GB</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td>SanDisk</td>
  <td>128GB</td>
  <td>$60</td>
  <td>$0.47</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>SanDisk</td>
  <td>256GB</td>
  <td>$72</td>
  <td>$0.28</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>SanDisk</td>
  <td>512GB</td>
  <td>$120</td>
  <td>$0.23</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Lexar</td>
  <td>1TB</td>
  <td>$200</td>
  <td>$0.19</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>So if we assume that microSD Express prices don't suddenly drop, around 23 cents per GB is a decent price. Many users will be paying more to avoid paying another $100 USD on top of the Nintendo Switch 2 price. If Mario Kart World uses 23 GB, that's <strong>$5.29 USD worth of microSD Express storage</strong> (23 × $0.23 = $5.29).
So when storage costs are considered, the <strong>difference between physical and digital games is less than $5 USD</strong>.</p>

<p>You might already also have digital games from your previous Nintendo Switch (you did migrate them over, right?) that will be taking up this more valuable storage space, too. How many more games do you expect to purchase over the Nintendo Switch 2's likely 8+ year lifetime? The Nintendo GameCube app for the Nintendo Switch 2 is expected to grow by <strong>1.3GB per game added</strong> to the service. GameCube archivists will recognize that number as being the size of a mini-DVD, the medium used by GameCube games.</p>

<p>All of this adds up, and you might need to <em>upgrade</em> your storage medium down the line. If you do upgrade, combined with the Switch 2's single microSD card slot means you'll be <strong>double-paying</strong> if you don't pay for enough storage up-front.</p>

<p>Buying physical copies of games whenever possible (not "Game-Key Cards") will alleviate all of these concerns, even if they're a few dollars more expensive outright. 
Reminder that this is all food for thought.
Being the physical media lover that I am, I want everyone to have all the facts when deciding how to buy their games.</p>

    <h2>What is a dunder method?</h2>
    
      
        <p>In Python, a method with two underscores around it (<code>__like_this__</code>) is referred to as a "dunder method", which stands for "double-underscore method".
As noted on my <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/terms/#dunder-method" target="_blank">Python terminology page</a>, the phrase "dunder method" isn't an official term.</p>

      
        <p>Officially, dunder methods are referred to as "special methods", though that term doesn't sound "special" enough so folks sometimes say "dunder method".
You'll also sometimes hear "magic method", though "magic method" seems to be less popular in recent years (after all, these methods aren't magical).</p>

      
        <p>Dunder methods essentially act as a sort of "hook", allowing us (Python programmers) to customize the behavior of built-in Python behaviors.</p>

first 3.14 release candidate!</p>
<p><a class="uri" href="https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3140rc1/">https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3140rc1/</a></p>
<p><strong>This is the first release candidate of Python
3.14</strong></p>
<p>This release, <strong>3.14.0rc1</strong>, is the penultimate release
preview. Entering the release candidate phase, only reviewed code
changes which are clear bug fixes are allowed between this release
candidate and the final release. The second candidate (and the last
planned release preview) is scheduled for Tuesday, 2025-08-26, while the
official release of 3.14.0 is scheduled for Tuesday, 2025-10-07.</p>
<p>There will be <strong><em>no ABI changes</em></strong> from this
point forward in the 3.14 series, and the goal is that there will be as
few code changes as possible.</p>
<h1 id="call-to-action">Call to action</h1>
<p>We <strong><em>strongly encourage</em></strong> maintainers of
third-party Python projects to prepare their projects for 3.14 during
this phase, and where necessary publish Python 3.14 wheels on PyPI to be
ready for the final release of 3.14.0, and to help other projects do
their own testing. Any binary wheels built against Python 3.14.0rc1
<strong><em>will work</em></strong> with future versions of Python 3.14.
As always, report any issues to <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues">the Python bug
tracker</a>.</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that this is a preview release and while it’s as
close to the final release as we can get it, its use is
<strong><em>not</em></strong> recommended for production
environments.</p>

<h1 id="and-now-for-something-completely-different">And now for
something completely different</h1>
<p>Today, 22nd July, is Pi Approximation Day, because 22/7 is a common
approximation of <em>π</em> and closer to <em>π</em> than 3.14.</p>
<p>22/7 is a Diophantine approximation, named after Diophantus of
Alexandria (3rd century CE), which is a way of estimating a real number
as a ratio of two integers. 22/7 has been known since antiquity;
Archimedes (3rd century BCE) wrote the first known proof that 22/7
overestimates <em>π</em> by comparing 96-sided polygons to the circle it
circumscribes.</p>
<p>Another approximation is 355/113. In Chinese mathematics, 22/7 and
355/113 are respectively known as Yuelü (约率; yuēlǜ; “approximate
ratio”) and Milü (密率; mìlǜ; “close ratio”).</p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>gRPC is a high-performance framework for building distributed systems and microservices. It leverages Protocol
Buffers for serialization and HTTP/2 for transport, making it ideal for production environments
requiring low-latency communication.</p>
<p>This Python integration with Zato demonstrates how to build scalable gRPC services with strongly-typed schemas. The approach enables efficient API orchestration and reliable data exchange between services using type-safe contracts.</p>
<p>Below you'll find a Protocol Buffer schema definition and an enterprise-ready API integration service showing end-to-end implementation.</p>
<h2 id="protocol-buffer-schema-definition">Protocol Buffer Schema Definition</h2>
<p>First, define your gRPC service contract using Protocol Buffers. This example shows a mandate registration service - a financial
services process where a customer authorizes a merchant or service provider to automatically collect recurring payments
from their bank account.</p>

            <p><em>This post is addressed to the Python community, one I am glad to be a member of.</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;m product of my community.  A decade ago I <a href="/2014/2/13/programming-communities/">wrote about how much I owed the
Python community</a>.  Recently I found
myself reminiscing again. This year at EuroPython I even gave a brief lightning
talk recalling my time in the community — it made me tear up a little.</p>
<p>There were two reasons for this trip down memory lane.  First, I had the
opportunity to be part of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqBqdNIPrbo">new Python
documentary</a>, which brought back a
flood of memories (good and bad).  Second, I&#8217;ve found myself accidentally
pulled towards agentic coding and vibe coders<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>.  Over the last month and a half
I have spoken with so many people on AI and programming and realized that a
growing number of them are people I might not, in the past, have described as
“programmers.”  Even on the way to the conference I had the pleasure to engage
in a multi-hour discussion on the train with an air traffic controller who
ventured into programming because of ChatGPT to make his life easier.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure where I first heard it, but I like the idea that you are what you
do. If you&#8217;re painting (even your very first painting) you are a painter.
Consequently if you create a program, by hand or with the aid of an agent, you
are a programmer.  Many people become programmers essentially overnight by
picking up one of these tools.</p>
<p>Heading to EuroPython this year I worried that the community that shaped me
might not be receptive to AI and agentic programming.  Some of that fear felt
warranted: over the last year I saw a number of dismissive posts in my circles
about using AI for programming.  Yet I have also come to realize that acceptance
of AI has shifted significantly.  More importantly there is pretty wide support
of the notion that newcomers will and should be writing AI-generated code.</p>
<p>That matters, because my view is that AI will not lead to <em>fewer</em> programmers.
In fact, the opposite seems likely.  AI will bring more people into programming
than anything else we have done in the last decade.</p>
<p>For the Python community in particular, this is a moment to reflect.  Python has
demonstrated its inclusivity repeatedly — think of how many people have become
successful software engineers through outreach programs (like
<a href="https://pyladies.com/">PyLadies</a>) and community support.  I myself can credit
much of my early carreer from learning from others on the Python IRC channels.</p>
<p>We need to pay close attention to vibe coding.  And that not because it might
produce lower‑quality code, but because if we don&#8217;t intentionally welcome the
next generation learning through these tools, they will miss out on important
lessons many of us learned the hard way.  It would be a mistake to treat them
as outcasts or “not real” programmers.  Remember that many of our first
programs did not have functions, were a mess of GOTO and things copy/pasted
together.</p>
<p>Every day someone becomes a programmer because they figured out how to make
ChatGPT build something.  Lucky for us: in many of those cases the AI picks
Python.  We should treat this as an opportunity and anticipate an expansion in
the kinds of people who might want to attend a Python conference.  Yet many of
these new programmers are not even aware that programming communities and
conferences exist.  It’s in the Python community’s interest to find ways to
pull them in.</p>
<p>Consider this: I can name the person who brought me into Python.  But if you
were brought in via ChatGPT or a programming agent, there may be no human there
— just the AI.  That lack of human connection is, I think, the biggest
downside.  So we will need to compensate: to reach out, to mentor, to create
on‑ramps.  To instil the idea that you should be looking for a community,
because the AI won&#8217;t do that.  We need to turn a solitary interaction with an
AI into a shared journey with a community, and to move them towards learning
the important lessons about engineering.  We do not want to have a generation
of developers held captive by a companies building vibe-coding tools with
little incentive for their users to break from those shackles.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibe_coding">vibe coders</a> here
as people that give in to having the machine program for them.  I believe
that many programmers will start in this way before they transition to more
traditional software engineering.<a class="footnote" href="#fnref-1">&#8617;</a></p></li>

            Every year the core developers of Python convene in person to focus on high priority topics for CPython and beyond. This year they met at PyCon US 2025. Those meetings are closed door to keep focused and productive. But we're lucky that Seth Michael Larson was in attendance and wrote up each topic presented and the reactions and feedback to each. We'll be exploring this year's Language Summit with Seth. It's quite insightful to where Python is going and the pressing matters.

            <p>Wing Python IDE version 11.0.2 is now available.  It improves source code analysis,
avoids duplicate evaluations of values in the Watch tool, fixes ruff as an
external code checker in the Code Warnings tool, and makes a few other minor
improvements.</p>
<img alt="Wing 11 Screen Shot" class="eye-candy-image unfloat-at-900" src="https://wingware.com/images/screenshots/wing11-screenshot.png" width="650px" /><h3>Downloads</h3><div class="note">
Be sure to <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Check</span> <span class="pre">for</span> <span class="pre">Updates</span></tt> in Wing's <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Help</span></tt> menu after downloading, to make

<p>Wing 10 and earlier versions are not affected by installation of Wing 11 and
may be installed and used independently. However, project files for Wing 10
and earlier are converted when opened by Wing 11 and should be saved under a
new name, since Wing 11 projects cannot be opened by older versions of Wing.</p>
<h2><img src="https://wingware.com/images/wing18.png" /> New in Wing 11</h2><h3>Improved AI Assisted Development</h3><p>Wing 11 improves the user interface for AI assisted development by introducing two separate
tools <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span> <span class="pre">Coder</span></tt> and <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span> <span class="pre">Chat</span></tt>. <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span> <span class="pre">Coder</span></tt> can be used to write, redesign, or extend code
in the current editor. <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span> <span class="pre">Chat</span></tt> can be used to ask about code or iterate in creating a
design or new code without directly modifying the code in an editor.</p>
<p>Wing 11's AI assisted development features now support not just OpenAI but also Claude, Grok,
Gemini, Perplexity, Mistral, Deepseek, and any other OpenAI completions API compatible AI provider.</p>
<p>This release also improves setting up AI request context, so that both automatically and
manually selected and described context items may be paired with an AI request. AI request
contexts can now be stored, optionally so they are shared by all projects, and may be used
independently with different AI features.</p>
<p>AI requests can now also be stored in the current project or shared with all projects, and Wing
comes preconfigured with a set of commonly used requests. In addition to changing code in the
current editor, stored requests may create a new untitled file or run instead in AI Chat. Wing
11 also introduces options for changing code within an editor, including replacing code,
commenting out code, or starting a diff/merge session to either accept or reject changes.</p>
<p>Wing 11 also supports using AI to generate commit messages based on the changes being committed
to a revision control system.</p>
<p>You can now also configure multiple AI providers for easier access to different models.</p>
<p>For details see <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span> <span class="pre">Assisted</span> <span class="pre">Development</span></tt> under <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Wing</span> <span class="pre">Manual</span></tt> in Wing 11's <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Help</span></tt> menu.</p>
<h3>Package Management with uv </h3><p>Wing Pro 11 adds support for the <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">uv</span></tt> package manager in the New Project dialog and the
Packages tool.</p>
<p>For details see <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Project</span> <span class="pre">Manager</span> <span class="pre">&gt;</span> <span class="pre">Creating</span> <span class="pre">Projects</span> <span class="pre">&gt;</span> <span class="pre">Creating</span> <span class="pre">Python</span> <span class="pre">Environments</span></tt> and <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Package</span>

<h3>Improved Python Code Analysis</h3><p>Wing 11 improves code analysis of literals such as dicts and sets, parametrized type
aliases, <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">typing.Self</span></tt>, type of variables on the <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">def</span></tt> or <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">class</span></tt> line that declares
them, generic classes with <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">[...]</span></tt>, <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">__all__</span></tt> in <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">*.pyi</span></tt> files, subscripts
in <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">typing.Type</span></tt> and similar, type aliases, and type hints in strings.</p>
<h3>Updated Localizations</h3><p>Wing 11 updates the German, French, and Russian localizations, and introduces a new experimental
AI-generated Spanish localization. The Spanish localization and the new AI-generated strings in the
French and Russian localizations may be accessed with the new <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">User</span> <span class="pre">Interface</span> <span class="pre">&gt;</span> <span class="pre">Include</span> <span class="pre">AI</span>
<span class="pre">Translated</span> <span class="pre">Strings</span></tt> preference.</p>
<h3>Improved diff/merge</h3><p>Wing Pro 11 adds floating buttons directly between the editors to make navigating differences
and merging easier, allows undoing previously merged changes, and does a better job managing
scratch buffers, scroll locking, and sizing of merged ranges.</p>
<p>For details see <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Difference</span> <span class="pre">and</span> <span class="pre">Merge</span></tt> under <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Wing</span> <span class="pre">Manual</span></tt> in Wing 11's <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Help</span></tt> menu.</p>
<h3>Other Minor Features and Improvements</h3><p>Wing 11 also improves the custom key binding assignment user interface, adds a <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Files</span> <span class="pre">&gt;</span>
<span class="pre">Auto-Save</span> <span class="pre">Files</span> <span class="pre">When</span> <span class="pre">Wing</span> <span class="pre">Loses</span> <span class="pre">Focus</span></tt> preference, warns immediately when opening a project with
an invalid Python Executable configuration, allows clearing recent menus, expands the set of
available special environment variables for project configuration, and makes a number of other
bug fixes and usability improvements.</p>
<h3>Changes and Incompatibilities</h3><p>Since Wing 11 replaced the <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span></tt> tool with <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span> <span class="pre">Coder</span></tt> and <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span> <span class="pre">Chat</span></tt>, and AI
configuration is completely different than in Wing 10, you will need to reconfigure your
AI integration manually in Wing 11. This is done with <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Manage</span> <span class="pre">AI</span> <span class="pre">Providers</span></tt> in the
<tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span></tt> menu. After adding the first provider configuration, Wing will set that provider as
the default. You can switch between providers with <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Switch</span> <span class="pre">to</span> <span class="pre">Provider</span></tt> in the <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span></tt> menu.</p>

If you were expecting to receive the email but have not (make sure to check your spam!), please email psf-elections@pyfound.org, and we’ll assist you. <i>Please note: If you opted out of emails related to your membership, you did not receive this email.&nbsp;</i></p><p></p><h4 style="text-align: left;">Need to check your membership status?</h4><p>Log on to psfmember.org and visit your <a href="https://psfmember.org/user-information" target="_blank">PSF Member User Information page</a>

 and then email psf-elections@pyfound.org so we can link your membership
 to your account. Please ensure you have an account linked to your 
membership so that we can have the most up-to-date contact information 
for you in the future.&nbsp;</p><h4 style="text-align: left;">How to affirm your intention to vote&nbsp;</h4><p>You can affirm your voting intention by following the steps in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWfyvPqAAJs" target="_blank">our video tutorial</a>:<br /></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Log in to psfmember.org</li><li>Check your eligibility to vote (You must be a Contributing, Supporting, or Fellow member)&nbsp;</li><li>Choose “<a href="https://psfmember.org/civicrm/votingaffirmation/" target="_blank">Voting Affirmation</a>” at the top right</li><li>Select your preferred intention for voting in 2025</li><li>Click the “Submit” button&nbsp;</li></ul><h4 style="text-align: left;">PSF Bylaws</h4><p>Section 4.2 of the <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/bylaws/" target="_blank">PSF Bylaws</a> requires that “Members of any membership class with voting rights must affirm each year to the corporation in writing that such member intends to be a voting member for such year.”</p><p>Our motivation is to ensure that our elections can meet quorum as required by Section 3.9 of <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/bylaws/" target="_blank">our bylaws</a>. As our membership has grown, we have seen that an increasing number of Contributing and Fellow members with indefinite membership do not engage with our annual election, making quorum difficult to reach.&nbsp;</p><p>An election that does not reach quorum is invalid.

with iterators along the way.</p><p>2048 has a 4<span class="times">×</span>4 grid with sliding tiles.  Because the tiles can slide
left or right and up or down, sometimes we want to loop over the rows and
columns from 0 to 3, and sometimes from 3 to 0.  My first attempt looked like
this:</p><blockquote class="code"><pre class="python"><div class="source"><span class="n">N</span>&#xa0;<span class="o">=</span>&#xa0;<span class="mi">4</span>

</pre></blockquote><p>Looks cleaner, but it doesn&#8217;t work!  Can you see why? It took me a bit of
debugging to see the light.</p><p><code>range()</code> produces an iterable: something that can be iterated over.
Similar but different is that <code>reversed()</code> produces an iterator: something
that is already iterating.  Some iterables (like ranges) can be used more than
once, creating a new iterator each time.  But once an iterator like
<code>reversed()</code> has been consumed, it is done.  Iterating it again will
produce no values.</p><p>If &#8220;iterable&#8221; vs &#8220;iterator&#8221; is already confusing here&#8217;s a quick definition:
an iterable is something that can be iterated, that can produce values in a
particular order.  An iterator tracks the state of an iteration in progress. An
analogy: the pages of a book are iterable; a bookmark is an iterator.  The
English hints at it: an iter-able is able to be iterated at some point, an
iterator is actively iterating.</p><p>The outer loop of my double loop was iterating only once over the rows, so
the row iteration was fine whether it was going forward or backward.  But the
columns were being iterated again for each row.  If the columns were going
forward, they were a range, a reusable iterable, and everything worked fine.</p><p>But if the columns were meant to go backward, they were a one-use-only
iterator made by <code>reversed()</code>.  The first row would get all the columns,
but the other rows would try to iterate using a fully consumed iterator and get
nothing.</p><p>The simple fix was to use <code>list()</code> to turn my iterator into a reusable
iterable:</p><blockquote class="code"><pre class="python"><div class="source"><span class="n">cols</span>&#xa0;<span class="o">=</span>&#xa0;<span class="nb">list</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">reversed</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">cols</span><span class="p">))</span>
<br /></div>
</pre></blockquote><p>The code was slightly less nice, but it worked.  An even better fix
was to change my doubly nested loop into a single loop:</p><blockquote class="code"><pre class="python"><div class="source"><span class="k">for</span>&#xa0;<span class="n">row</span><span class="p">,</span>&#xa0;<span class="n">col</span>&#xa0;<span class="ow">in</span>&#xa0;<span class="n">itertools</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">product</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">rows</span><span class="p">,</span>&#xa0;<span class="n">cols</span><span class="p">):</span>
<br /></div>
</pre></blockquote><p>That also takes care of the original iterator/iterable problem, so I can get
rid of that first fix:</p><blockquote class="code"><pre class="python"><div class="source"><span class="n">cols</span>&#xa0;<span class="o">=</span>&#xa0;<span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">N</span><span class="p">)</span>

</pre></blockquote><p>Once I had this working, I wondered why <code>product()</code> solved the
iterator/iterable problem.  The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.product" rel="external noopener">docs have a sample Python
implementation</a> that shows why: internally, <code>product()</code> is doing just
what my <code>list()</code> call did: it makes an explicit iterable from each of the
iterables it was passed, then picks values from them to make the pairs. This
lets <code>product()</code> accept iterators (like my reversed range) rather than
forcing the caller to always pass iterables.</p><p>If your head is spinning from all this iterable / iterator / iteration talk,
I don&#8217;t blame you.  Just now I said, &#8220;it makes an explicit iterable from each of
the iterables it was passed.&#8221; How does that make sense?  Well, an iterator is an
iterable.  So <code>product()</code> can take either a reusable iterable (like a range
or a list) or it can take a use-once iterator (like a reversed range).  Either
way, it populates its own reusable iterables internally.</p><p>Python&#8217;s iteration features are powerful but sometimes require careful
thinking to get right.  Don&#8217;t overlook the tools in itertools, and mind your
iterators and iterables!</p><p class="bulletsep">•    •    •</p><p>Some more notes:</p><p>1: Another way to reverse a range: you can slice them!</p><blockquote class="code"><pre class="python"><div class="source"><span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span>&#xa0;<span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">)</span>
<br /><span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span>&#xa0;<span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">)</span>
<br /><span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span>&#xa0;<span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">)[::</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]</span>
<br /><span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span>&#xa0;<span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span>&#xa0;<span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
<br /><span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span>&#xa0;<span class="nb">reversed</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">))</span>
<br /><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">range_iterator</span>&#xa0;<span class="nb">object</span>&#xa0;<span class="n">at</span>&#xa0;<span class="mh">0x10307cba0</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
<br /></div>
</pre></blockquote><p>It didn&#8217;t occur to me to reverse-slice the range, since <code>reversed</code> is
right there, but the slice gives you a new reusable range object while reversing
the range gives you a use-once iterator.</p><p>2: Why did <code>product()</code> explicitly store the values it would need but
<code>reversed</code> did not? Two reasons: first, <code>reversed()</code> depends on the
<code>__reversed__</code> dunder method, so it&#8217;s up to the original object to decide
how to implement it. Ranges know how to produce their values in backward order,
so they don&#8217;t need to store them all.  Second, <code>product()</code> is going to need
to use the values from each iterable many times and can&#8217;t depend on the
iterables being reusable.</p>
