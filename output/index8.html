        <div class="p-4 flex-grow overflow-hidden">
          <p class="text-base-content">
            <p>I felt like it might be a good time to write about some new things I&#8217;ve
learned.  Most of this is going to be about building agents, with a little bit
about using agentic coding tools.</p>
<p>TL;DR: Building agents is still messy.  SDK abstractions break once you hit
real tool use.  Caching works better when you manage it yourself, but differs
between models.  Reinforcement ends up doing more heavy lifting than expected,
and failures need strict isolation to avoid derailing the loop.  Shared state
via a file-system-like layer is an important building block.  Output tooling is
surprisingly tricky, and model choice still depends on the task.</p>
<h2>Which Agent SDK To Target?</h2>
<p>When you build your own agent, you have the choice of targeting an underlying
SDK like the OpenAI SDK or the Anthropic SDK, or you can go with a higher level
abstraction such as the Vercel AI SDK or Pydantic.  The choice we made a while
back was to adopt the Vercel AI SDK but only the provider abstractions, and to
basically <a href="https://ai-sdk.dev/cookbook/node/manual-agent-loop">drive the agent loop
ourselves</a>.  At this point
<a href="https://earendil.com/">we</a> would not make that choice again.  There is
absolutely nothing wrong with the Vercel AI SDK, but when you are trying to
build an agent, two things happen that we originally didn&#8217;t anticipate:</p>
<p>The first is that the differences between models are significant enough that
you will need to build your own agent abstraction.  We have not found any of
the solutions from these SDKs that build the right abstraction for an agent.  I
think this is partly because, despite the basic agent design being just a loop,
there are subtle differences based on the tools you provide.  These differences
affect how easy or hard it is to find the right abstraction (cache control,
different requirements for reinforcement, tool prompts, provider-side tools,
etc.).  Because the right abstraction is not yet clear, using the original SDKs
from the dedicated platforms keeps you fully in control.  With some of these
higher-level SDKs you have to build on top of their existing abstractions,
which might not be the ones you actually want in the end.</p>
<p>We also found it incredibly challenging to work with the Vercel SDK when it
comes to dealing with provider-side tools.  The attempted unification of
messaging formats doesn&#8217;t quite work.  For instance, the web search tool from
Anthropic routinely destroys the message history with the Vercel SDK, and we
haven&#8217;t yet fully figured out the cause.  Also, in Anthropic&#8217;s case, cache
management is much easier when targeting their SDK directly instead of the
Vercel one.  The error messages when you get things wrong are much clearer.</p>
<p>This might change, but right now we would probably not use an abstraction when
building an agent, at least until things have settled down a bit.  The benefits
do not yet outweigh the costs for us.</p>
<p>Someone else might have figured it out.  If you&#8217;re reading this and think I&#8217;m
wrong, please drop me a mail.  I want to learn.</p>
<h2>Caching Lessons</h2>
<p>The different platforms have very different approaches to caching.  A lot has
been said about this already, but Anthropic makes you pay for caching.  It
makes you manage cache points explicitly, and this really changes the way you
interact with it from an agent engineering level.  I initially found the manual
management pretty dumb.  Why doesn&#8217;t the platform do this for me?  But I&#8217;ve
fully come around and now vastly prefer explicit cache management.  It makes
costs and cache utilization much more predictable.</p>
<p>Explicit caching allows you to do certain things that are much harder
otherwise.  For instance, you can split off a conversation and have it run in
two different directions simultaneously.  You also have the opportunity to do
context editing.  The optimal strategy here is unclear, but you clearly have a
lot more control, and I really like having that control.  It also makes it much
easier to understand the cost of the underlying agent.  You can assume much
more about how well your cache will be utilized, whereas with other platforms
we found it to be hit and miss.</p>
<p>The way we do caching in the agent with Anthropic is pretty straightforward.
One cache point is after the system prompt.  Two cache points are placed at the
beginning of the conversation, where the last one moves up with the tail of the
conversation.  And then there is some optimization along the way that you can
do.</p>
<p>Because the system prompt and the tool selection now have to be mostly static,
we feed a dynamic message later to provide information such as the current
time.  Otherwise, this would trash the cache.  We also leverage reinforcement
during the loop much more.</p>
<h2>Reinforcement In The Agent Loop</h2>
<p>Every time the agent runs a tool you have the opportunity to not just return
data that the tool produces, but also to feed more information back into the
loop.  For instance, you can remind the agent about the overall objective and
the status of individual tasks.  You can also provide hints about how the tool
call might succeed when a tool fails.  Another use of reinforcement is to
inform the system about state changes that happened in the background.  If you
have an agent that uses parallel processing, you can inject information after
every tool call when that state changed and when it is relevant for completing
the task.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&#8217;s enough for the agent to self-reinforce.  In Claude Code, for
instance, the todo write tool is a self-reinforcement tool.  All it does is
take from the agent a list of tasks that it thinks it should do and echo out
what came in.  It&#8217;s basically just an echo tool; it really doesn&#8217;t do anything
else.  But that is enough to drive the agent forward better than if the only
task and subtask were given at the beginning of the context and too much has
happened in the meantime.</p>
<p>We also use reinforcements to inform the system if the environment changed
during execution in a way that&#8217;s problematic for the agent.  For instance, if
our agent fails and retries from a certain step forward but the recovery
operates off broken data, we inject a message informing it that it might want
to back off a couple of steps and redo an earlier step.</p>
<h2>Isolate Failures</h2>
<p>If you expect a lot of failures during code execution, there is an opportunity
to hide those failures from the context.  This can happen in two ways.  One is
to run tasks that might require iteration individually.  You would run them in
a subagent until they succeed and only report back the success, plus maybe a
brief summary of approaches that did not work.  It is helpful for an agent to
learn about what did not work in a subtask because it can then feed that
information into the next task to hopefully steer away from those failures.</p>
<p>The second option doesn&#8217;t exist in all agents or foundation models, but with
Anthropic you can do context editing.  So far we haven&#8217;t had a lot of success
with context editing, but we believe it&#8217;s an interesting thing we would love to
explore more.  We would also love to learn if people have success with it.
What is interesting about context editing is that you should be able to
preserve tokens for further down the iteration loop.  You can take out of the
context certain failures that didn&#8217;t drive towards successful completion of the
loop, but only negatively affected certain attempts during execution.  But as
with the point I made earlier: it is also useful for the agent to understand
what didn&#8217;t work, but maybe it doesn&#8217;t require the full state and full output
of all the failures.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, context editing will automatically invalidate caches.  There is
really no way around it.  So it can be unclear when the trade-off of doing that
compensates for the extra cost of trashing the cache.</p>
<h2>Sub Agents / Sub Inference</h2>
<p>As I mentioned a couple of times on this blog already, most of our agents are
based on code execution and code generation.  That really requires a common
place for the agent to store data.  Our choice is a file system—in our case a
virtual file system—but that requires different tools to access it.  This is
particularly important if you have something like a subagent or subinference.</p>
<p>You should try to build an agent that doesn&#8217;t have dead ends.  A dead end is
where a task can only continue executing within the sub-tool that you built.
For instance, you might build a tool that generates an image, but is only able
to feed that image back into one more tool.  That&#8217;s a problem because you might
then want to put those images into a zip archive using the code execution tool.
So there needs to be a system that allows the image generation tool to write
the image to the same place where the code execution tool can read it.  In
essence, that&#8217;s a file system.</p>
<p>Obviously it has to go the other way around too.  You might want to use the
code execution tool to unpack a zip archive and then go back to inference to
describe all the images so that the next step can go back to code execution and
so forth.  The file system is the mechanism that we use for that.  But it does
require tools to be built in a way that they can take file paths to the virtual
file system to work with.</p>
<p>So basically an <code>ExecuteCode</code> tool would have access to the same file system as
the <code>RunInference</code> tool which could take a <code>path</code> to a file on that same
virtual file system.</p>
<h2>The Use Of An Output Tool</h2>
<p>One interesting thing about how we structured our agent is that it does not
represent a chat session.  It will eventually communicate something to the user
or the outside world, but all the messages that it sends in between are usually
not revealed.  The question is: how does it create that message?  We have one
tool which is the output tool.  The agent uses it explicitly to communicate to
the human.  We then use a prompt to instruct it when to use that tool.  In our
case the output tool sends an email.</p>
<p>But that turns out to pose a few other challenges.  One is that it&#8217;s
surprisingly hard to steer the wording and tone of that output tool compared to
just using the main agent loop&#8217;s text output as the mechanism to talk to the
user.  I cannot say why this is, but I think it&#8217;s probably related to how these
models are trained.</p>
<p>One attempt that didn&#8217;t work well was to have the output tool run another quick
LLM like Gemini 2.5 Flash to adjust the tone to our preference.  But this
increases latency and actually reduces the quality of the output.  In part, I
think the model just doesn&#8217;t word things correctly and the subtool doesn&#8217;t have
sufficient context.  Providing more slices of the main agentic context into the
subtool makes it expensive and also didn&#8217;t fully solve the problem.  It also
sometimes reveals information in the final output that we didn&#8217;t want to be
there, like the steps that led to the end result.</p>
<p>Another problem with an output tool is that sometimes it just doesn&#8217;t call the
tool.  One of the ways in which we&#8217;re forcing this is we remember if the output
tool was called.  If the loop ends without the output tool, we inject a
reinforcement message to encourage it to use the output tool.</p>
<h2>Model Choice</h2>
<p>Overall our choices for models haven&#8217;t dramatically changed so far.  I think
Haiku and Sonnet are still the best tool callers available, so they make for
excellent choices in the agent loop.  They are also somewhat transparent with
regards to what the RL looks like.  The other obvious choices are the Gemini
models.  We so far haven&#8217;t found a ton of success with the GPT family of models
for the main loop.</p>
<p>For the individual sub-tools, which in part might also require inference, our
current choice is Gemini 2.5 if you need to summarize large documents or work
with PDFs and things like that.  That is also a pretty good model for
extracting information from images, in particular because the Sonnet family of
models likes to run into a safety filter which can be annoying.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also probably the very obvious realization that token cost alone
doesn&#8217;t really define how expensive an agent.  A better tool caller will do the
job in fewer tokens.  There are some cheaper models available than sonnet
today, but they are not <em>necessarily</em> cheaper in a loop.</p>
<p>But all things considered, not that much has changed in the last couple of
weeks.</p>
<h2>Testing and Evals</h2>
<p>We find testing and evals to be the hardest problem here.  This is not entirely
surprising, but the agentic nature makes it even harder.  Unlike prompts, you
cannot just do the evals in some external system because there&#8217;s too much you
need to feed into it.  This means you want to do evals based on observability
data or instrumenting your actual test runs.  So far none of the solutions we
have tried have convinced us that they found the right approach here.
Unfortunately, I have to report that at the moment we haven&#8217;t found something
that really makes us happy.  I hope we&#8217;re going to find a solution for this
because it is becoming an increasingly frustrating aspect of building an agent.</p>
<h2>Coding Agent Updates</h2>
<p>As for my experience with coding agents, not really all that much has changed.
The main new development is that I&#8217;m trialing <a href="https://ampcode.com/">Amp</a> more.
In case you&#8217;re curious why: it&#8217;s not that it&#8217;s objectively a better agent than
what I&#8217;m using, but I really quite like the way they&#8217;re thinking about agents
from what they&#8217;re posting.  The interactions of the different sub agents like
the Oracle with the main loop is beautifully done, and not many other harnesses
do this today.  It&#8217;s also a good way for me to validate how different agent
designs work.  Amp, similar to Claude Code, really feels like a product built
by people who also use their own tool.  I do not feel every other agent in the
industry does this.</p>
<h2>Quick Stuff I Read And Found</h2>
<p>That&#8217;s just a random assortment of things that I feel might also be worth
sharing:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://mariozechner.at/posts/2025-11-02-what-if-you-dont-need-mcp/">What if you don&#8217;t need MCP at
all?</a>:
Mario argues that many MCP servers are overengineered and include large
toolsets that consume lots of context.  He proposes a minimalist approach for
browser-agent use-cases by relying on simple CLI tools (e.g., start, navigate,
evaluate JS, screenshot) executed via Bash, which keeps token usage small and

<p><a href="https://us.pycon.org/2026/" rel="nofollow">PyCon US 2026 is coming to Long Beach, California</a>!
PyCon US is the premiere conference for the Python programming language
in North America. Python experts and enthusiasts from around the globe
will gather in Long Beach to discuss and learn about the latest developments
to the Python programming language and massive ecosystem of Python projects.</p>
<div class="markdown-heading"><h2 class="heading-element">New in 2026: Security and AI talk tracks!</h2><a class="anchor" href="https://gist.github.com/sethmlarson/54e5da4479feb96d83297cbe94c6242f/edit#new-in-2026-security-and-ai-talk-tracks" id="user-content-new-in-2026-security-and-ai-talk-tracks"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a></div>
<p>Brand new this year are two themed talk tracks: “<b>Trailblazing Python Security</b>” and “<b>Python and the Future of AI</b>”.
<i>We want to hear talks from you!</i> The PyCon US <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2026/speaking/guidelines/" rel="nofollow">Call for Proposals (CFP) for PyCon US 2026</a> is now open through <b>December 19th, 2025</b>.
Don’t wait to submit your talks, the earlier you submit the better.</p><p>If your company or organization would like to show support for a more
 secure Python ecosystem by sponsoring the “Trailblazing Python

<p>If you're interested in Python and security: <b>why
should you attend PyCon US 2026?</b></p>
<p>Many Pythonistas use the Open Source software available on the <a href="https://blog.pypi.org/" rel="nofollow">Python Package Index</a> (PyPI).
PyCon US is the flagship conference hosted by the <a href="https://www.python.org/psf-landing/" rel="nofollow">Python Software Foundation</a>, the stewards of
the Python Package Index. Many brand-new security features are announced and demoed live
at PyCon US, such as “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsY5k1wLJpI" rel="nofollow">PyPI Digital Attestations</a>”,
“<a href="https://blog.pypi.org/posts/2023-04-23-introducing-pypi-organizations/" rel="nofollow">PyPI Organizations</a>”, and “<a href="https://blog.pypi.org/posts/2023-04-20-introducing-trusted-publishers/" rel="nofollow">Trusted Publishers</a>”.</p>
<p>You’ll be among the first Pythonistas to hear about these new features and chat with the developers and maintainers of PyPI.</p>

</td></tr></tbody></table><p>PyCon US always has many opportunities to learn about the latest in Python security. Last year at PyCon US 2025 hosted a “<a href="https://sethmlarson.dev/pycon-us-2025-security-mini-summit#supply-chain-security-mini-track" rel="nofollow">Python Security Mini-Summit</a>”
 Open Space with speakers discussing the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA), CVE
 and Open Source, and supply-chain within the Scientific Python 
community. Expect even more security content this year!</p>
<p>The conference talk schedule includes many talks about using 
memory-safe systems programming languages like Rust with Python, 
authentication with popular Web frameworks, how to handle security 
vulnerabilities as an Open Source project, and how the “Phantom 
Dependency” problem affects the Python package ecosystem.</p>
<p>We hope you’ll consider <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2026/" rel="nofollow">joining us</a> in Long Beach, CA for PyCon US 2026. <b>See you there!</b> 🔥🏕️</p></div>

            <p>In <a href="https://nedbatchelder.com/blog/201908/why_your_mock_doesnt_work">Why your mock doesn’t work</a> I explained this rule of
mocking:</p><blockquote><div><p>Mock where the object is used, <strong>not</strong> where it&#8217;s
defined.</p></div></blockquote><p>That blog post explained why that rule was important: often a mock doesn&#8217;t
work at all if you do it wrong.  But in some cases, the mock will work even if
you don&#8217;t follow this rule, and then it can break much later. Why?</p><p>Let&#8217;s say you have code like this:</p><blockquote class="code"><div class="source"><pre class="python"><span class="c1">#&#xa0;user.py</span>
<br />
<br /><span class="k">def</span><span class="w">&#xa0;</span><span class="nf">get_user_settings</span><span class="p">():</span>

<br />
<br /><span class="k">def</span><span class="w">&#xa0;</span><span class="nf">add_two_settings</span><span class="p">():</span>

<br /></pre></div>
</blockquote><p>You write a simple test:</p><blockquote class="code"><div class="source"><pre class="python"><span class="k">def</span><span class="w">&#xa0;</span><span class="nf">test_add_two_settings</span><span class="p">():</span>
<br />&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;<span class="c1">#&#xa0;NOTE:&#xa0;need&#xa0;to&#xa0;create&#xa0;~/settings.json&#xa0;for&#xa0;this&#xa0;to&#xa0;work:</span>
<br />&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;<span class="c1">#&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;{&quot;opt1&quot;:&#xa0;10,&#xa0;&quot;opt2&quot;:&#xa0;7}</span>
<br />&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;<span class="k">assert</span>&#xa0;<span class="n">add_two_settings</span><span class="p">()</span>&#xa0;<span class="o">==</span>&#xa0;<span class="mi">17</span>
<br /></pre></div>
</blockquote><p>As the comment in the test points out, the test will only pass if you create
the correct settings.json file in your home directory. This is bad: you don&#8217;t
want to require finicky environments for your tests to pass.</p><p>The thing we want to avoid is opening a real file, so it&#8217;s a natural impulse
to mock out <code>open()</code>:</p><blockquote class="code"><div class="source"><pre class="python"><span class="c1">#&#xa0;test_user.py</span>

</blockquote><p>What happened!? Coverage.py code runs during your tests, invoked by the
Python interpreter.  The mock in the test changed the builtin <code>open</code>, so
any use of it anywhere during the test is affected. In some cases, coverage.py
needs to read your source code to record the execution properly.  When that
happens, coverage.py unknowingly uses the mocked <code>open</code>, and bad things
happen.</p><p>When you use a mock, patch it where it&#8217;s used, not where it&#8217;s defined.  In
this case, the patch would be:</p><blockquote class="code"><div class="source"><pre class="python"><span class="nd">@patch</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;myproduct.user.open&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<br /><span class="k">def</span><span class="w">&#xa0;</span><span class="nf">test_add_two_settings</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">mock_open</span><span class="p">):</span>
<br />&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;<span class="o">...</span>&#xa0;<span class="n">etc</span>&#xa0;<span class="o">...</span>
<br /></pre></div>
</blockquote><p>With a mock like this, the coverage.py code would be unaffected.</p><p>Keep in mind: it&#8217;s not just coverage.py that could trip over this mock. There
could be other libraries used by your code, or you might use <code>open</code>
yourself in another part of your product.  Mocking the definition means
<em>anything</em> using the object will be affected.  Your intent is to only
mock in one place, so target that place.</p><h1 id="h_postscript">Postscript<a class="headerlink" href="#h_postscript"></a></h1><p>I decided to add some code to coverage.py to defend against this kind of
over-mocking.  There is <a href="https://github.com/search?type=code&amp;q=patch+builtins.open+language%3APython+path%3A%22test%22" rel="external noopener">a lot of over-mocking out
there</a>, and this problem only shows up in coverage.py with Python 3.14. It&#8217;s
not happening to many people yet, but it will happen more and more as people
start testing with 3.14. I didn&#8217;t want to have to answer this question many
times, and I didn&#8217;t want to force people to fix their mocks.</p><p>From a certain perspective, I shouldn&#8217;t have to do this. They are in the
wrong, not me.  But this will reduce the overall friction in the universe. And
<a href="https://github.com/coveragepy/coveragepy/commit/961fc5b4a1c40bec6e0d1908b6fb43b84a5d8c6b#diff-7a060a25115604cc3bc99075e1366afb84075101dcb0aef22d80f8f67c0c4593R30" rel="external noopener">the fix</a> was really simple:</p><blockquote class="code"><div class="source"><pre class="python"><span class="nb">open</span>&#xa0;<span class="o">=</span>&#xa0;<span class="nb">open</span>
<br /></pre></div>
</blockquote><p>This is a top-level statement in my module, so it runs when the module is
imported, long before any tests are run.  The assignment to <code>open</code> will
create a global in my module, using the current value of <code>open</code>, the one
found in the builtins. This saves the original <code>open</code> for use in my module
later, isolated from how builtins might be changed later.</p><p>This is an ad-hoc fix: it only defends one builtin. Mocking other builtins
could still break coverage.py.  But <code>open</code> is a common one, and this will
keep things working smoothly for those cases. And there&#8217;s precedent: I&#8217;ve
already been using a more involved technique to <a href="https://github.com/coveragepy/coveragepy/commit/3b8f4a0b86f8796f1e7925b9c6593a9d5198b437" rel="external noopener">defend
against mocking of the <code>os</code> module</a> for ten years.</p><h1 id="h_even_better">Even better!<a class="headerlink" href="#h_even_better"></a></h1><p>No blog post about mocking is complete without encouraging a number of other
best practices, some of which could get you out of the mocking mess:</p><ul>

<li>Use <code>autospec=True</code> to make your mocks strictly behave like the
original object: see <a href="https://nedbatchelder.com/blog/202202/why_your_mock_still_doesnt_work">Why your mock still doesn’t work</a>.</li>

<li>Make assertions about how your mock was called to be sure everything is
connected up properly.</li>

<li>Use verified fakes instead of auto-generated mocks: <a href="https://pythonspeed.com/articles/verified-fakes/" rel="external noopener">Fast
tests for slow services: why you should use verified fakes</a>.</li>

<li>Separate your code so that computing functions like our
<code>add_two_settings</code> don&#8217;t also do I/O. This makes the functions easier to
test in the first place. Take a look at <a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts/catalog/functional-core-imperative-shell" rel="external noopener">Function Core,
Imperative Shell</a>.</li>

<li>Dependency injection lets you explicitly pass test-specific objects where
they are needed instead of relying on implicit access to a mock.</li>

            <p>The <a href="http://python.org/psf" target="_blank">Python Software Foundation</a> (PSF) is the charitable organization behind Python, dedicated to advancing, supporting, and protecting the Python programming language and the community that sustains it. That mission and cause are more than just words we believe in. Our tiny but mighty team works hard to deliver the projects and services that allow Python to be the thriving, independent, community-driven language it is today. Some of what the PSF does includes producing <a href="https://us.pycon.org" target="_blank">PyCon US</a>, hosting the <a href="http://pypi.org" target="_blank">Python Package Index (PyPI)</a>, supporting <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/developersinresidence/" target="_blank">5 Developers-in-Residence</a>, <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/about/" target="_blank">maintaining critical community infrastructure</a>, and more.<br /><br />Python is for teaching, learning, playing, researching, exploring, creating, working– the list goes on and on and on! Support this year's fundraiser with your donations and memberships to help the PSF, the Python community, and the language stay strong and sustainable. <b>Because Python is for everyone, thanks to you.<br /><br /></b></p><h3 style="text-align: left;">There are two direct ways to join through <a href="http://donate.python.org">donate.python.org</a>:&nbsp;</h3><ul style="text-align: left;"><li><b>Donate directly to the PSF!</b> Your donation is a direct way to support and power the future of the Python programming language and community you love.

Lawrence Convention Center in beautiful downtown Pittsburgh. PyCon US 2025 was packed with 9 days of content, education, and networking for the Python community, including 6 Keynote Sessions, 91 Talks, including the Charlas Spanish track, 24 Tutorials, 20 Posters, 30+ Sprint Projects, 146 Open Spaces, and 60 Booths!&nbsp;</li><li><b>Continuing to enhance Python and PyPI’s security through Developers-in-Residence:</b> The PSF’s PyPI Safety and Security Engineer, Mike Fiedler, has implemented new safeguards, including automation to detect expiring email domains and prevent impersonation attacks, as well as guidance for maintainers to use more secure authentication methods like WebAuthn and Trusted Publishers. The PSF’s Security Developer-in-Residence, Seth Larson, continues to lead efforts to strengthen Python’s security and transparency. His work on PEP 770 introduces standardized Software Bill-of-Materials (SBOMs) within Python packages, improving visibility into dependencies for stronger supply chain security. A <a href="https://alpha-omega.dev/blog/slippery-zips-and-sticky-tar-pits-security-and-archives-white-paper-by-seth-larson-python-software-foundation/" target="_blank">new white paper co-authored with Alpha-Omega</a> outlines how these improvements enhance trust and measurability across the ecosystem.&nbsp;</li><li><b>Adoption of <a href="http://pypistats.org">pypistats.org</a>:</b> The <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2025/08/pypistats-org-is-now-operated-by-the-psf.html" target="_blank">PSF infrastructure team has officially adopted the operation of pypistats.org</a>, which had been run by volunteer Christopher Flynn for over six years (thank you, Christopher!). The PSF’s Infrastructure Team now handles the service’s infrastructure, costs, and domain registration– and the service itself remains open source and community-maintained.&nbsp;</li><li><b>Advancing PyPI Organizations:</b> The rollout of <a href="https://docs.pypi.org/organization-accounts/" target="_blank">PyPI Organizations</a> is now well underway, marking a major milestone in improving project management and collaboration across the Python ecosystem. With new Terms of Service finalized and supporting tools in place, the PSF has cleared its backlog of requests and approved thousands of organizations—including 2,409 Community and 4979 Company organizations as of today. Hundreds of these organizations have already begun adding members, transferring projects, and subscribing to the new Company tier, generating sustainable support for the PSF. We’re excited to see how teams are using these new features to better organize and maintain their projects on PyPI.</li><li><b>Empowering the Python community through Fiscal Sponsorship:</b> We are proud to continue supporting our 20 fiscal sponsoree organizations with their initiatives and events all year round. The PSF provides 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status to fiscal sponsorees such as PyLadies and Pallets, and provides back office support so they can focus on their missions. Consider <a href="https://linktr.ee/thepsf" target="_blank">donating to your favorite PSF Fiscal Sponsoree</a> and check out our <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/fiscal-sponsorees/" target="_blank">Fiscal Sponsorees page</a> to learn more about what each of these awesome organizations is all about!</li><li><b>Serving our community with grants:</b> The PSF Grants Program awarded approximately $340K to 86 grantees around the world; supporting local conferences, workshops, and community initiatives that keep Python growing and accessible to all. While we had to make <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2025/08/the-psf-has-paused-our-grants-program.html" target="_blank">the difficult decision to pause the program early</a> to ensure financial sustainability, we would love to reopen it as soon as possible. Your participation in this year’s fundraiser fuels that effort!</li><li><b>Honoring community leaders:</b> The PSF honored three leaders with Distinguished Service Awards this year. <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2025/03/psf-dsa-ewa-jodlowska.html" target="_blank">Ewa Jodlowska</a> helped transform the PSF into a professional, globally supportive organization. <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2025/03/dsa-thomas-wouters.html" target="_blank">Thomas Wouters</a> has contributed decades of leadership, guidance, and institutional knowledge. <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2025/03/dsa-van-lindberg.html" target="_blank">Van Lindberg</a> provided essential legal expertise that guided the PSF through growth and governance. Their dedication has left a lasting impact on the PSF, Python, and its community.&nbsp;The PSF was also thrilled to recognize <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2025/10/announcing-psf-community-service-award.html" target="_blank">Katie McLaughlin, Sarah Kuchinsky, and Rodrigo Girão Serrão with Community Service Awards</a>&nbsp;(CSA) for their outstanding contributions to the Python community. Their dedication, creativity, and generosity embody the spirit of Python and strengthen our global community.&nbsp;We recognized Jay Miller with a CSA for his work to improve diversity, inclusion, and equity in the global Python community through founding and sustaining Black Python Devs. We also honored Matt Lebrun and Micaela Reyes with CSA's for their efforts to grow and support the Python community in the Philippines through conferences, meetups, and volunteer programs.</li><li><b>Finding strength in the Python community:</b> When the PSF shared <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2025/10/NSF-funding-statement.html" target="_blank">the news about turning down a NSF grant</a>, the outpouring of support from the Python community was nothing short of incredible. In just one day, you helped raise over $60K and welcomed 125 new Supporting Members- in the week after, that number jumped to $150K+ and 270+ new Supporting Members! A community-led matching campaign and countless messages of support, solidarity, and encouragement reminded us that while some choices are tough, we never face them alone. The PSF Board &amp; Staff are deeply moved and energized by your words, actions, and continued belief in our shared mission. This moment has set the stage for a record-breaking end-of-year fundraiser, and we are so incredibly grateful to be in community with each of you.&nbsp;</li></ul>

    <h2>Parentheses can be used for grouping</h2>
    
      
        <p>Parentheses are used for 3 things in Python: <strong>calling callables</strong>, <strong>creating empty tuples</strong>, and <strong>grouping</strong>.</p>

      
        <p>Functions, classes, and other [callable][] objects can be called with parentheses:</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"I'm calling a function"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">I'm calling a function</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>Empty tuples can be created with parentheses:</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">empty</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">()</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>Lastly, parentheses can be used for <strong>grouping</strong>:</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="mi">3</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">4</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">7</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">33</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>Sometimes parentheses are <em>necessary</em> to convey the order of execution for an expression.
For example, <code>3 * (4 + 7)</code> is different than <code>3 * 4 + 7</code>:</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="mi">3</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">4</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">7</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">33</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="mi">3</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">4</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">7</span>
<span class="go">19</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>Those parentheses around <code>4 + 7</code> are for grouping that sub-expression, which changes the meaning of the larger expression.</p>

      
        <p>All confusing and unnecessary uses of parentheses are caused by this third use: <strong>grouping parentheses</strong>.</p>

            This blog post was brought to you by Damaso Sanoja, draft.dev. Deciding whether to use Python or Rust isn’t just a syntax choice; it’s a career bet. According to the StackOverflow Developer Survey, Python dominates in accessibility, with 66.4% of people learning to code choosing it as their entry point. Python usage skyrocketed from 32% [&#8230;]

            Today we’re digging into the Model Context Protocol, or MCP. Think LSP for AI: build a small Python service once and your tools and data show up across editors and agents like VS Code, Claude Code, and more. My guest, Den Delimarsky from Microsoft, helps build this space and will keep us honest about what’s solid versus what's just shiny. We’ll keep it practical: transports that actually work, guardrails you can trust, and a tiny server you could ship this week. By the end, you’ll have a clear mental model and a path to plug Python into the internet of agents.

            <p>It&#8217;s been a busy, bumpy week with coverage.py. Some things did not go
smoothly, and I didn&#8217;t handle everything as well as I could have.</p><p>It started with trying to fix <a href="https://github.com/coveragepy/coveragepy/issues/2064" rel="external noopener">issue 2064</a> about
conflicts between the &#8220;sysmon&#8221; measurement core and a concurrency setting.</p><p>To measure your code, coverage.py needs to know what code got executed. To
know that, it collects execution events from the Python interpreter. CPython now
has two mechanisms for this: trace functions and sys.monitoring.  Coverage.py
has two implementations of a trace function (in C and in Python), and an
implementation of a sys.monitoring listener.  These three components are the
measurement cores, known as &#8220;ctrace&#8221;, &#8220;pytrace&#8221;, and &#8220;sysmon&#8221;.</p><p>The fastest is sysmon, but there are coverage.py features it doesn&#8217;t yet
support.  With Python 3.14, sysmon is the default core.  Issue 2064 complained
that when the defaulted core conflicted with an explicit concurrency choice, the
conflict resulted in an error.  I agreed with the issue: since the core was
defaulted, it shouldn&#8217;t be an error, we should choose a different core.</p><p>But I figured if you explicitly asked for the sysmon core and also a
conflicting setting, that should be an error because you&#8217;ve got two settings
that can&#8217;t be used together.</p><p>Implementing all that got a little involved because of &#8220;metacov&#8221;: coverage.py
coverage-measuring itself.  The sys.monitoring facility in Python was added in
3.12, but wasn&#8217;t fully fleshed out enough to do branch coverage until 3.14. When
we measure ourselves, we use branch coverage, so 3.12 and 3.13 needed some
special handling to avoid causing the error that sysmon plus branch coverage
would cause.</p><p>I got it all done, and <a href="https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/7.11.3/changes.html#version-7-11-1-2025-11-07" rel="external noopener">released 7.11.1</a> on Friday.</p><p>Soon, <a href="https://github.com/coveragepy/coveragepy/issues/2077" rel="external noopener">issue 2077</a> arrived. Another fix in 7.11.1
involved some missing branches when using the sysmon core.  That fix required
parsing the source code during execution.  But sometimes the &#8220;code&#8221; can&#8217;t be
parsed: Jinja templates compile html files to Python and use the html file as
the file name for the code. When coverage.py tries to parse the html file as
Python, of course it fails. My fix didn&#8217;t account for this.  I fixed that on
Saturday and <a href="https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/7.11.3/changes.html#version-7-11-2-2025-11-08" rel="external noopener">released 7.11.2</a>.</p><p>In the meantime, <a href="https://github.com/coveragepy/coveragepy/issues/2076" rel="external noopener">issue 2076</a> and <a href="https://github.com/coveragepy/coveragepy/issues/2078" rel="external noopener">issue
2078</a> both pointed out that now some settings combinations that used to
produce warnings now produced errors. This is a breaking change, they said, and
should not have been released as a patch version.</p><p>To be honest, my first reaction was that it wasn&#8217;t that big a deal, the
settings were in conflict. Fix the settings and all will be well.  It&#8217;s hard to
remember all of the possibilities when making changes like this, it&#8217;s easy to
make mistakes, and semantic versioning is bound to have judgement calls anyway.
I had already spent a while getting 7.11.1 done, and .2 followed just a day
later. I was annoyed and didn&#8217;t want to have to re-think everything.</p><p>But the more I thought about it, I decided they were right: it does break
pipelines that used to work.  And falling back to a different core is fine: the
cores differ in speed and compatibility but (for the most part) produce the same
results. Changing the requested core with a warning is a fine way to deal with
the settings conflict without stopping test suites from running.</p><p>So I just <a href="https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/7.11.3/changes.html#version-7-11-3-2025-11-09" rel="external noopener">released 7.11.3</a> to go back to the older
behavior. Maybe I won&#8217;t have to do another release tomorrow!</p><p>While all this was going on, I also moved the code from my personal GitHub
account to a new <a href="https://github.com/coveragepy" rel="external noopener">coveragepy GitHub
organization</a>!</p><p>Coverage.py is basically a one-man show. Maybe the GitHub organization will
make others feel more comfortable chiming in, but I doubt it. I&#8217;d like to have
more people to talk through changes with.  Maybe I wouldn&#8217;t have had to make
three releases in three days if someone else had been around as a sounding
board.</p><p>I&#8217;m in the <a href="https://discord.gg/RBw567RyWc" rel="external noopener">#coverage-py</a> channel if you want to talk
about any aspect of coverage.py, or I can be reached in
<a href="https://nedbatchelder.com/site/aboutned">lots of other ways</a>. I&#8217;d love to talk to
you.</p>
