  <strong>Introduction</strong>
</h1>

<p>Every developer has that one project that started as a personal solution and unexpectedly found a life of its own. For me, that was <a href="https://github.com/cleder/fastkml" rel="noopener noreferrer">FastKML</a>, a library I built in 2012 to “scratch my own itch.” I needed to embed maps into a website, and at the time, <a href="https://developers.google.com/kml" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>KML</strong></a> was the de facto standard for visualizing geospatial data on the web. <a href="https://geojson.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">GeoJSON</a> existed but was still in its infancy and unsupported by <a href="https://openlayers.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenLayers</a>, which was then the best tool for embedding maps.</p>

<p>Other Python libraries for KML existed, but most were either limited in scope, lacked Python 3 support, or didn’t meet my performance needs. Performance was crucial, so I built <strong>FastKML</strong> using <code>lxml</code> instead of the slower XML DOM used by many contemporaries.</p>

<p>As FastKML evolved, it depended on <a href="https://github.com/shapely/shapely" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shapely</a> for geometry handling, an excellent library, but one that required C extensions and added installation complexity. That led to the birth of <a href="https://github.com/cleder/pygeoif" rel="noopener noreferrer">PyGeoIf</a>, a pure Python implementation of basic geospatial objects. PyGeoIf aimed to serve as a lightweight, dependency-free substitute for Shapely when users didn’t need all of its advanced geometry operations. The API mirrored Shapely’s closely, making migration as simple as replacing<br />

</div>



<p>Over the years, both projects aged gracefully, but not without technical debt. They bore the marks of an earlier Python era: Python 2/3 compatibility hacks (at the very beginning Python 2.6 was still in use), missing type hints, and occasionally ambiguous function signatures.</p>

<p>Still, they worked. The test coverage exceeded 95%, bugs were rare, and they continued solving real problems for users long after I had moved on to other roles outside GIS. To my surprise, the packages remained popular; downloads were steady, and employers still asked about them. But I knew the code looked dated, and if I had to review it today, it wouldn’t pass.</p>

<p>Fast forward to 2020. The geospatial landscape had changed; <strong>GeoJSON</strong> had overtaken KML, Python’s ecosystem had matured, and I had learned a great deal about clean code and maintainability. It was time to modernize these legacy projects for the new decade.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  The Need for Change
</h2>

<p>Modernization wasn’t just a matter of adding type hints or updating syntax, it was about bringing two long-lived projects in line with modern development practices. The original codebases had served well for years, but they were increasingly difficult to extend. Function signatures were ambiguous, internal logic was tangled, and adding new features often caused <em>shotgun surgery</em>, requiring edits across multiple unrelated files.</p>

<p>The <strong>Shapely</strong> API had evolved too, fully embracing <strong>PEP 8</strong> naming conventions and adopting more expressive methods. To remain compatible, PyGeoIf needed to evolve alongside it. Meanwhile, Python itself had transformed: type hints, static analysis, and property-based testing were now standard practice rather than novelty.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Drivers of Change
</h3>

<p>The single most important motivator was the <strong>introduction of type hints</strong> in Python. Type annotations have revolutionized how Python code is written, reviewed, and maintained, enhancing readability and catching subtle bugs early through tools like <strong>mypy</strong>.<br />
The first step was static analysis with tools like mypy, which immediately flagged legacy Python 2 compatibility hacks, ambiguous function signatures, and missing type hints. Extending the tests in tandem ensured that each refactor preserved correctness.</p>

<p>Beyond that, the desire for clearer APIs, more maintainable structures, and modern testing techniques pushed the modernization effort forward. I wanted code that not only worked but was <strong>readable, testable, and future-proof</strong>.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  A Tale of Two Refactors
</h3>

<p>For <strong>PyGeoIf</strong>, version 0.7 had been released in 2017. Four years later, in September 2021, I published the first beta of the 1.0 series: fully type-annotated, statically checked with <code>mypy</code>, and tested using <strong>property-based testing</strong> with <a href="https://hypothesis.works/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hypothesis</a> and improved tests with <strong>mutation testing</strong> with <a href="https://mutmut.readthedocs.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer">MutMut</a>. By September 2022, version 1.0 was stable, and by October 2025, it had matured to version 1.5.</p>

<p>For <strong>FastKML</strong>, after a long silence since version 0.11 in 2015, I released version 0.12 in September 2021, incorporating long-neglected pull requests and minor improvements. A month later came <strong>FastKML 1.0 alpha 1</strong> on PyPI. What I thought would be a quick release became an 18-iteration journey spanning three years, culminating in <strong>version 1.0</strong> in November 2024; finally the library I had envisioned years earlier.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Reflecting on Contributions and Community Support
</h2>

<p>Over the past few years of developing <strong>PyGeoIf</strong> and <strong>FastKML</strong>, the journey has been shaped not only by personal effort but also by the support and engagement of the open-source community. One striking example of this has been <strong>Hacktoberfest contributions</strong> which consistently provided motivation and tangible progress.</p>

<p>These contributions may seem small individually, but collectively they have <strong>kept the momentum going</strong>. Seeing community members engage with the projects during Hacktoberfest has been a <strong>continuing source of encouragement</strong>, reminding me that every bit of contribution helps make the software more robust, maintainable, and welcoming to others.</p>

<p>The positive impact goes beyond the specific changes. Hacktoberfest contributions have:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Encouraged ongoing improvement</strong> by motivating incremental updates.</li>
<li>
<strong>Highlighted the value of community participation</strong> in maintaining and modernizing open-source projects.</li>
<li>
<strong>Reinforced a sense of shared purpose</strong>, showing that even small efforts can collectively advance a project.</li>
</ul>

<p>This ongoing collaboration has made the development process <strong>more rewarding and sustainable</strong>, reinforcing a simple but powerful lesson: in open-source, community engagement isn’t just about code, it’s about inspiration and momentum.</p>

<p>Hacktoberfest contributions aren’t just code, they’re <strong>encouragement</strong>. They spark incremental improvements, highlight the value of shared effort, and inspire continued development. Seeing others invest their time and ideas in these projects has been a <strong>constant source of motivation</strong> to keep improving, testing, and refining.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Hacktoberfest and the Power of Community
</h2>

<p>Developing <strong>PyGeoIf</strong> and <strong>FastKML</strong> has been a journey of learning, coding, and refining, but it’s the <strong>community contributions</strong>, especially during Hacktoberfest, that have truly kept the momentum alive.</p>

<p>October has consistently brought a wave of engagement: pre-commit hooks, bug fixes, minor enhancements, and automated improvements. Each contribution, no matter how small, <strong>reinforced the sense of progress</strong> and reminded me that open-source thrives on collaboration.</p>

<p>Looking forward, this collaborative energy continues to <strong>fuel future features and refinements</strong>. Hacktoberfest has proven that even small contributions can make a big difference, both in the code and in the spirit of the community.</p>

            <p>Greetings, Pythonistas- thank you so much for supporting the work of the PSF and the Python community! The newest PSF Board has decided to continue investing in connecting with the global Python community by running the PSF Board Office Hour sessions on the <a href="https://discord.gg/4Hm36PPgpG" target="_blank">PSF Discord</a> into 2026.&nbsp;<br /><br />We began running these sessions in September 2024, and they have proven to be a great method for the community to connect with the board and vice versa. The sessions have provided the PSF Board and Staff the opportunity to hear what our community is up to and what challenges they are facing, as well as receive invaluable feedback about how the PSF can continue to improve our service to the Python community.&nbsp;<br /></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">What are the PSF Board Office Hours?</h2><p>During the PSF Board Office Hours, you can participate in a <b>text-based live chat</b> with PSF Board Directors. This is a chance to connect, share, and collaborate with the PSF Board and Staff to improve our community together. Occasionally, we will have dedicated topics such as PyCon US and the PSF Board Elections for the office hour sessions.&nbsp;<br /><br />Here is some of the work that we collaborate with staff and volunteers on:<br /><br /></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Promotion and outreach for the Python programming language</li><li>Supporting local Python communities</li><li>Organizing PyCon US</li><li>Diversity and Inclusion in our community</li><li>Support handling Code of Conduct issues within our communities</li><li>Furthering <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/mission/" target="_blank">the mission of the PSF</a></li></ul><p style="text-align: left;"><br />Unless we have a dedicated topic for a session, you are not limited to talking with us about the above topics, although the discussions should be focused on Python, the PSF, and our community. If you think there’s something we can help with or we should know, we welcome you to come and talk to us!<br /></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Joining the office hours</h2><p>The office hour sessions will take place on the PSF Discord server in the #psf-board channel. If you are new to Discord, make sure to check out <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360033931551-Getting-Started" target="_blank">a tutorial on how you can download the app and sign up for free</a>– then join us on the <a href="https://discord.gg/4Hm36PPgpG" target="_blank">PSF Discord</a>! To make the office hours more accessible, the office hours will be scheduled at alternating times, so no matter where you are based, you can find a time that is most convenient for you! Here is a list of the dates and times:</p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>November 4th, 2 pm UTC</li><li>December 9th, 9 pm UTC</li><li>January 13th, 2 pm UTC&nbsp;</li><li>February 10th, 9 pm UTC</li><li>March 10th, 1 pm UTC&nbsp;</li><li>April 14th, 9 pm UTC</li><li>May 12th, 1 pm UTC&nbsp;</li><li>June 9th, 9 pm UTC</li><li>July 14th, 1 pm UTC&nbsp;</li><li>August 11th, 9 pm UTC</li><li>September 8th, 1 pm UTC&nbsp;</li><li>October 13th, 9 pm UTC</li></ul><p><br />Each session lasts for an hour. Sessions after October 2026 will be announced in the future.<br /></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Who will be at the office hours?</h2><p>Some board members of the PSF will be attending each office hour, as well as members of the PSF Staff. The <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/board/#id33" target="_blank">list of the current PSF Board Directors</a> can be found on our website. We are passionate Python community members who are excited to listen, help, and provide support to you. We are happy to follow up with you if there are any issues we cannot address immediately during the office hour sessions. As always, you can email us at psf-board@python.org with inquiries, feedback, or comments any time.&nbsp;</p>

        <div class="p-4 flex-grow overflow-hidden">
          <p class="text-base-content">
            <p>In January 2025, the PSF submitted a proposal to the US government National Science Foundation under the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/safe-ose-safety-security-privacy-open-source-ecosystems" target="_blank">Safety, Security, and Privacy of Open Source Ecosystems program</a> to address structural vulnerabilities in Python and PyPI. It was the PSF’s first time applying for government funding, and navigating the intensive process was a steep learning curve for our small team to climb. Seth Larson, PSF Security Developer in Residence, serving as Principal Investigator (PI) with Loren Crary, PSF Deputy Executive Director, as co-PI, led the multi-round proposal writing process as well as the months-long vetting process. We invested our time and effort because we felt the PSF’s work is a strong fit for the program and that the benefit to the community if our proposal were accepted was considerable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div><div>We were honored when, after many months of work, our proposal was recommended for funding, particularly as only <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/overview" target="_blank">36% </a>of new NSF grant applicants are successful on their first attempt. We became concerned, however, when we were presented with the terms and conditions we would be required to agree to if we accepted the grant. These terms included affirming the statement that we “do not, and will not during the term of this financial assistance award, operate any programs that advance or promote DEI, or discriminatory equity ideology in violation of Federal anti-discrimination laws.” This restriction would apply not only to the security work directly funded by the grant, <b>but to any and all activity of the PSF as a whole</b>. Further, violation of this term gave the NSF the right to “claw back” previously approved and transferred funds. This would create a situation where money we’d already spent could be taken back, which would be an enormous, open-ended financial risk.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div></div><div><br /></div><div>Diversity, equity, and inclusion are core to the PSF’s values, as committed to in our <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/mission/" target="_blank">mission statement</a>:&nbsp;</div><div><div></div></div><blockquote><div><div><i>The mission of the Python Software Foundation is to promote, protect, and advance the Python programming language, and to support and facilitate the growth of <b>a diverse and international community</b> of Python programmers.</i></div></div><div></div></blockquote><div><div>Given the value of the grant to the community and the PSF, we did our utmost to get clarity on the terms and to find a way to move forward in concert with our values. We consulted our NSF contacts and reviewed decisions made by other organizations in similar circumstances, particularly <a href="https://carpentries.org/blog/2025/06/announcing-withdrawal-of-nsf-pose-proposal/" target="_blank">The Carpentries</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div></div><div><br /></div><div><div>In the end, however, the PSF simply can’t agree to a statement that we won’t operate any programs that “advance or promote” diversity, equity, and inclusion, as it would be a betrayal of our mission and our community.&nbsp;</div></div><div><br /></div><div><div>We’re disappointed to have been put in the position where we had to make this decision, because we believe our proposed project would offer invaluable advances to the Python and greater open source community, protecting millions of PyPI users from attempted supply-chain attacks. The proposed project would create new tools for automated proactive review of all packages uploaded to PyPI, rather than the current process of reactive-only review. These novel tools would rely on capability analysis, designed based on a dataset of known malware. Beyond just protecting PyPI users, the outputs of this work could be transferable for all open source software package registries, such as NPM and Crates.io, improving security across multiple open source ecosystems.</div></div><div><br /></div><div><div>In addition to the security benefits, the grant funds would have made a big difference to the PSF’s budget. The PSF is a relatively small organization, operating with an annual budget of around $5 million per year, with a staff of just 14. $1.5 million over two years would have been quite a lot of money for us, and easily the largest grant we’d ever received. Ultimately, however, the value of the work and the size of the grant were not more important than practicing our values and retaining the freedom to support every part of our community. The PSF Board voted unanimously to withdraw our application.&nbsp;</div></div><div><br /></div><div><div>Giving up the NSF grant opportunity—along with inflation, lower sponsorship, economic pressure in the tech sector, and global/local uncertainty and conflict—means the PSF needs financial support now more than ever. We are incredibly grateful for any help you can offer. If you're already a PSF member or regular donor, you have our deep appreciation, and we urge you to share your story about why you support the PSF.

            Building a UI in Python usually means choosing between "quick and limited" or "powerful and painful." What if you could write modern, component-based web apps in pure Python and still keep full control? NiceGUI, pronounced "Nice Guy" sits on FastAPI with a Vue/Quasar front end, gives you real components, live updates over websockets, and it’s running in production at Zauberzeug, a German robotic company. On this episode, I’m talking with NiceGUI’s creators, Rodja Trappe and Falko Schindler, about how it works, where it shines, and what’s coming next. With version 3.0 releasing around the same time this episode comes out, we spend the end of the episode celebrating the 3.0 release.

available. This milestone was achieved largely through a <strong>community effort</strong>,
as several internal refactorings to the C code were required to make it
possible (see <a href="https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil/issues/2565#issuecomment-2910225647">issue #2565</a>).

        <div class="p-4 flex-grow overflow-hidden">
          <p class="text-base-content">
            <p>Plenty has been written about how hard it is to build in Europe versus the US.
The list is always the same with little process: brittle politics, dense
bureaucracy, mandatory notaries, endless and rigid
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_your_customer">KYC</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti%E2%80%93money_laundering">AML</a> processes.
Fine.  I know, you know.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not here to add another complaint to the pile (but if we meet over a beer
or coffee, I&#8217;m happy to unload a lot of hilarious anecdotes on you).  The
unfortunate reality is that most of these constraints won&#8217;t change in my
lifetime and maybe ever.  Europe is not culturally aligned with
entrepreneurship, it&#8217;s opposed to the idea of employee equity, and our laws
reflect that.</p>
<p>What bothers me isn&#8217;t the rules — it&#8217;s the posture that develops from it within
people that should know better.  Across the system, everyone points at someone
else.  If a process takes 10 steps, you&#8217;ll find 10 people who feel absolved of
responsibility because they can cite 9 other blockers.  Friction becomes a
moral license to do a mediocre job (while lamenting about it).</p>
<p>The vibe is: &#8220;Because the system is slow, I can be slow.  Because there are
rules, I don&#8217;t need judgment. Because there&#8217;s risk, I don&#8217;t need initiative.&#8221;
And then we all nod along and nothing moves.</p>
<p>There are excellent people here; I&#8217;ve worked with them.  But they are fighting
upstream against a default of low agency.  When the process is bad, too many
people collapse into it.  Communication narrows to the shortest possible
message.  Friday after 2pm, the notary won&#8217;t reply — and the notary surely will blame
labor costs or regulation for why service ends there.  The bank will cite
compliance for why they don&#8217;t need to do anything.  The registrar will point at
some law that allows them to demand a translation of a document by a court
appointed translator.  Everyone has a reason.  No one owns the outcome.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the US, our counsel replies when it matters, even after hours.
Bankers answer the same day.  The instinct is to enable progress, not enumerate
reasons you can’t have it.  The goal is the outcome and the rules are
constraints to navigate, not a shield to hide behind.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s the point?  I can&#8217;t fix politics.  What I can do: act with agency,
and surround myself with people who do the same and speak in support of it.
Work with those who start from &#8220;how do we make this work?&#8221; not &#8220;why this can&#8217;t
work.&#8221;  Name the absurdities without using them as cover.  Be transparent, move
anyway and tell people.</p>
<p>Nothing stops a notary from designing an onboarding flow that gets an Austrian
company set up in five days — standardized KYC packets, templated resolutions,
scheduled signing slots, clear checklists, async updates, a bias for same-day
feedback.  That could exist right now.  It rarely does or falls short.</p>
<p>Yes, much in Europe is objectively worse for builders.  We have to accept it.
Then squeeze everything you can from what is in your control:</p>
<ul>
<li>Own the handoff. When you&#8217;re step 3 of 10, behave like step 10 depends on you
and behave like you control all 10 steps.  Anticipate blockers further down
the line.  Move same day.  Eliminate ambiguity.  Close loops.</li>
<li>Default to clarity.  Send checklists.  Preempt the next two questions.
Reduce the number of touches.</li>
<li>Model urgency without theatrics.  Be calm, fast, and precise.  Don&#8217;t
make your customer chase you.</li>
<li>Use judgment.  Rules exist and we can&#8217;t break them all.  But we can work with
them and be guided by them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Select for agency.  Choose partners who answer promptly when it&#8217;s material and
who don&#8217;t confuse process with progress.</p>
<p>The trap is not only regulation.  It&#8217;s the learned helplessness it breeds.  If
we let friction set our standards, we become the friction.  We won&#8217;t legislate
our way to a US-style environment anytime soon.  But we don&#8217;t need permission
to be better operators inside a bad one.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the contrast and it&#8217;s the part we control.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Postscript:</strong> Comparing Europe to the US triggers people and I&#8217;m concious of
that.  Maturity is holding two truths at once: they do some things right and
some things wrong and so do we.  You don&#8217;t win by talking others down or
praying for their failure.  I&#8217;d rather see both Europe and the US succeed than
celebrate Europe failing slightly less.</p>
<p>And no, saying I feel gratitude and happiness when I get a midnight reply
doesn&#8217;t make me anti-work-life balance (<a href="/2025/9/4/996/">I am not</a>).  It means
when something is truly time-critical, fast, clear action lifts everyone.  The
times someone sent a document in minutes, late at night, both sides felt good
about it when it mattered.  Responsiveness, used with judgment, is not
exploitation; it&#8217;s respect for outcomes and the relationships we form.</p>

    <h2>String formatting: a <em>very</em> brief history</h2>
    
      
        <p>Python has had many different waves of string interpolation over the years.</p>

      
        <p>It's had percent-style (<code>%</code>) string formatting since pretty much the beginning:</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"Trey"</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">3</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="s2">"</span><span class="si">%s</span><span class="s2">, you have </span><span class="si">%d</span><span class="s2"> new messages."</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">n</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">'Trey, you have 3 new messages.'</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>Then Python 2.4 added a <code>Template</code> class to the <code>string</code> module:</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">string</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">Template</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Template</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"$name, you have $n new messages."</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">substitute</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">n</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">n</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">'Trey, you have 3 new messages.'</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>And Python 2.6 added an even easier version of string formatting with the string <code>format</code> method:</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="s2">"</span><span class="si">{name}</span><span class="s2">, you have </span><span class="si">{n}</span><span class="s2"> new messages."</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">format</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">n</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">n</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">'Trey, you have 3 new messages.'</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>Then Python 3.6 added a new string formatting syntax with <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/string-concatenation-and-string-interpolation/" target="_blank">f-strings</a>:</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="sa">f</span><span class="s2">"</span><span class="si">{</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">, you have </span><span class="si">{</span><span class="n">n</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2"> new messages."</span>
<span class="go">'Trey, you have 3 new messages.'</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>Now, Python 3.14 has yet another string interpolation syntax with t-strings:</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span><span class="s2">"</span><span class="si">{name}</span><span class="s2">, you have </span><span class="si">{n}</span><span class="s2"> new messages."</span>
<span class="go">Template(strings=('', ', you have ', ' new messages.'), interpolations=(Interpolation('Trey'</span>
<span class="go">, 'name', None, ''), Interpolation(3, 'n', None, '')))</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>Well, sort of!</p>

We thank Phyllis Dobbs for managing the RSVP process and the travel grants that enabled many contributors to join us in Cambridge.</p><p>Hosting the CPython Sprint at Arm’s Cambridge offices shows a shared commitment and we send huge thanks to everyone at Arm who made the sprint possible. Arm shares,&nbsp;<br /></p><blockquote><i>“Hosting the latest CPython sprint was more than providing a venue. It was an investment in strengthening one of the most influential open-source communities. Python’s reach is vast, and ensuring its modern components run smoothly on Arm platforms helps the language stay inclusive and performant across architectures. Hosting the sprint gave Arm a way to give back, reinforce bonds with the core team, and invest in Python’s future.”</i></blockquote>The Arm Software Communities team led the effort from start to finish, handling logistics, sponsorship, and every detail that kept things running smoothly. Their support, along with the help of Central Engineering, Facilities, Workplace, People, IT, Developer Marketing, and the Python Guild organizers, ensured a successful and well-organized week for all participants.&nbsp;<p></p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhFP_CiYxoHCWgaZ41foj7-gaL0kS2zB4DdSQiaOdV5Y6I6OuhXr6zte78R8a44TWg_qlSR3HEpnr7-X3dn6DVjhWb9H8BDTpqreGLOmKaqNO3LjQOXxTRn8qVIRnQed0tiI6cu0euG2awp5NJFMe1hBgPMc6nR_9UPq6ne_G2Ebw9MYFc_HQ/s4032/IMG_6754.jpeg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"></a><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhFP_CiYxoHCWgaZ41foj7-gaL0kS2zB4DdSQiaOdV5Y6I6OuhXr6zte78R8a44TWg_qlSR3HEpnr7-X3dn6DVjhWb9H8BDTpqreGLOmKaqNO3LjQOXxTRn8qVIRnQed0tiI6cu0euG2awp5NJFMe1hBgPMc6nR_9UPq6ne_G2Ebw9MYFc_HQ/s4032/IMG_6754.jpeg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"></a><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhKNsOU9QkbfWZ8tAd0WwY6_kBtfwWqMnhuwyvDgn2Zdvc-Fuio4eMEJ2D70QDplsiyp4wEaJT292ypwDvoQhgjAgZdhyphenhyphenOEs1MHcAwX7XCWh-b9vCww8oATXETa5CXSzs8C4k-m3LdlBLdU3_0KImFOaV88ARQPEdjubFEnmcQalwo8s-9cHQ/s5712/IMG_9026.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhFP_CiYxoHCWgaZ41foj7-gaL0kS2zB4DdSQiaOdV5Y6I6OuhXr6zte78R8a44TWg_qlSR3HEpnr7-X3dn6DVjhWb9H8BDTpqreGLOmKaqNO3LjQOXxTRn8qVIRnQed0tiI6cu0euG2awp5NJFMe1hBgPMc6nR_9UPq6ne_G2Ebw9MYFc_HQ/w400-h300/IMG_6754.jpeg" width="400" /><img border="0" height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhKNsOU9QkbfWZ8tAd0WwY6_kBtfwWqMnhuwyvDgn2Zdvc-Fuio4eMEJ2D70QDplsiyp4wEaJT292ypwDvoQhgjAgZdhyphenhyphenOEs1MHcAwX7XCWh-b9vCww8oATXETa5CXSzs8C4k-m3LdlBLdU3_0KImFOaV88ARQPEdjubFEnmcQalwo8s-9cHQ/w300-h400/IMG_9026.jpg" width="300" /></a></div></div>Finally, a huge thank you to all the attendees who traveled from across the world to spend a week in Cambridge. Some came from nearby in the UK and neighboring countries. Many others journeyed across Europe, several crossed the Atlantic, and a few took long-haul and even ultra-long-haul flights of more than 10,000 km. That dedication and commitment to the Python community is what truly made this sprint special.<p></p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh41GONKt-5VAvyO9SoLKDxGB8rnV9QRepkG8vVt9WVI3D5HuMZD8ePqlChqEmXp6phGtW_CSjIdlHX_qIhkiWXRUfUHEXPnzeLsBA-eqfFhbP_em56YGqXg4CZaeMcE8o5-iXpBt5AgUdkhp5dq9Q5M_0D5hf9Aoi5yJb8Owhc4HGA5JvKGQ/s5134/IMG_6666.jpeg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="270" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh41GONKt-5VAvyO9SoLKDxGB8rnV9QRepkG8vVt9WVI3D5HuMZD8ePqlChqEmXp6phGtW_CSjIdlHX_qIhkiWXRUfUHEXPnzeLsBA-eqfFhbP_em56YGqXg4CZaeMcE8o5-iXpBt5AgUdkhp5dq9Q5M_0D5hf9Aoi5yJb8Owhc4HGA5JvKGQ/w400-h270/IMG_6666.jpeg" width="400" /></a></div><p></p><p>Organizing a sprint of this scale takes many hands. From sponsors to volunteers, organizers to attendees, everyone contributed in their own way. This sprint was a reminder that Python is more than a programming language. It is a community that works together, supports one another, and achieves more as a team than any individual could alone.</p><p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Conclusion</h2><p>The sprint was widely regarded as a success. Attendees described it as productive, well-organized, and an excellent community experience. Even so, some aspects could have been improved, and these are valuable lessons to take forward for future events.&nbsp;<br />Sessions such as the Steering Council Q&amp;A, the mentorship discussion led by Tania Allard, and the lightning talks stood out as highlights. They reinforced the value of bringing the community together in person.</p><p>Python is undergoing important technical transitions. Sprints like this accelerate evolution, resolve difficult challenges, and align the community. The concentration of expertise enabled focused, collaborative progress. The ripple effects of this sprint will shape code, discussion, and design decisions for months to come. We look forward to coming together again as a community.<br /><br /></p>

            Python in 2025 is different. Threads really are about to run in parallel, installs finish before your coffee cools, and containers are the default. In this episode, we count down 38 things to learn this year: free-threaded CPython, uv for packaging, Docker and Compose, Kubernetes with Tilt, DuckDB and Arrow, PyScript at the edge, plus MCP for sane AI workflows. Expect practical wins and migration paths. No buzzword bingo, just what pays off in real apps. Join me along with Peter Wang and Calvin Hendrix-Parker for a fun, fast-moving conversation.
