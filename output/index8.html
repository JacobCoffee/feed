            <p>I created Smart Notes to be a digital note taking application that follows
principles from the Zettelkasten method, as explained in Sönke Ahren&rsquo;s book
<em>How to Take Smart Notes</em>.</p>
<p>Two fundamental aspects of the Zettelkasten method are notes and links between
them.</p>
<p>In a physical Zettelkasten, notes are written on index cards (or some similar
format), given unique, hierarchical ids, and stored sequentially in a slip-box:</p>
<p><img alt="Illustration of physical Zettelkasten." height="458" src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/173380/2024/physical-zettelkasten.png" width="600" /></p>
<p>Sönke writes that you should add a new note to the slip-box directly behind the
note you are referring to. That creates one kind of link. He also writes that
you can add it behind multiple notes by by referring to its unique in other
notes.</p>
<p>Here is how I realized this aspect of the Zettelkasten method in Smart Notes:</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of Smart Notes showing how notes and
links are represented." height="337" src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/173380/2024/smart-notes-links.png" width="600" /></p>
<p>Some design decisions and my reasoning about them:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Notes are visualized as a physical index cards. That restricts the amount of
text that you can write on them. I felt like a problem with a digital
approach might be that you write too much on your notes because there is
unlimited space. I was also interested in mimicking the feeling of working
with physical index cards on a table.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Links are visualized as strings between notes. You can link however you want.
In the above example, the note related to both notes are added behind both
the first note and the note that is related to the first note. (The note is
shown twice, but it is the same note.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Note ids are not shown in the UI. In a physical Zettelkasten, note ids are
important to be able to find a note when following a link. (If a note says
&ldquo;see note X&rdquo; you need to be able to locate X in the slip-box.) But in
Smart Notes the link is right there and shows the note that it links to.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="trains-of-thought-and-branches">Trains of thought and branches</h2>
<p>Another aspect of the Zettelkasten method is trains of though. Notes related to
each other can form a train of thought, and reviewing that train of though is
useful. In a physical Zettelkasten related notes are stored close to each
other, and following a train of though can be done by flipping through the
cards in an area.</p>
<p>I was thinking about how this aspect of Zettelkasten could be realized in Smart
Notes.</p>
<p>I read more about how notes are stored and numbered in a physical Zettelkasten.
There seems to be two cases. Either the note is related to an existing note, in
which case it is put right behind it, or the note is not related to any
existing notes, in which case it is put at the end.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if a note is related to an existing note, a distinction seems to
be made if the new note continues the train of though of the previous note or
if it branches off. With the Zettelkasten numbering system, it might be
possible to distinguish these different cases. In <a href="https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/">Introduction to the
Zettelkasten Method</a>, Sascha writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The very first note is assigned the number 1. If you add a second note that
is not related to the first note, it is assigned the number 2. But if you
want to continue the first note, or inject something into its content,
comment on it, or something along those lines, you branch off. That new note
would get assigned the number 1a. If you continue with this new note, you
would go on with 1b. If you then want to comment on the note 1a, you would
create a note with the address 1a1. So, in short, whenever you continue a
train of thought, you increment the last position in the address, be it
number or a character from the alphabet. And when you want to expand,
intersperse, or comment on a note, you take its address and append a new
character.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Smart Note lacks any visible note ids. So I was thinking that I might be
missing out on something. What types of hierarchies are created with the
numbering scheme in Zettelkasten? Can I already replicate those hierarchies in
Smart Notes?</p>
<h2 id="folgezettel">Folgezettel</h2>
<p>There seems to be a debate going on whether the numbering scheme in
Zettelkasten, sometimes called &ldquo;folgezettel&rdquo; is useful or not.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://zettelkasten.de/posts/luhmann-folgezettel-truth/">No, Luhmann was not about
Folgezettel</a>, Sascha
argues that the kind of links created with folgezettel are weak. We know that
there is a relationship between two notes, but we don&rsquo;t know what that
relationship is. Sascha further acknowledges that the folgezettel technique is
probably more practically useful in a physical Zettelkasten, but in a digital
world, creating annotated links is a better solution. (Creating annotated links
is certainly possible in a physical Zettelkasten, but browsing those links
would be tedious because the note in the link might be in a totally different
place in the slip-box.)</p>
<p>In <a href="https://writing.bobdoto.computer/folgezettel-is-more-than-mechanism/">Folgezettel is More than
Mechanism</a>,
Bob argues that the folgezettel technique is useful even in a digital world.
One point is that it allows you to get a bird&rsquo;s eye view of the topics and
threads that are developing in your Zettelkasten. Another point is that it
forces you to think about note relationships when you add notes to the
slip-box.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m starting to think that the mechanism of folgezettel is just about creating
hierarchies of notes. That&rsquo;s certainly possible already in Smart Notes.
Perhaps the numbering scheme is not essential to the Zettelkasten method?
Perhaps I should explore annotated links more instead?</p>
<h2 id="annotated-links">Annotated links</h2>
<p>Sascha&rsquo;s point about annotated links and their importance got me thinking how
to apply it to Smart Notes. (In <a href="https://zettelkasten.de/posts/backlinks-are-bad-links/">Backlinking Is Not Very Useful &ndash; Often Even
Harmful</a>, Sascha talks
more about the importance of adding context to links.)</p>
<p>Here is one thought I had about it early on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An unclear link between two notes can be clarified by inserting a note in
between that explains the reason for the link. <code>A -&gt; B</code> can become <code>A -&gt; explanation -&gt; B</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many years later, I tried this out. It looked like this:</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of Smart Notes showing the use of a
link note." height="345" src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/173380/2024/smart-notes-link-note.png" width="600" /></p>
<p>I found that the &ldquo;explanation note&rdquo; took up much space and made it more
difficult to navigate the note network. That&rsquo;s when I decided that Smart Notes
needed the ability to annotate links instead. Here is how it turned out:</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of Smart Notes showing link
annotations." height="345" src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/173380/2024/smart-notes-link-annotation.png" width="600" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve only experimented with this a little, but I find that navigation is
easier. My hope is that short &ldquo;linking phrases&rdquo; (inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_map">concept
mapping</a>) will be enough to annotate
links.</p>
<h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing thoughts</h2>
<p>With annotated links added, I think Smart Notes is pretty flexible. First of
all you can create arbitrary tree-like structures that can mimic the structure
you get from folgezettel without having to deal with a complicated numbering
scheme. That structure can give you a bird&rsquo;s eye view that Bob talks about. If
you don&rsquo;t want to emphasize a tree structure, you can use annotated links to
link arbitrarily and make the context of the connections clear.</p>
<p>I try to make Smart Notes a digital note taking application that follows
principles from the Zettelkasten method. Sometimes it is easy to focus on the
specifics of the method and try to replicate it as closely as possible. But I
think it is more important to experiment and see what works. Smart Notes has
been my way of exploring Zettelkasten, and I will continue to tweak it as I
learn, both from reading and researching, and from practicing. Most
importantly, I will try to use my notes for creative output and learning and
try to notice what features in Smart Notes maximize that.</p>

            <p>We are looking for the next group of organizers to own and lead the 2026 DjangoCon Europe conference. Could your town - or your football stadium, circus tent, private island or city hall - host this wonderful community event?</p>
<p>DjangoCon Europe is a major pillar of the Django community, as people from across the world meet and share. This includes many qualities that make it a unique event - unconventional and conventional venues, creative happenings, a feast of talks and a dedication to inclusion and diversity.</p>
<p>Hosting a DjangoCon is an ambitious undertaking. It's hard work, but each year it has been successfully run by a team of community volunteers, not all of whom have had previous experience - more important is enthusiasm, organizational skills, the ability to plan and manage budgets, time and people - and plenty of time to invest in the project.</p>
<p>For 2026, we want to kickstart the organization much earlier than in previous years to allow more flexibility for the organizing team, and open up more opportunities for support from our <a href="https://github.com/django/dsf-working-groups/blob/main/active/dceu.md">DjangoCon Europe support working group</a>.</p>
<h2 id="step-1-submit-your-expression-of-interest">Step 1: Submit your expression of interest</h2>
<p>If you’re considering organizing DjangoCon Europe (🙌 great!), fill in our<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf_uFodt6nHghd7uCpQnaCVVT2Rcc2-53c7NTG59iGSFCcxYw/viewform"> DjangoCon Europe 2026 expression of interest form</a> with your contact details. No need to fill in all the information at this stage if you don’t have it all already, we’ll reach out and help you figure it out.</p>

<h2 id="step-2-we-re-here-to-help">Step 2: We’re here to help!</h2>
<p>We've set up a<a href="https://github.com/django/dsf-working-groups/blob/main/active/dceu.md"> DjangoCon Europe support working group</a> of previous organizers that you can reach out to with questions about organizing and running a DjangoCon Europe.</p>
<p>The group will be in touch with everyone submitting the expression of interest form, or you can reach out to them directly: european-organizers-support@djangoproject.com</p>
<p>We'd love to hear from you as soon as possible, so your proposal can be finalized and sent to the DSF board <strong>by October 6th 2024</strong>. The selected hosts will be publicly announced at <a href="https://2025.djangocon.eu/">DjangoCon Europe 2025</a> by the current organizers.</p>
<h2 id="step-3-submitting-the-proposal">Step 3: Submitting the proposal</h2>
<p>The more detailed and complete your final proposal is, the better. Basic details include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Organizing committee members: You won’t have a full team yet, probably, naming just some core team members is enough.</li>
<li>The legal entity that is intended to run the conference: Even if the entity does not exist yet, please share how you are planning to set it up.</li>

<h2 id="q-a">Q&amp;A</h2>
<h3 id="can-i-organize-a-conference-alone">Can I organize a conference alone?</h3>
<p>We strongly recommend that a team of people submit an application.</p>
<h3 id="i-we-don-t-have-a-legal-entity-yet-is-that-a-problem-">I/we don’t have a legal entity yet, is that a problem?</h3>
<p>Depending on your jurisdiction, this is usually not a problem. But please share your plans about the entity you will use or form in your application.</p>
<h3 id="do-i-we-need-experience-with-organizing-conferences">Do I/we need experience with organizing conferences?</h3>
<p>The support group is here to help you succeed. From experience, we know that many core groups of 2-3 people have been able to run a DjangoCon with guidance from previous organizers and help from volunteers.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-required-in-order-to-announce-an-event">What is required in order to announce an event?</h3>
<p>Ultimately, a contract with the venue confirming the dates is crucial, since announcing a conference makes people book calendars, holidays, buy transportation and accommodation etc. This, however, would only be relevant after the DSF board has concluded the application process. Naturally, the application itself cannot contain any guarantees, but it’s good to check concrete dates with your venues to ensure they are actually open and currently available, before suggesting these dates in the application.</p>
<h3 id="do-we-have-to-do-everything-ourselves">Do we have to do everything ourselves?</h3>
<p>No. You will definitely be offered lots of help by the community. Typically, conference organizers will divide responsibilities into different teams, making it possible for more volunteers to join. Local organizers are free to choose which areas they want to invite the community to help out with, and a call will go out through a blog post announcement on djangoproject.com and social media.</p>
<h3 id="what-kind-of-support-can-we-expect-from-the-django-software-foundation-">What kind of support can we expect from the Django Software Foundation?</h3>
<p>The DSF regularly provides grant funding to DjangoCon organizers, to the extent of $6,000 in recent editions. We also offer support via specific working groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>The dedicated<a href="https://github.com/django/dsf-working-groups/blob/main/active/dceu.md"> DjangoCon Europe support working group</a>.</li>
<li>The<a href="https://github.com/django/dsf-working-groups/blob/main/active/social-media.md"> social media working group</a> can help you promote the event.</li>
<li>The<a href="https://github.com/django/dsf-working-groups/blob/main/active/code-of-conduct.md"> Code of Conduct working group</a> works with all event organizers.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, a lot of<a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/individual-members/"> Individual Members</a> of the DSF regularly volunteer at community events. If your team aren’t Individual Members, we can reach out to them on your behalf to find volunteers.</p>
<h3 id="what-dates-are-possible-in-2026">What dates are possible in 2026?</h3>
<p>For 2026, DjangoCon Europe should happen between January 5th and April 27th, or June 4th and June 28th. This is to avoid the following community events’ provisional dates:</p>
<ul>
<li>PyCon US 2026: May 2026</li>
<li>EuroPython 2026: July 2026</li>
<li>DjangoCon US 2026: September - October 2026</li>
<li>DjangoCon Africa 2026: August - September 2026</li>
</ul>
<p>We also want to avoid the following holidays:</p>
<ul>
<li>New Year's Day: Wednesday 1st January 2026</li>
<li>Chinese New Year: Tuesday 17th February 2026</li>
<li>Eid Al-Fitr: Friday 20th March 2026</li>
<li>Passover: Wednesday 1st - Thursday 9th April 2026</li>
<li>Easter: Sunday 5th April 2026</li>
<li>Eid Al-Adha: Tuesday 26th - Friday 29th May 2026</li>
<li>Rosh Hashanah: Friday 11th - Sunday 13th September 2026</li>
<li>Yom Kippur: Sunday 20th - Monday 21st September 2026</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-cities-or-countries-are-possible-">What cities or countries are possible?</h3>
<p>Any city in Europe. This can be a city or country where DjangoCon Europe has happened in the past (Vigo, Edinburgh, Porto, Copenhagen, Heidelberg, Florence, Budapest, Cardiff, Toulon, Warsaw, Zurich, Amsterdam, Berlin), or a new locale.</p>

<h2>PyPy v7.3.17: release of python 2.7 and 3.10</h2>
<p>The PyPy team is proud to release version 7.3.17 of PyPy.</p>
<p>This release includes a new <a class="reference internal" href="https://www.pypy.org/posts/2024/08/pypy-v7317-release.html#risc-v-jit-backend">RISC-V JIT backend</a>, an <a class="reference internal" href="https://www.pypy.org/posts/2024/08/pypy-v7317-release.html#improved-repl">improved REPL</a> based on
work by the CPython team, and <a class="reference internal" href="https://www.pypy.org/posts/2024/08/pypy-v7317-release.html#better-jit-optimizations">better JIT optimizations</a> of integer
operations. Special shout-outs to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/loganchien">Logan Chien</a> for the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pypy/pypy/pull/5002">RISC-V backend
work</a>, to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/nirit100">Nico Rittinghaus</a> for better integer optimization in the JIT, and
the CPython team that has worked on the repl.</p>
<p>The release includes two different interpreters:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>PyPy2.7, which is an interpreter supporting the syntax and the features of
Python 2.7 including the stdlib for CPython 2.7.18+ (the <code class="docutils literal">+</code> is for
backported security updates)</p></li>
<li><p>PyPy3.10, which is an interpreter supporting the syntax and the features of
Python 3.10, including the stdlib for CPython 3.10.14.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The interpreters are based on much the same codebase, thus the dual
release. This is a micro release, all APIs are compatible with the other 7.3
releases. It follows after 7.3.16 release on April 23, 2024.</p>
<p>We recommend updating. You can find links to download the releases here:</p>

</blockquote>
<p>We would like to thank our donors for the continued support of the PyPy
project. If PyPy is not quite good enough for your needs, we are available for
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.pypy.org/pypy-sponsors.html">direct consulting</a> work. If PyPy is helping you out, we would love to hear
about it and encourage submissions to our <a class="reference external" href="https://pypy.org/blog">blog</a> via a pull request
to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pypy/pypy.org">https://github.com/pypy/pypy.org</a></p>
<p>We would also like to thank our contributors and encourage new people to join
the project. PyPy has many layers and we need help with all of them: bug fixes,
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.pypy.org/posts/2024/08/index.html">PyPy</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://rpython.readthedocs.org">RPython</a> documentation improvements, or general <a class="reference external" href="https://www.pypy.org/posts/2024/08/project-ideas.html">help</a> with
making RPython's JIT even better.</p>
<p>If you are a python library maintainer and use C-extensions, please consider
making a <a class="reference external" href="https://hpyproject.org/">HPy</a> / <a class="reference external" href="https://cffi.readthedocs.io">CFFI</a> / <a class="reference external" href="https://cppyy.readthedocs.io">cppyy</a> version of your library that would be performant

<section id="risc-v-backend-for-the-jit">
<span id="risc-v-jit-backend"></span><h3>RISC-V backend for the JIT</h3>
<p>PyPy's JIT has added support for generating 64-bit RISC-V machine code at
runtime (RV64-IMAD, specifically). So far we are not releasing binaries for any
RISC-V platforms, but there are <a class="reference external" href="https://rpython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/riscv.html">instructions</a> on how to cross-compile binaries.</p>
</section>
<section id="repl-improvements">
<span id="improved-repl"></span><h3>REPL Improvements</h3>
<p>The biggest user-visible change of the release is new features in the repl of
PyPy3.10. CPython 3.13 has adopted and extended PyPy's pure-Python repl, adding
a number of features and fixing a number or bugs in the process. We have
backported and added the following features:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Prompts and tracebacks use terminal colors, as well as <a class="reference external" href="https://gist.github.com/egmontkob/eb114294efbcd5adb1944c9f3cb5feda">terminal hyperlinks</a>
for file names.</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bracketed-paste">Bracketed paste</a> enable pasting several lines of input into the terminal
without auto-indentation getting in the way.</p></li>
<li><p>A special interactive help browser (F1), history browser (F2), explicit paste
mode (F3).</p></li>
<li><p>Support for Ctrl-&lt;left/right&gt; to jump over whole words at a time.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>See the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3.13/whatsnew/3.13.html#a-better-interactive-interpreter">CPython documentation for further details</a>. Thanks to Łukasz Langa,
Pablo Galindo Salgado and the other CPython devs involved in this work.</p>

<section id="better-jit-optimizations-of-integer-operations">
<span id="better-jit-optimizations"></span><h3>Better JIT optimizations of integer operations</h3>
<p>The optimizers of PyPy's JIT have become much better at reasoning about and
optimizing integer operations. This is done with a new <a class="reference external" href="https://pypy.org/posts/2024/08/toy-knownbits.html">"knownbits" abstract
domain</a>. In many programs that do bit-manipulation of integers, some of the
bits of the integer variables of the program can be statically known. Here's a
simple example:</p>

<p>With the new abstract domain, the JIT can optimize the <code class="docutils literal">if</code>-condition to
<code class="docutils literal">True</code>, because it already knows that the lowest bit of <code class="docutils literal">x</code> must be set.
This optimization applies to all Python-integers that fit into a machine word
(PyPy optimistically picks between two different representations for <code class="docutils literal">int</code>,
depending on the size of the value). Unfortunately there is very little impact
of this change on almost all Python code, because intensive bit-manipulation is
rare in Python. However, the change leads to significant performance
improvements in <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.pydrofoil.org/en/latest/">Pydrofoil</a> (the RPython-based RISC-V/ARM emulators that are
automatically generated from high-level <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/rems-project/sail/">Sail</a> specifications of the respective
ISAs, and that use the RPython JIT to improve performance).</p>

<section id="pypy-versions-and-speed-pypy-org">
<h3>PyPy versions and speed.pypy.org</h3>
<p>The keen-eyed will have noticed no mention of Python version 3.9 in the
releases above. Typically we will maintain only one version of Python3, but due
to PyPy3.9 support on conda-forge we maintained multiple versions from the
first release of PyPy3.10 in PyPy v7.3.12 (Dec 2022). Conda-forge is
<a class="reference external" href="https://pypy.org/posts/2024/08/conda-forge-proposes-dropping-support-for-pypy.html">sunsetting its PyPy support</a>, which means we can drop PyPy3.9. Since that was
the major driver of benchmarks at <a class="reference external" href="https://speed.pypy.org">https://speed.pypy.org</a>, we revamped the site
to showcase PyPy3.9, PyPy3.10, and various versions of cpython on the home
page. For historical reasons, the "baseline" for comparison is still cpython
3.7.19.</p>
<p>We will keep the buildbots building PyPY3.9 until the end of August, these
builds will still be available on the <a class="reference external" href="https://buildbot.pypy.org/nightly/">nightly builds</a> tab of the buildbot.</p>

<section id="what-is-pypy">
<h3>What is PyPy?</h3>
<p>PyPy is a Python interpreter, a drop-in replacement for CPython
It's fast (<a class="reference external" href="https://speed.pypy.org">PyPy and CPython</a> performance
comparison) due to its integrated tracing JIT compiler.</p>
<p>We also welcome developers of other <a class="reference external" href="https://rpython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html">dynamic languages</a> to see what RPython
can do for them.</p>
<p>We provide binary builds for:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>x86</strong> machines on most common operating systems
(Linux 32/64 bits, Mac OS 64 bits, Windows 64 bits)</p></li>
<li><p>64-bit <strong>ARM</strong> machines running Linux (<code class="docutils literal">aarch64</code>) and macos (<code class="docutils literal">macos_arm64</code>).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>PyPy supports Windows 32-bit, Linux PPC64 big- and little-endian, Linux ARM
32 bit, RISC-V RV64IMAFD Linux, and s390x Linux but does not release binaries.
Please reach out to us if you wish to sponsor binary releases for those
platforms. Downstream packagers provide binary builds for debian, Fedora,
conda, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, Gentoo, and more.</p>

            <p>Greetings, Pythonistas- thank you so much for supporting the work of the Python Software Foundation (PSF) and the Python community! The current PSF Board has decided to invest more in connecting and serving the global Python community by establishing a forum to have regular conversations. The <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/board/" target="_blank">board members of the PSF</a> with the support of <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/records/staff/" target="_blank">PSF staff</a> are excited to introduce monthly PSF Board Office Hours on the <a href="https://discord.gg/4Hm36PPgpG" target="_blank">PSF Discord</a>. The Office Hours will be sessions where you can share with us how we can help your community, express your perspectives, and provide feedback for the PSF.<br /><br /></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">What are the PSF Board Office Hours?</h2><p>Similar to the <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/02/introducing-psf-grants-office-hours.html" target="_blank">PSF Grants Program Office Hours</a> where PSF staff members help to answer questions regarding the <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/grants/" target="_blank">PSF Grants Program</a>, during the PSF Board Office Hours you can participate in a <b>text-based live chat</b> with PSF Board Directors. This is a chance to connect, share, and collaborate with the PSF Board and staff to improve our community together. Occasionally, we will have dedicated topics such as PyCon US and the PSF Board Elections for the office hour sessions. <br /><br />Here is some of the work that we collaborate with staff and volunteers on:<br /></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Promotion and outreach for the Python programming language</li><li>Supporting local Python communities</li><li>Organizing <a href="https://us.pycon.org/" target="_blank">PyCon US</a></li><li>Diversity and Inclusion in our community</li><li>Support handling of Code of Conduct within our communities</li><li>Support regional Python communities via the <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/grants/" target="_blank">PSF Grants Program</a></li><li>Furthering the <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/mission/" target="_blank">mission of the PSF</a></li></ul><p><br />Unless we have a dedicated topic for a session, you are not limited to talking with us about the above topics, although the discussions should be focused on Python, the PSF, and our community. If you think there’s something we can help with or we should know, we welcome you to come and talk to us!<br /><br /></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Joining the office hours</h2><p>The office hour sessions will take place on the PSF Discord server in the #psf-board channel.

            <p>Given that I can't stop creating template engines, I figured I might write
a bit about my learnings of creating <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mitsuhiko/minijinja/">MiniJinja</a> which is an implementation of
my Jinja2 template engine for Rust.  Disclaimer: this post might be a bit
more technical.</p>
<p>There is a good chance you have come across Jinja2 templates before as
they became quite common place in various places over the years.  They
look a bit like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="cp">{%</span> <span class="k">extends</span> <span class="s2">&quot;layout.html&quot;</span> <span class="cp">%}</span><span class="x"></span>
<span class="cp">{%</span> <span class="k">block</span> <span class="nv">body</span> <span class="cp">%}</span><span class="x"></span>
<span class="x">  &lt;p&gt;Hello </span><span class="cp">{{</span> <span class="nv">name</span> <span class="cp">}}</span><span class="x">!&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="cp">{%</span> <span class="k">endblock</span> <span class="cp">%}</span><span class="x"></span>

<div class="section" id="why-minijinja">
<h2>Why MiniJinja?</h2>
<p>Maybe we start with the initial question of why I wrote MiniJinja.  It's
the year 2024 and people don't create a ton of HTML with server side
rendered template engines any more.  While there is some resurgence of
that model thanks to HTMX, hotwire and livewire, I personally use <a class="reference external" href="https://www.solidjs.com/">SolidJS</a> for my internal UI needs.  There is however
always a need to generate some form of text and so somehow Jinja2's need
never really went away.  When I originally created it, it was clearly
meant for generating HTML with some JavaScript sprinkled on top, but in
the years since I have encountered Jinja templates in many more places,
primarily for generating YAML and similar formats.  Lately it comes up for
LLM prompt generation.</p>
<p>My personal need for MiniJinja came out of an experiment I built for
infrastructure automation.  Since the templates had to be loaded
dynamically I could not use a system like Askama.  Askama has type-safe
templates that just generate Rust code.  On the other hand most Jinja
inspired template engines that are dynamic in Rust really do not try very
hard to be Jinja compatible.  Because writing template engines is also fun,
I figured I might give it another try.</p>
<p>Over the last two years I kept adding to the engine until it got to the
point where it's at almost feature parity with Jinja2 and quite enjoyable
to use.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="runtime-values">
<h2>Runtime Values</h2>
<p>When building a template engine for Rust you end up building a little
dynamic programming language that is optimized for text generation.
Consequently you pull in most of the challenges of building a dynamic
language.  Particularly when working in Rust the immediate challenge is
memory management and exposing native Rust objects to the embedded
language.  So the interesting bit here is how to create a system that
allows interactions between the template engine and the Rust world around
it.</p>
<p>MiniJinja, unlike Jinja2 does not use code generation but has a basic
stack based VM and a AST based bytecode compiler.  Since MiniJinja follows
Jinja2 it inherits a lot of the realities of the underlying object system
that Jinja2 inherits from Python.  For instance macros (functions) are
first class objects and they can have closures.  This has challenges
because it's easy to create cycles and Rust has no garbage collector that
can help with this problem.</p>
<p>The core object model in MiniJinja is a <cite>Value</cite> type which is represented
by an enum that looks as follows (some less important variants removed):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="cp">#[derive(Clone)]</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="k">pub</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">struct</span> <span class="nc">Value</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">ValueRepr</span><span class="p">);</span><span class="w"></span>

<span class="cp">#[derive(Clone)]</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="k">pub</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">crate</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">enum</span> <span class="nc">ValueRepr</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="n">Undefined</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nb">None</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="n">Bool</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">bool</span><span class="p">),</span><span class="w"></span>

<span class="w">    </span><span class="n">SmallStr</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">SmallStr</span><span class="p">),</span><span class="w"></span>

<span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>
<p>Externaly everything is a <cite>Value</cite>.  If you <cite>Clone</cite> it, you usually bump a
reference count or you make a cheap memcopy.  Values are either primitives
such as strings, numbers etc. or objects.</p>
<p>For objects MiniJinja provides a tait called <cite>Object</cite> which can be
implemented by most Rust types.  The engine provides a <cite>DynObject</cite> wrapper
is a fancy <cite>Arc&lt;dyn Object&gt;</cite> which supports borrowing and object safety.
<a class="reference external" href="http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2024/5/16/macro-vtable-magic/">I wrote about this before</a>.  What you
will notice is that quite a few of the types involved have an <cite>Arc</cite>.
That's because these values are for the most part reference counted.
Since values here are really fat (they are 24 bytes in memory) a
<cite>SmallStr</cite> type is used to hold up to 22 bytes of string data inline.  One
byte is used to encode the length of the string, and another byte is then
used by the <cite>ValueRepr</cite> to mark which enum variant is in use.  In pure
theory this is all wrong.  We never use weak references, so the weak count
in the <cite>Arc</cite> is not used and clever bit hackery could be used to greatly
reduce the size of the value type.  I think one could get the whole thing
down to 16 bytes trivially or even 8 bytes with NaN tagging.  However I
did not want to walk into the world of unsafe code more than feels
appropriate.</p>
<p>MiniJinjia is also <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mitsuhiko/minijinja/tree/main/benchmarks">plenty fast</a>.</p>
<p>One variant that is worth calling out is <cite>Invalid</cite>.  That's a value that
can exist in the system but it carries an error.  When you're trying to
interact with it in most cases it will propagate this error.  That's used
in the engine in places where the API assumes infallability (particularly
during iteration) but it needs a way to emit an error.  This concept is
quite common when writing an engine in C though typically the actual error
is carried out of bounds.  For instance in QuickJS there is a marker value
that indicates a failure, but the actual error is held on the interpreter
runtime.</p>
<p>The trait definition for objects looks like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">pub</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">trait</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">Object</span>: <span class="nc">Debug</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">+</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">Send</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">+</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">Sync</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>

<p>Some of these methods are implemented automatically.  For instance many of
the methods such as <cite>is_true</cite> or <cite>enumerator_len</cite> have a default
implementation that is based on object <cite>repr</cite> and the return value from
<cite>enumerate</cite>.  But they can be overridden to change the default behavior or
to add some potential optimizations.</p>
<p>One of the most important types in Jinja is a map as it holds the template
context.  They are implemented as you can imagine as <cite>Object</cite>.  The
implementation is in fact pretty trivial:</p>

<p>This reveals two interesting aspects of the object model: First that
<cite>Value</cite> implements <cite>Hash</cite>.  That means any value can be used as the key in
a value.  While this is untypical for Rust and even not what happens in
Python, it simplifies the system greatly.  When in the template engine you
write <cite>{{ object.key }}</cite>, behind the scenes
<cite>object.get_value(Value::from(&quot;key&quot;))</cite> is called.  Since most keys are
typically less than 22 characters, creating a dummy <cite>Value</cite> wrapper around
is not too problematic.</p>
<p>The second and probably more interesting part here is that you can sort of
borrow out of an object for the enumerator.  The <cite>mapped_enumerator</cite>
helper takes a reference to self and invokes a closure which itself can
borrow from self.  This adjacent borrowing is implemented with unsafe code
as there is no other way to make it work.  The combination of <cite>repr</cite>
(defaults to <cite>Map</cite>), <cite>get_value</cite> and <cite>enumerate</cite> gives the object the
behavior, shape and contents.</p>
<p>Vectors look quite similar:</p>

<h2>Enumerators and Object Behaviors</h2>
<p>Enumeration in MiniJinja is a way to allow an object to describe what's
inside of it.  In combination with the return values from <cite>repr()</cite> the
engine changes how iteration is performed.  These are possible
enumerators:</p>

<cite>Enumerator::Empty</cite> does but won't yield any values.  The more interesting
one is <cite>Enumerator::Seq(n)</cite> which basically tells the engine to call
<cite>get_value</cite> from 0 to <cite>n</cite> to yield items from the object.  This is how
sequences are implemented.  The rest are enumerators that just directly
yield values.</p>
<p>So when you want to iterate over a map, you will usually use something
like <cite>Enumerator::Iter</cite> and iterate over all the keys in the map.</p>
<p>The engine then uses <cite>ObjectRepr</cite> to figure out what to do with it.  For
a value marked as <cite>ObjectRepr::Seq</cite> it will display like a sequence, you
can index it with integers, and that it iterates over the values in the
sequence.  If the repr is <cite>ObejctRepr::Map</cite> then the expectation is that
it will be indexable by key and it will iterate over the keys when used in
a loop.  Its default rendering also is a key-value pair list wrapped in
curly braces.</p>
<p>Now quite frankly I don't like that iteration protocol.  I think it's more
sensible for maps to naturally iterate over the key-value pairs, but since
MiniJinja follows Jinja2 and Jinja2 follows Python emulating was
important.</p>
<p>Enumerators are a bit different than iterators because they might only
define how iteration is performed (see: <cite>Enumerator::Seq</cite>).  To actually
create an iterator, the object is then passed to it.  They are also asked
to provide a length.  When an enumerator provides a length it's an
indication to the engine that the object can be iterated over more than
once (you can re-create the enumerator).  This is why objects land in a
MiniJinja template that looks like a list, but is actually just an
iterable object with a known length.  For this MiniJinja uses a trick
where it will inspect the size hint of the iterator to make assumptions
about it.  Internally every enumerator allows the engine to query the
length of it:</p>

<p>The important part here is the call to <cite>size_hint</cite>.  If the upper bound is
known, and the lower bound matches the upper bound then MiniJinja will
assume the iterator will always have that length (for as long as not
iterated).  As a result it will change the way the object is interacted
with.  This for instance means that if you run <cite>range(10)</cite> in a template
it looks like a list when printed even though iteration and number
creation is lazy.  On the other hand if you use the
<cite>Value::make_one_shot_iterator</cite> API the length hint will always be
disabled and MiniJinja will not attempt to interact with the iterator when
printing it:</p>

<div class="section" id="building-a-vm">
<h2>Building a VM</h2>
<p>Lexing and parsing I think is not too puzzling in Rust, but making an AST
and making a VM is kinda unusual.  The first thing is that Rust is just
not particularly amazing at tree structures.  In MiniJinja I really wanted
to avoid having the AST at all, but it does come in in handy to implement
some of the functionality that Jinja2 requires.  For instance to establish
closures it will just walk the AST to figure out which names are looked up
within a function.  I tried a few things to improve how memory allocations
work with the AST.  There are great crates out there for doing this, but
I really wanted MiniJinja to be light on dependencies so I ended up opting
against all of them.</p>
<p>For the AST design I went with large enums that hold <cite>Spanned&lt;T&gt;</cite> values:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">pub</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">enum</span> <span class="nc">Expr</span><span class="o">&lt;'</span><span class="na">a</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="n">Var</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Spanned</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Var</span><span class="o">&lt;'</span><span class="na">a</span><span class="o">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="p">),</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="n">Const</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Spanned</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Const</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">),</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="o">..</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>

<span class="k">pub</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">struct</span> <span class="nc">Var</span><span class="o">&lt;'</span><span class="na">a</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="k">pub</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">id</span>: <span class="kp">&amp;</span><span class="o">'</span><span class="na">a</span> <span class="kt">str</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>

<span class="k">pub</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">struct</span> <span class="nc">Const</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>

<span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>
<p>You might now be curious what <cite>Spanned&lt;T&gt;</cite> is.  It's a wrapper type that
does two things: it boxes the inner node and it stores and adjacent <cite>Span</cite>
which is basically the code location in the original input template for
debugging:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">pub</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">struct</span> <span class="nc">Spanned</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">T</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="n">node</span>: <span class="nb">Box</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">T</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="n">span</span>: <span class="nc">Span</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>
<p>It implements <cite>Deref</cite> like a smart pointer so you can poke right through
it to interact with the node.  The code generator just walks the AST and
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mitsuhiko/minijinja/blob/main/minijinja/src/compiler/codegen.rs">emits instructions</a>
for it.</p>
<p>The instructions themselves are a large enum but the number of arguments
to the variants is kept rather low to not waste too much memory.  The base
size of the instruction is dominated by it being able to hold a <cite>Value</cite>
which as we have established is a pretty hefty thing:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">pub</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">enum</span> <span class="nc">Instruction</span><span class="o">&lt;'</span><span class="na">source</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>

</pre></div>
<p>The VM keeps most of the runtime state on a <cite>State</cite> object that is passed
to a few places.  For instance you have already seen this in the <cite>call</cite>
signature further up.  The state for instance holds the loaded
instructions or the template context.  The VM itself maintains a stack of
values and then just steps through a list of instructions on the state in
a loop.  Since there are a lot of instructions you can <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mitsuhiko/minijinja/blob/b327a8c41ae869bb71452e7b645126ff6966e2ef/minijinja/src/vm/mod.rs#L216">have a look on

<p>Basically the current instruction is held in <cite>pc</cite> (short for program
counter), normally it's advanced by one but jump instructions can change
the <cite>pc</cite> to any other location.  If you run out of instructions the
evaluation ends.</p>
<p>One piece of complexity in the VM comes down to macros.  That's because
lifetimes make that really tricky.  A macro is just a <cite>Value</cite> that holds a
<cite>Macro</cite> <cite>Object</cite> internally.  So how can that macro reference the
instructions, if the instructions themselves have a lifetime to the
template <cite>'source</cite>?  The answer is that they can't (at least I have not
found a reasonable way).  So instead a macro has an ID which acts as a
handle to look up the instructions dynamically from the execution state.
Additionally each state has a unique ID so the engine can assert that
nothing funny was happening.  The downside of this is that a macro cannot
be &quot;returned&quot; from a template.  They can however be imported from one
template into another.</p>
<p>Here is what a macro object looks like in code (abbreviated):</p>

<p>Additionally the closure is a good source of cycles.  For that reason the
engine keeps track of all closures during the execution and breaks cycles
caused by closures manually by clearning them out.</p>

<p>You might have seem something like this in Rust before, but it's still a
bit magical.  How can you make functions with seemingly different
signatures register with the <cite>add_filter</cite> function?  How does the engine
perform the type conversions (as we know the engine has <cite>Value</cite> types, so
where does the <cite>String</cite> conversion take place?).  This is a topic for a
blog post on its own but the answer behind this lies in a a lot of clever
trait hackery.  The <cite>add_filter</cite> function reveals a bit of that hackery:</p>

<p>Hidden behind this rather complex set of traits are some basic ideas:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><cite>FunctionArgs</cite> is a helper trait for type conversions.  It's
implemented for tuples of different sizes made of <cite>ArgType</cite> values.
These tuples represent the signature of the function.  It has a method
called <cite>from_values</cite> which performs that conversion via <cite>ArgType</cite>.</li>
<li><cite>ArgType</cite> which you can't really see in the code above, is a trait that
knows how to convert a <cite>Value</cite> into whatever the function desires as
argument.</li>
<li><cite>Filter</cite> is a trait implemented for function with qualifying

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I think a lot of the patterns in MiniJinja are useful for projects
outside of MiniJinja.  Quite is quite a bit more hidden in it that I have
talked about before such as how <a class="reference external" href="http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2021/11/14/abusing-serde/">MiniJinja is abusing serde</a>.  If you have a need for a Jinja2
compatible template engine I would love if you get some use out of it.  If
you're curious about how to build a runtime and object system in Rust, you
might also find some utility in the codebase.</p>
<p>I myself learned quite a bit about what creative API design can look like
in Rust by building it.  At this point I am incredibly happy with how the
public API of the engine shaped out to be.  The engine is extensively
documented both internally and publicly and you can <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.rs/minijinja/latest/minijinja/">read all about it in
the API docs</a>.</p>

            <p>As I mentioned in a few <a href="https://nedbatchelder.com/blog/archive/year2024.html#month202407" rel="external noopener">recent posts</a>, I&#8217;ve been working
on some significant work in coverage.py to take advantage of new capabilities in
Python.</p><p>Mark Shannon has been <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/122564" rel="external noopener">improving the sys.monitoring
API</a> so that branch coverage can be done with low overhead.  I want to take
advantage of that in coverage.py, but I needed to do some refactoring work
first.  The tests were focused on mapping the complete set of code pathways
(which I called arcs), but using low-overhead branch monitoring won&#8217;t provide
those complete pathways.  If the tests continued to focus on them, they would
fail with sys.monitoring.</p><p>But the complete pathways aren&#8217;t actually needed.  The useful information is
where the branches are, and which branches were taken.  That can be measured
with sys.monitoring.  So a first step was to refactor the tests to focus on
branches instead of arcs.  That took a while, but is now done.</p><p>Not needing all those arcs also meant I could simplify the AST-based parser
that found the arcs, removing about 150 lines.  I suspect there&#8217;s more that
could be removed. Maybe it will happen over time. Also, the new
code.co_branches() method might make it all obsolete over time.</p><p>If you read <a href="https://nedbatchelder.com/blog/202406/coverage_at_a_crossroads.html">Coverage at a crossroads</a> on this blog, I
talked about using ideas from SlipCover like inserting fake lines with an import
hook.  Those exotic ideas were appealing in their way, but are no longer needed,
and they would have brought a bunch of complexity.  With the two new
sys.monitoring events, we can get the branch information directly without
advanced shenanigans.</p><p>There&#8217;s more work to do, including attending to incoming bug reports.  If
you&#8217;d like to help, or learn more about any of this, we have a

<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>Continuing in the series of articles about newest cloud connections in Zato 3.2, this episode covers Atlassian Jira
from the perspective of invoking its APIs to build integrations between Jira and other systems.</p>
<p>There are essentially two use modes of integrations with Jira:</p>
<ol>
<li>Jira reacts to events taking place in your projects and invokes your endpoints accordingly via WebHooks.
   In this case, it is Jira that explicitly establishes connections with and sends requests to your APIs.</li>
<li>Jira projects are queried periodically or as a consequence of events triggered by Jira using means other than WebHooks.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://upcdn.io/kW15bqq/raw/root/static/blog/images/3.2-atlassian/jira-integrations.png" /></p>
<p>The first case is usually more straightforward to conceptualize - you create a WebHook in Jira, point it to your endpoint
and Jira invokes it when a situation of interest arises, e.g. a new ticket is opened or updated. I will talk about this variant
of integrations with Jira in a future instalment as the current one is about the other situation, when it is your systems
that establish connections with Jira.</p>
<p>The reason why it is more practical to first speak about the second form is that, even if WebHooks are somewhat easier
to reason about, they do come with their own ramifications.</p>
<p>To start off, assuming that you use the cloud-based version of
Jira (e.g. https://example.atlassian.net), you need to have a publicly available endpoint for Jira to invoke through WebHooks.
Very often, this is undesirable because the systems that you need to integrate with may be internal ones, never meant
to be exposed to public networks.</p>
<p>Secondly, your endpoints need to have a TLS certificate signed by a public Certificate Authority and they need to be accessible
on port 443. Again, both of these are something that most enterprise systems will not allow at all or it may take months
or years to process such a change internally across the various corporate departments involved.</p>
<p>Lastly, even if a WebHook can be used, it is not always a given that the initial information that you receive in the request
from a WebHook will already contain everything that you need in your particular integration service. Thus, you will still
need a way to issue requests to Jira to look up details of a particular object, such as tickets, in this way reducing
WebHooks to the role of initial triggers of an interaction with Jira, e.g. a WebHook invokes your endpoint,
you have a ticket ID on input and then you invoke Jira back anyway to obtain all the details that you
actually need in your business integration.</p>
<p>The end situation is that, although WebHooks are a useful concept that I will write about in a future article,
they may very well not be sufficient for many integration use cases. That is why I start with integration
methods that are alternative to WebHooks.</p>
<h2 id="alternatives-to-webhooks">Alternatives to WebHooks</h2>
<p>If, in our case, we cannot use WebHooks then what next? Two good approaches are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Scheduled jobs</li>
<li>Reacting to emails (via IMAP)</li>
</ol>
<p>Scheduled jobs will let you periodically inquire with Jira about the changes that you have not processed yet. For instance,
with a job definition as below:</p>
<p><img src="https://upcdn.io/kW15bqq/raw/root/static/blog/images/3.2-atlassian/jira-scheduler-menu.png" /></p>
<p><img src="https://upcdn.io/kW15bqq/raw/root/static/blog/images/3.2-atlassian/jira-scheduler-sample.png" /></p>
<p>Now, the service configured for this job will be invoked once per minute to carry out any integration works required.
For instance, it can get a list of tickets since the last time it ran, process each of them as required in your business context
and update a database with information about what has been just done - the database can be based on Redis, MongoDB, SQL or anything
else.</p>
<p>Integrations built around scheduled jobs make most sense when you need to make periodic sweeps across a large swaths of business
data, these are the "Give me everything that changed in the last period" kind of interactions when you do not know precisely
how much data you are going to receive.</p>
<p>In the specific case of Jira tickets, though, an interesting alternative may be to combine scheduled jobs with IMAP connections:</p>
<p><img src="https://upcdn.io/kW15bqq/raw/root/static/blog/images/3.2-atlassian/jira-imap-menu.png" /></p>
<p><img src="https://upcdn.io/kW15bqq/raw/root/static/blog/images/3.2-atlassian/jira-imap-form.png" /></p>
<p>The idea here is that when new tickets are opened, or when updates are made to existing ones, Jira will send out notifications
to specific email addresses and we can take advantage of it.</p>
<p>For instance, you can tell Jira to CC or BCC an address such as zato@example.com. Now, Zato will still run a scheduled job
but instead of connecting with Jira directly, that job will look up unread emails for it inbox
("UNSEEN" per the relevant
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Message_Access_Protocol">RFC</a>).</p>
<p>Anything that is unread must be new since the last iteration which means that we can process each such email from the inbox, in this way
guaranteeing that we process only the latest updates, dispensing with the need for our own database of tickets already processed.
We can extract the ticket ID or other details from the email, look up its details in Jira and the continue as needed.</p>
<p>All the details of how to work with IMAP emails are provided in the documentation but it would boil down to this:</p>

<p>The natural question is - how would the "process_message" function extract details of a ticket from an email?</p>
<p>There are several ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Each email has a subject of a fixed form - "[JIRA] (ABC-123) Here goes description". In this case, ABC-123 is the ticket ID.</li>
<li>Each email will contain a summary, such as the one below, which can also be parsed:</li>
</ol>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="line-1-1" name="line-1-1"></a><a href="#line-1-1"><span class="linenos"></span></a><span class="w">         </span>Summary:<span class="w"> </span>Here<span class="w"> </span>goes<span class="w"> </span>description

<ol>
<li>Finally, each email will have an "X-Atl-Mail-Meta" header with interesting metadata that can also be parsed and extracted:</li>
</ol>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="line-2-1" name="line-2-1"></a><a href="#line-2-1"><span class="linenos"></span></a>X-Atl-Mail-Meta:<span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">user_id</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;123456:12d80508-dcd0-42a2-a2cd-c07f230030e5&quot;</span>,

</code></pre></div>
<p>The first option is the most straightforward and likely the most convenient one - simply parse out the ticket ID and
call Jira with that ID on input for all the other information about the ticket. How to do it exactly is presented in the
next chapter.</p>
<p>Regardless of how we parse the emails, the important part is that we know that we invoke Jira only when there are new or updated
tickets - otherwise there would not have been any new emails to process. Moreover, because it is our side that invokes Jira,
we do not expose our internal system to the public network directly.</p>
<p>However, from the perspective of the overall security architecture, email is still part of the attack surface so we need to make
sure that we read and parse emails with that in view. In other words, regardless of whether it is Jira invoking us
or our reading emails from Jira, all the usual security precautions regarding API integrations and accepting input from external
resources, all that still holds and needs to be part of the design of the integration workflow.</p>
<h2 id="creating-jira-connections">Creating Jira connections</h2>
<p>The above presented the ways in which we can arrive at the step of when we invoke Jira and now we are ready to actually do it.</p>
<p>As with other types of connections, Jira connections are created in Zato Dashboard, as below. Note that you use the email
address of a user on whose behalf you connect to Jira but the only other credential is that user's API token previously
generated in Jira, not the user's password.</p>

<p><img src="https://upcdn.io/kW15bqq/raw/root/static/blog/images/3.2-atlassian/jira-form.png" /></p>
<p><img src="https://upcdn.io/kW15bqq/raw/root/static/blog/images/3.2-atlassian/jira-change-api-token.png" /></p>
<h2 id="invoking-jira">Invoking Jira</h2>
<p>With a Jira connection in place, we can now create a Python API service. In this case, we accept a ticket ID on input
(called "a key" in Jira) and we return a few details about the ticket to our caller.</p>
<p>This is the kind of a service that could be invoked from a service that is triggered by a scheduled job. That is,
we would separate the tasks, one service would be responsible for opening IMAP inboxes and parsing emails
and the one below would be responsible for communication with Jira.</p>
<p>Thanks to this loose coupling, we make everything much more reusable - that the services can be changed independently is but one part
and the more important side is that, with such separation, both of them can be reused by future services as well,
without tying them rigidly to this one integration alone.</p>

<h2 id="creating-a-rest-channel-and-testing-it">Creating a REST channel and testing it</h2>
<p>The last remaining part is a REST channel to invoke our service through. We will provide the ticket ID (key) on input
and the service will reply with what was found in Jira for that ticket.</p>
<p><img src="https://upcdn.io/kW15bqq/raw/root/static/blog/images/3.2-atlassian/jira-rest-form.png" /></p>
<p>We are now ready for the final step - we invoke the channel, which invokes the service which communicates with Jira,
transforming the response from Jira to the output that we need:</p>

            What are the top downloaded pytest plugins?
I want to know this. And I&rsquo;d like the answer updated regularly.
So today I decided to write a script to do that for me.
Grab data Let&rsquo;s start with Top PyPI Packages from Hugo van Kemenade. This list is &ldquo;A monthly dump of the 8,000 most-downloaded packages from PyPI.&rdquo;
Perfect.
Parse Now:
 Filter for &ldquo;pytest&rdquo; in the package name Remove &ldquo;pytest&rdquo; itself.

            Every year the core developers meet to discuss and propose the major changes and trends in Python itself. This invite-only conference of about 50 people happens inside PyCon in the US. Because it's private, we rarely get detailed looks inside this event. On this episode, we have Seth Michael Larson here to give us his account of the sessions and proposals. It's a unique look into the zeitgeist of CPython.

            <p>Here is a slightly delayed (and short) run-down of the new stuff that we
deployed recently.</p>
<p>The main change for this update is that we have updated the underlying OS
running PythonAnywhere to Ubuntu 22.04. This is an LTS release so it will be
supported for some time to come. This will not affect user environments, but it
is setting us up for a new user environment that should be coming soon.</p>
<p>We have also:</p>
<ul>
<li>Started the process of updating our file servers to be more robust</li>
<li>Improved our alerting so that we are alerted to many new forms of failure on PythonAnywhere</li>
<li>Made some improvements to the ASGI beta systems and their documentation</li>
<li>Fixed a number of security issues</li>
<li>Fixed various bugs</li>

            <p>It has been a few months since I wrote about <a class="reference external" href="https://rye.astral.sh/">Rye</a> here last.  You might remember that in
February I passed over stewardship of my Rye packaging too to <a class="reference external" href="https://astral.sh/">Astral</a>.  The folks over there have been super busy in
building a lot of amazing tooling for Python packaging in the last few
months.  If you have been using Rye in the last few months you will have
noticed that the underlying resolver and installer <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/">uv</a> got a lot better and faster.</p>
<p>As of the most recent release, <cite>uv</cite> also gained a lot of functionality that
previously required Rye such as manipulating <cite>pyproject.toml</cite> files,
workspace support, local package references and script installation.  It
now also can manage Python installations for you so it's getting much
closer.</p>
<p>If you are using Rye today, consider this blog post as a reminder that you
should probably starting having a closer look at <cite>uv</cite> and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/astral-sh/rye/discussions/1342">give feedback to
the Astral folks</a>.</p>
<p>I gave a talk just recently in Prague at EuroPython about my current view
of the Python packaging, the lessons I learned when creating Rye and one
of the things I mentioned there is that the goal of a packaging tool has
to be that it will dominate the space.  The tool that absolutely everybody
uses has to be the best tool: it's the thing any new person to Python gets
to see when they start their programming journey.  After that talk a lot
of people walked up to me and had a lot of questions about that in
particular.</p>
<p>Python in the last two years has become an incredibly hot and popular
platform for many new developers.  That has in part been fueled by all the
investments and interest that went into AI and ML.  I really want
everybody who gets to learn and experience Python not to remember it as an
old language with bad tooling, but as an amazing language with a stellar
developer experience.  Unfortunately that's not the case today because
there is so much choice, so many tools that are not quite compatible, and
by the inconsistency everywhere.  I have seen people walk down one tool,
just to re-emerge moving their entire stack to conda and back because they
hit some wall.</p>
<p>Domination is a goal because it means that most investment will go into
one stack.  I can only re-iterate my wish and desire that Rye (and with it
a lot of other tools in the space) should cease to exist once the
dominating tool has been established.  For me <cite>uv</cite> is poised to be that
tool.  It's not quite there today yet for all cases, but it will be in no
time, and now is the moment to step up as a community and start to start
to rally around it.  That doesn't mean that this tool will be the tool
forever.  Things come and go and maybe there is a future for some other
tool.</p>
<p>But today I'm looking forward to the moment when there will be a final
release of Rye that is no remaining functionality other than to just
largely alias to uv, that retires Rye specific functionality and migrates
you over to uv.</p>
<p>However I <em>only have the power to retire one tool, and that won't be
enough</em>.  Today we are using so many other package managing solutions for
Python and we should be advertising fewer.  I understand how much time and
effort went into many of those, and everybody's contributions are
absolutely appreciated.  Software like Rye and uv were built on the
advancements of the ecosystem underneath it.  They leverage years and
years of work that went into migrating the Python ecosystems from setup.py
files to eggs and finally wheels.  From not having a metadata standard to
having one.  From coupled to decoupled build systems.  Much of what makes
Rye so enjoyable were individuals that worked towards making
redistributable and downloadable Python binaries a possibility.  There was
a lot of work that was put into building out an amazing ecosystem of Rust
crates and Python libraries needed to make these tools work.  All of that
brought us to that point where we are today.</p>
<p>But it is my believe that we need to take the next step and be willing to
say as a community that some tools are no longer recommended.  Maybe not
today, but that moment will come quicker than we think.  I remember a time
when many of us who maintained Python libraries pointed new developers to
using <cite>ez_setup.py</cite> and <cite>easy_install</cite> in our onboarding guides.  Years
later we removed the mentions of <cite>ez_setup.py</cite> from our guides to replace
them with <cite>pip</cite>.  Some of us have pointed developers at <cite>pip-tools</cite>, at
<cite>poetry</cite> or <cite>PDM</cite>.  Many projects today even show 5 different installation
guides because of that wild variety of tools available because they no
longer feel like they can recommend one.</p>
<p>If you maintain an important Python project I would ask you to give <cite>uv</cite> a
try and ask yourself if you would consider pointing people towards it.  I
think that this is our best shot in the community at finding ourselves in
a much better position than we have ever been.</p>
<p>Have a look at the blog post that Charlie from Astral wrote about what <a class="reference external" href="https://astral.sh/blog/uv-unified-python-packaging">uv
can do today</a>.
It's a true accomplishment worth celebrating and enjoying.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<small><p><strong>Postscriptum:</strong> there is an elephant in the room which is that Astral is a
VC funded company.  What does that mean for the future of these tools?
Here is my take on this: for the community having someone pour money into
it can create some challenges.  For the PSF and the core Python project
this is something that should be considered.  However having seen the code
and what uv is doing, even in the worst possible future this is a very
forkable and maintainable thing.  I believe that even in case Astral shuts
down or were to do something incredibly dodgy licensing wise, the
community would be better off than before uv existed.</p>

            <p>Ever wished you could take an <strong>Intro to Python training</strong> with me, but you don&rsquo;t work for a company with a generous training budget?
I&rsquo;m running a Python-learning program just for this situation.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/high-five/">Python High Five</a> is a 10-week Python jumpstart program that starts <strong>this September</strong>.</p>

<h2>Set aside the time to learn ⌚</h2>

<p>One of the biggest problems for folks starting to learn Python is <strong>setting aside the time</strong>.
And even if you <em>do</em> manage to set aside the time, you&rsquo;ll often hit a roadblock where you feel <strong>confused</strong>.</p>

<p>Python High Five is a way to keep a <strong>daily learning habit</strong> <em>and</em> to <strong>get help</strong> when find yourself stuck.</p>

<p>This program is based around <strong>daily practice</strong>.
Monday through Friday you&rsquo;ll pick <strong>30 minutes</strong> from your schedule, at any time that works you.
During those 30 minutes, you&rsquo;ll watch a 5 minute video, work on the day&rsquo;s exercise, and reflect on your progress.</p>

<h2>The most effective learning is hands-on 🖐️</h2>

<p>Python High Five is all about learning through <strong>writing Python code</strong>.
Each week we&rsquo;ll dive deeper into Python, building upon what we&rsquo;ve learned so far.</p>

<p>When you find yourself stuck you can get help through an asynchronous <strong>group chat</strong> and weekly <strong>office hour</strong> sessions.
In addition to our weekly office hours together, I&rsquo;ll check the chat each day, respond to questions, and provide guidance.</p>

<h2>Proven learning techniques behind the scenes 📝</h2>

<p>The daily check-ins allow for daily <strong>accountability</strong>.
The group chat also provides both a community of peers to rely on, and <strong>guidance from an experienced Python trainer</strong> (me).</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll also be using proven learning techniques behind the scenes:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Retrieval practice</strong>: you don&rsquo;t learn by putting information into your head, but by trying to take it out; for Python learning, that means writing code.</li>
<li><strong>Spaced repetition</strong>: cramming is less effective than learning spaced out over time, which is why we&rsquo;ll spend 30 minutes each weekday instead of spending a few hours every week.</li>
<li><strong>Interleaving</strong>: each day&rsquo;s exercise isn&rsquo;t predictably themed because a bit of unpredictability can be <em>really</em> improve learning outcomes.</li>
<li><strong>Elaboration</strong>: your daily check-in isn&rsquo;t <em>just</em> about reflection: it&rsquo;s also a helpful learning tool!</li>
</ul>


<p>Plus, we&rsquo;ll be working through curriculum I&rsquo;ve been developing and iterating on for many years.
I have taught these topics in many different settings to folks from <em>many</em> different backgrounds.</p>

<h2>Form a daily learning habit 🔁</h2>

<p>Any 10-week program will be <em>just the start</em> of a Python learning habit.
You&rsquo;ll need to keep up your Python after Python High Five ends, either by promptly applying your skills to a new project or diving deeper into Python with continued daily practice.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m offering an <strong>80% discount</strong> for High Five attendees on one year of <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com">Python Morsels</a>, which is my skill-building service designed to help <strong>deepen your Python skills every week</strong>.
