</div>

<p>Enabling rate-limiting in Zato means that access to Zato APIs can be throttled per endpoint, user or service - including options to make limits apply to specific IP addresses only - and if limits are exceeded within a selected period of time, the invocation will fail. Let's check how to use it all.</p>
<p><img src="https://upcdn.io/kW15bqq/raw/root/static/blog/images/api-rate-limit-intro/arch.png" /></p>
<p>API rate limiting works on several levels and the configuration is always checked in the order below, which follows from the narrowest, most specific parts of the system (endpoints), through users which may apply to multiple endpoints, up to services which in turn may be used by both multiple endpoints and users.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, per-endpoint limits</li>
<li>Then, per-user limits</li>
<li>Finally, per-service limits</li>
</ul>
<p>When a request arrives through an endpoint, that endpoint's rate limiting configuration is checked. If the limit is already reached for the IP address or network of the calling application, the request is rejected.</p>
<p>Next, if there is any user associated with the endpoint, that account's rate limits are checked in the same manner and, similarly, if they are reached, the request is rejected.</p>
<p>Finally, if the endpoint's underlying service is configured to do so, it also checks if its invocation limits are not exceeded, rejecting the message accordingly if they are.</p>
<p>Note that the three levels are distinct yet they overlap in what they allow one to achieve.</p>
<p>For instance, it is possible to have the same user credentials be used in multiple endpoints and express ideas such as "Allow this and that user to invoke my APIs 1,000 requests/day but limit each endpoint to at most 5 requests/minute no matter which user".</p>
<p>Moreover, because limits can be set on services, it is possible to make it even more flexible, e.g. "Let this service be invoked at most 10,000 requests/hour, no matter which user it is, with particular users being able to invoke at most 500 requests/minute, no matter which service, topping it off with per separate limits for REST vs. SOAP vs. JSON-RPC endpoint, depending on what application is invoke the endpoints". That lets one conveniently express advanced scenarios that often occur in practical situations.</p>
<p>Also, observe that API rate limiting applies to REST, SOAP and JSON-RPC endpoints only, it is not used with other API endpoints, such as AMQP, IBM MQ, SAP, task scheduler or any other technologies. However, per-service limits work no matter which endpoint the service is invoked with and they will work with endpoints such as WebSockets, ZeroMQ or any other.</p>
<p>Lastly, limits pertain to with incoming requests only - any outgoing ones, from Zato to external resources - are not covered by it.</p>
<h2 id="per-ip-restrictions">Per-IP restrictions</h2>
<p>The architecture is made even more versatile thanks to the fact that for each object - endpoint, user or service - different limits can be configured depending on the caller's IP address.</p>
<p>This adds yet another dimension and allows to express ideas commonly witnessed in API-based projects, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>External applications, depending on their IP addresses, can have their own limits</li>
<li>Internal users, e.g. employees of the company using VPN, may have hire limits if their addresses are in the 172.x.x.x range</li>
<li>For performance testing purposes, access to Zato from a few selected hosts may have no limits at all</li>
</ul>
<p>IP-based limits work hand in hand are an integral part of the mechanism - they do not rule out per-endpoit, user or service limits. In fact, for each such object, multiple IP-using limits can be set independently, thus allowing for highest degree of flexibility.</p>
<h2 id="exact-or-approximate">Exact or approximate</h2>
<p>Rate limits come in two types:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exact</li>
<li>Approximate</li>
</ul>
<p>Exact rate limits are just that, exact - they en that a limit is not exceeded at all, not even by a single request.</p>
<p>Approximate limits may let a very small number of requests to exceed the limit with the benefit being that approximate limits are faster to check than exact ones.</p>
<p>When to use which type depends on a particular project:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In some projects, it does not really matter if callers have a limit of 1,000 requests/minute or 1,005 requests/minute because the difference is too tiny to make a business impact. Approximate limits work best in this case.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In other projects, there may be requirements that the limit never be exceeded no matter the circumstances. Use exact limits here.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="python-code-and-web-admin">Python code and web-admin</h2>
<p>Alright, let's check how to define the limits in the Zato Dashboard. We will use the sample service below:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="line-0-1" name="line-0-1"></a><a href="#line-0-1"><span class="linenos"></span></a><span class="c1"># -*- coding: utf-8 -*-</span>

<a id="line-0-3" name="line-0-3"></a><a href="#line-0-3"><span class="linenos"></span></a><span class="c1"># Zato</span>

<a id="line-0-7" name="line-0-7"></a><a href="#line-0-7"><span class="linenos"></span></a>    <span class="n">name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">'api.sample'</span>
<a id="line-0-8" name="line-0-8"></a><a href="#line-0-8"><span class="linenos"></span></a>
<a id="line-0-9" name="line-0-9"></a><a href="#line-0-9"><span class="linenos"></span></a>    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">handle</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
<a id="line-0-10" name="line-0-10"></a><a href="#line-0-10"><span class="linenos"></span></a>
<a id="line-0-11" name="line-0-11"></a><a href="#line-0-11"><span class="linenos"></span></a>        <span class="c1"># Return a simple string on response</span>
<a id="line-0-12" name="line-0-12"></a><a href="#line-0-12"><span class="linenos"></span></a>        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">response</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">payload</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">'Hello there!</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s1">'</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now, in web-admin, we will configure limits - separately for the service, a new and a new REST API channel (endpoint).</p>
<p><img src="https://upcdn.io/kW15bqq/raw/root/static/blog/images/api-rate-limit-intro/service.png" /></p>
<p><img src="https://upcdn.io/kW15bqq/raw/root/static/blog/images/api-rate-limit-intro/user.png" /></p>
<p><img src="https://upcdn.io/kW15bqq/raw/root/static/blog/images/api-rate-limit-intro/channel.png" /></p>
<p>Points of interest:</p>
<ul>
<li>Configuration for each type of object is independent - within the same invocation some limits may be exact, some may be approximate</li>
<li>There can be multiple configuration entries for each object</li>
<li>A unit of time is "m", "h" or "d", depending on whether the limit is per minute, hour or day, respectively</li>
<li>All limits within the same configuration are checked in the order of their definition which is why the most generic ones should be listed first</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="testing-it-out">Testing it out</h2>
<p>Now, all is left is to invoke the service from curl.</p>
<p>As long as limits are not reached, a business response is returned:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="line-1-1" name="line-1-1"></a><a href="#line-1-1"><span class="linenos"></span></a>$ curl http://my.user:password@localhost:11223/api/sample

<p>Note that the caller never knows what the limit was - that information is saved in Zato server logs along with other details so that API authors can correlate what callers get with the very rate limiting definition that prevented them from accessing the service.</p>

<p>In the last month we focused on speeding-up performance issues, fixing bugs and improving the behaviour of things - building on the changes from <a href="https://discuss.tryton.org/t/tryton-release-7-2/">our last release</a>. We also added some new features which we would like to introduce to you in this newsletter.</p>
<p>For an in depth overview of the <a href="https://bugs.tryton.org/">Tryton issues please take a look at our issue tracker </a> or see the issues and merge requests <a href="https://foss.heptapod.net/tryton/tryton/-/labels">filtered by label</a>.</p>
<h2 id="heading--user">Changes for the User</h2>
<h3 id="heading--sales-purchase">Sales, Purchases and Projects</h3>
<p>We use a <a href="https://code.tryton.org/tryton/commit/236fd7b8d47ff5996b9ea45f3ae407438eeb687a">dedicated <em>Web Shop</em>-page</a> on the product form which contains web shop related fields.</p>
<p>We’ve <a href="https://code.tryton.org/tryton/commit/6d471f3417b941c52aca71f5876d9064b3272b8d">added relates from sale and purchase lines to their stock moves and invoice lines</a>.</p>
<p>Purchase and sale amendments now allow you to <a href="https://bugs.tryton.org/13256">update the secondary unit</a> of its lines.</p>
<p>Now Tryton <a href="https://code.tryton.org/tryton/commit/2058a8dcc1cef87aca7bcc21cd2ae563df9aeefb">deletes a purchase request</a> when its related product is deleted. Previously such a purchase request was kept in the system, but we decided that it’s better to just remove it.</p>
<h3 id="heading--accounting">Accounting, Invoicing and Payments</h3>
<p><a href="https://bugs.tryton.org/13351">Payments with zero amount</a> are allowed again. This allows the system to correctly handle full refunds for some payment gateways that use zero amounts on them.</p>
<h3 id="heading--stock">Stock, Production and Shipments</h3>
<p>When counting inventories with lots <a href="https://bugs.tryton.org/13083">we now also show the lot in addition to the product</a>, as a product may have many lots.</p>
<h3 id="heading--ui">User Interface</h3>
<p>Sao now uses a <a href="https://bugs.tryton.org/13120">grid to display <code>trytond.model.fields.Dict</code> items</a> to add more flexibility.</p>
<p>To make Tryton more accessible we now <a href="https://bugs.tryton.org/7560">make the contents of the message-dialog selectable</a> and copiable.</p>
<h3 id="heading--system-data-config">Data and Configuration</h3>
<p>We improved the user experience when importing CSV data. This eases the adoption of Tryton by lowering the barrier to load initial data in to the system. Here is a list of the relevant changes:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://code.tryton.org/tryton/commit/ee661619f233b50e6d2c7da256be3df89e1a4580">The import wizard no longer closes the import window on errors</a>.</li>
<li>Error messages <a href="https://code.tryton.org/tryton/commit/12202a0457eff16d1a75d58a096d4388c19208f1">include row and column numbers</a> to ease manual error correction.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://code.tryton.org/tryton/commit/18244ea6bdd09b9a35410d473af3b1006552b3b3">raise a user error when the import data has a different number of columns</a> to that defined in the import wizard.</li>
</ul>
<p>The CSV export also got new features. It now <a href="https://bugs.tryton.org/13266">supports different languages per column in one export</a>. This is specially useful when working with translatable master data like, for example, product names.</p>
<p>We’ve now replaced the <a href="https://code.tryton.org/tryton/commit/d9bd11cd8b5a6796f6a08b55b16c2aa73297a37d">“Accounting Party” user access group with the “Accounting” user access group</a>. This was done because there is no need to limit accounting fields from party to a specific group by default.</p>
<h2 id="heading--new-documentation">New Documentation</h2>
<p><a href="https://docs.tryton.org/latest/modules-ldap-authentication/index.html">The <code>ldap_authentication</code> module is now documented</a>.</p>
<p>Did you know, that a <a href="https://docs.tryton.org/latest/server/ref/models.html#trytond.model.Model._rec_name"><code>Model._rec_name</code> <strong>must</strong> point to a <code>trytond.model.fields.Char</code></a> field?</p>
<h2 id="heading--new-releases">New Releases</h2>
<p>We released bug fixes for the currently maintained <a href="https://discuss.tryton.org/t/release-process/395">long term support series</a><br />
<a href="https://foss.heptapod.net/tryton/tryton/-/commits/branch/7.0">7.0</a> and <a href="https://foss.heptapod.net/tryton/tryton/-/commits/branch/6.0">6.0</a>, and for the latest release series <a href="https://foss.heptapod.net/tryton/tryton/-/commits/branch/7.2">7.2</a>.</p>
<h2 id="heading--sysadmin">Changes for the System Administrator</h2>
<p>We’ve added a new <a href="https://code.tryton.org/tryton/commit/9b383935960c7a95067f65910f0e1077f1cd6d51">configuration section <code>[report]</code> with option <code>convert_command</code></a> to be able to use a different document converter.</p>
<p>Now the <code>trytond-admin</code> command validates the email-value. The <a href="https://bugs.tryton.org/13294">interactive email input loops until a valid email address is entered</a>.</p>
<h2 id="heading--developer">Changes for Implementers and Developers</h2>
<p>We added the option <code>--export-translations</code> to the <code>trytond-admin</code> command. It <a href="https://bugs.tryton.org/13231">exports the translation of any activated module</a> to their respective <code>locale</code> folder.</p>

<p>Back in September 2023 the <a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-4863">libwebp vulnerability</a> (also known as BLASTPASS)
was being actively exploited to target a journalist's mobile device.
After reading the <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2023/09/blastpass-nso-group-iphone-zero-click-zero-day-exploit-captured-in-the-wild">report from Citizen Lab</a>
I learned about an iOS feature called "<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-ca/105120">Lockdown Mode</a>" for Apple devices.</p>

<p>I've been running Lockdown Mode <a href="https://twitter.com/sethmlarson/status/1700186723638997344">for almost a year now</a>, and at the time I promised a write-up of my experience with the feature,
so here it is!</p>

<h2>How does Lockdown Mode keep your phone more secure?</h2>

<p>Lockdown Mode prevents some methods of sending or injecting data into your phone
without your active engagement (such as preloading data, injecting data into unsecured connections, etc).
Data that's processed by your phone automatically, such as images, can exploit flaws in image format parser
in order to escape and begin executing code.</p>

<p>BLASTPASS exploited memory safety issues in the libwebp library
which processes WebP images. The malicious WebP image was delivered to the target's device via a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/walletpasses/building_a_pass">PassKit attachment</a>
which can be sent in a text message.</p>

<h2>What does Lockdown Mode disable?</h2>

<p>Here's the full list of disabled or degraded features when Lockdown Mode is enabled, quoted from <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-ca/105120">Apple's docs</a> on the feature:</p>

<ul>
<li>Most message attachment types are blocked. Some features such as links and link previews are unavailable.</li>
<li>Certain complex web technologies are blocked. (ie JavaScript JIT)</li>
<li>FaceTime calls from unknown contacts are blocked. SharePlay and Live Photos are unavailable.</li>
<li>Photo location information is excluded. Shared Albums are removed and disabled.</li>
<li>Wi-Fi must be secure for device to connect to a network. 2G cellular support is disabled.</li>
<li>Mobile Device Management and Configuration Profiles are disabled.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What are the impacts?</h2>

<p>The biggest impacts for day-to-day usage is two-fold: Message Links and Search.</p>

<p>With Lockdown Mode enabled, links will not highlight like they typically do,
and they won't show the fancy preloaded image that gives you a preview of the content on the other side of a click.</p>

<p>Not having links and link previews in messages is a real inconvenience. The fastest work-around to extract a link
in the middle of a text message is to either copy the whole message into your own message box and then
copy the URL or to screenshot the message and use <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/120004">Live Text</a> to copy-and-paste directly from your screenshot.</p>

<p>If you're able to persuade your partner to send links in a separate message, that also speeds up the copy-and-paste process by copying the whole message.
Persuading your partner is left as an exercise to the reader :)</p>

<p>The other major impact is not being able to search through my messages.
This feature is super helpful when you're trying to recall something from years ago, but not something you're using every day usually.
This feature being disabled has never been such a problem that I've had a memorable negative outcome, but it definitely is frustrating when you know the answer is <em>somewhere</em> in your messages.</p>

<p>The only other time Lockdown Mode has introduced friction is during Trina and I's wedding.
The wedding party was sharing pictures and videos via a Shared Album which aren't available
when Lockdown Mode is enabled. Fortunately, I could disable Lockdown Mode for a short time after the wedding
was over, copy all the photos that I wanted, and then re-enable Lockdown Mode to work-around this.</p>

<p>Beyond this, some image formats don't load in any context (likely WebP?) and I haven't noticed any slowdown from not having a JavaScript JIT. </p>

<h2>Would I recommend Lockdown Mode?</h2>

<p>For most people: no. If you have a decent reason to expect you'd be the target of a cyberattack, then you should definitely consider it.</p>

<p>There is a non-zero amount of extra friction to using your phone, but as someone who's trying to actively
reduce my phone usage anyway it wasn't a big issue over the year that I've had it enabled.</p>

<h2>Bonus tip: Quick one-time disabling of biometric authentication</h2>

<p>Privacy gated by biometrics (ie, "Face ID" or fingerprint scanners) <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/04/cops-can-force-suspect-to-unlock-phone-with-thumbprint-us-court-rules/">doesn't have the same legal protections as a password</a>.
Biometrics are quite convenient, especially if you've configured a relatively short amount of time that your phone
will lock itself after a lack of use.</p>

<p>So how can one have the benefits of biometrics while maintaining the ability to disable biometrics if needed?</p>

<p>By holding down the volume up and side button on your iPhone you'll bring up the screen
that offers to shut down your phone or enter "SOS mode". If you select cancel on this screen your phone
will become locked again but will <strong>require non-biometric authentication for the next phone unlock</strong>.</p>

<p>Give it a try on your phone, so you understand what to do ahead of time.</p>

<p>Because this process is fast (takes less than a second of holding the two buttons) it's great to have in
your back pocket in case you need it. It's also useful for one-time activities when you're separated from your
device such as crossing a security checkpoint.</p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p><strong>eGenix PyRun</strong><a class="egenix-tm" href="/company/legal/trademarks.html">™</a>
 is our open source, one file, no installation version of Python, making
 the distribution of a Python interpreter to run Python based scripts 
and applications to Unix based systems simple and efficient.</p>


<p>eGenix PyRun's executable <b>only needs 4-6MB </b><b>on disk</b>, but still supports most Python applications and scripts.
</p>

<p>Compared to a regular Python installation of typically 100MB on disk,
 eGenix PyRun is ideal for applications and scripts that need to be 
distributed to containers, VMs, clusters, client installations, customers or end-users.</p>


<p style="font-weight: bold;">It makes "installing" Python on a Unix based system as simple as copying a single file.</p>

<p>eGenix has been using eGenix PyRun as run-time for the Linux version of <a href="/products/python/mxODBCConnect/">mxODBC Connect Server</a> 
product since 2008 with great success and decided to make it available as a 
stand-alone open-source product.
</p>



We provide the source archive to build your own <a href="https://github.com/eGenix/egenix-pyrun"><b>eGenix PyRun on Github</b></a>,
 as well as a few binary distributions to get you started on Linux 
x86_64. In the future, we will set up automated builds for several other
 platforms.<p>Please see the product page for more details:

            <p>I am pleased to announce the release of <a href="https://scikit-survival.readthedocs.io/" target="_blank">scikit-survival</a> 0.23.0.</p>
<p>This release adds support for scikit-learn 1.4 and 1.5, which includes missing value support for <a href="https://scikit-survival.readthedocs.io/en/v0.23.0/api/generated/sksurv.ensemble.RandomSurvivalForest.html#sksurv.ensemble.RandomSurvivalForest" target="_blank">RandomSurvivalForest</a>.
For more details on missing values support, see the section
in the <a href="https://k-d-w.org/blog/2023/10/scikit-survival-0.22.0-released/#missing-values-support-in-survivaltree" target="_blank">release announcement for 0.23.0</a>.</p>
<p>Moreover, this release fixes critical bugs. When fitting <a href="https://scikit-survival.readthedocs.io/en/v0.23.0/api/generated/sksurv.tree.SurvivalTree.html#sksurv.tree.SurvivalTree" target="_blank">SurvivalTree</a>, the <code>sample_weight</code> is now correctly considered when computing the log-rank statistic for each split. This change also affects <a href="https://scikit-survival.readthedocs.io/en/v0.23.0/api/generated/sksurv.ensemble.RandomSurvivalForest.html#sksurv.ensemble.RandomSurvivalForest" target="_blank">RandomSurvivalForest</a> and <a href="https://scikit-survival.readthedocs.io/en/v0.23.0/api/generated/sksurv.ensemble.ExtraSurvivalTrees.html#sksurv.ensemble.ExtraSurvivalTrees" target="_blank">ExtraSurvivalTrees</a> which pass <code>sample_weight</code> to the individual trees in the ensemble. Therefore, the outputs produced by <em>SurvivalTree</em>,
<em>RandomSurvivalForest</em>, and <em>ExtraSurvivalTrees</em> will differ from previous releases.</p>
<p>This release fixes a bug in <a href="https://scikit-survival.readthedocs.io/en/v0.23.0/api/generated/sksurv.ensemble.ComponentwiseGradientBoostingSurvivalAnalysis.html#sksurv.ensemble.ComponentwiseGradientBoostingSurvivalAnalysis" target="_blank">ComponentwiseGradientBoostingSurvivalAnalysis</a> and <a href="https://scikit-survival.readthedocs.io/en/v0.23.0/api/generated/sksurv.ensemble.GradientBoostingSurvivalAnalysis.html#sksurv.ensemble.GradientBoostingSurvivalAnalysis" target="_blank">GradientBoostingSurvivalAnalysis</a> when dropout is used. Previously, dropout was only applied starting with the third iteration, now dropout is applied in the second iteration too.</p>
<p>Finally, this release adds compatibility with numpy 2.0 and drops support for Python 3.8.</p>
<h2 id="install">Install</h2>
