            <p>The PSF Community Service Awards (CSA’s) are a formal way for the PSF Board of Directors to offer recognition of work which, in its opinion, significantly improves the Foundation's fulfillment of its mission and benefits the broader Python community. These awards shine a light on the incredible people who are the heart and soul of our community– those whose dedication, creativity, and generosity help the PSF fulfill its mission. The PSF CSAs celebrate individuals who have been truly invaluable, inspiring others through their example, and demonstrates that service to the Python community leads to recognition and reward. If you know of someone in the Python community deserving of a PSF CSA award, please submit them to the PSF Board via psf@python.org at any time. You can read more about <a href="https://www.python.org/community/awards/psf-awards/" target="_blank">PSF CSAs on our website</a>.&nbsp;<br /><br />The PSF Board is excited to announce three new CSAs, awarded to Katie McLaughlin, Sarah Kuchinsky, and Rodrigo Girão Serrão, for their contributions to the Python community. Read more about their contributions and impact below.&nbsp;</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Katie McLaughlin</h2><p>Katie has been a tireless and dedicated member of the Python and Django communities for many years. They have served on the boards of both the DSF and PSF, including as PSF Communications Officer, and was named a PSF Fellow in 2018. Katie has played a big role in the Australian conference community– chairing DjangoCon AU 2017, PyCon AU in 2018 and 2019, and co-chairing PyCon AU 2021– and continues to support PyCon AU as an advisor.</p><p>A frequent speaker and keynote presenter at PyCons and DjangoCons around the world, Katie has worked to demystify Python website deployment, highlight the value of all kinds of open source contributions, and call out the impact of contempt culture on developer communities. They are also a regular at sprints, helping new contributors get started and improving onboarding through code and documentation.&nbsp;</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Sarah Kuchinsky</h2><p>Sarah has been the driving force behind PyCon tutorials for many years, shaping them into the strong program they are today. She has brought skill, care, and consistency to the difficult work of selecting, organizing, and running tutorials, ensuring they provide meaningful learning experiences for attendees.</p><p>Beyond logistics, Sarah has a gift for spotting and nurturing talent. She has encouraged new volunteers to grow into leadership roles, building a resilient, collaborative committee that sustains itself year after year. Her outreach has kept reviewers engaged while also welcoming fresh voices, strengthening both the program and the community behind it.</p><p>The impact of Sarah’s work is felt by every instructor, attendee, and volunteer who has benefitted from PyCon tutorials, and the community is deeply grateful for her many years of leadership and care. Sarah was also the lead organizer for PyLadies Silicon Valley for over 5 years, is a SoCal Python Co-Organizer, and has contributed to a variety of open source projects.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Rodrigo Girão Serrão</h2><p>Rodrigo Girão Serrão has made lasting contributions to the international Python community through his leadership, teaching, and generosity. He has helped organize PyCons in Portugal, supported the Python community across Europe, and spoken regularly at PyCons worldwide, making complex topics like descriptors clear and approachable.</p><p>Through his website mathspp.com, bootcamps, and self-published books, including the freely available Pydon’ts book, Rodrigo has worked to make Python more accessible and welcoming. His dedication to sharing knowledge and supporting others has had a wide-reaching impact, and the community is grateful for his many contributions.<br /><br /></p>

            <p>There&rsquo;s a proposal, <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0810/">PEP 810 – Explicit lazy imports</a> for Python to natively support lazy importing starting in Python 3.15.</p>
<p>However, it has not been accepted yet, and even if it is accepted, 3.15 is a year away.
What do we do now?</p>
<p>The techniques covered in this post that allow you to use lazy importing NOW with Python 3.13, Python 3.12, &hellip;, really every version of Python.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at a small code example that imports something.</p>

            Python typing got fast enough to feel invisible. Pyrefly is a new, open source type checker and IDE language server from Meta, written in Rust, with a focus on instant feedback and real-world DX. Today, we will dig into what it is, why it exists, and how it plays with the rest of the typing ecosystem. We have Abby Mitchell, Danny Yang, and Kyle Into from Pyrefly here to dive into the project.

<p>I originally wrote this post in 2022 for Python 3.11.<br />
From 2022 through 2024, I remained of the belief that installing from python.org was the best option for most people.</p>
<p>However, 2025 changed that for me, with <code>uv</code> and <code>uv python</code> supporting the installation of Python versions. It&rsquo;s a really pleasant and clean way to keep Python versions up to date and install new versions.</p>

            Python 3.14 is here! Christopher Trudeau returns to discuss the new version with Real Python team member Bartosz Zaczyński. This year, Bartosz coordinated the series of preview articles with members of the Real Python team and wrote the showcase tutorial, "Python 3.14: Cool New Features for You to Try." Christopher's video course, "What's New in Python 3.14", covers the topics from the article and shows the new features in action.

<li><code>uv self update</code></li>
<li><code>uv python install 3.14</code></li>

<p>While it&rsquo;s true that creating a virtual environment with <code>uv venv .venv --python 3.14</code> will install 3.14 if it isn&rsquo;t already there, you still gotta run <code>uv self update</code>. So I just usually install it while I&rsquo;m at it.</p>

            <p>I find myself in the Python REPL <em>a lot</em>.</p>

<p>I open up the REPL to play with an idea, to use Python as a calculator or quick and dirty text parsing tool, to record a screencast, to come up with a code example for an article, and (most importantly for me) to teach Python.
My Python courses and workshops are based largely around writing code together to guess how something works, try it out, and repeat.</p>

<p>As I&rsquo;ve written about before, you can <a href="https://treyhunner.com/2024/10/adding-keyboard-shortcuts-to-the-python-repl/">add custom keyboard shortcuts</a> to the new Python REPL (since 3.13) and <a href="https://treyhunner.com/2025/09/customizing-your-python-repl-color-scheme/">customize the REPL syntax highlighting</a> (since 3.14).
If you spend time in the Python REPL and wish it behaved a little more <strong>like your favorite editor</strong>, these tricks can come in handy.</p>

<p>I have added <strong>custom keyboard shortcuts</strong> to my REPL and other modifications to help me <strong>more quickly write and edit code in my REPL</strong>.
I&rsquo;d like to share some of the modifications that I&rsquo;ve found helpful in my own Python REPL.</p>

<h2>Creating a PYTHONSTARTUP file</h2>

<p>If you want to run Python code every time an interactive prompt (a REPL) starts, you can make a PYTHONSTARTUP file.</p>

<p>When Python launches an interactive prompt, it checks for a <code>PYTHONSTARTUP</code> environment variable.
If it finds one, it treats it as a filename that contains Python code and it <strong>runs all the code in that file</strong>, as if you had copy-pasted the code into the REPL.</p>

<p>So all of the modifications I have made to my Python REPL rely on this <code>PYTHONSTARTUP</code> variable in my <code>~/.zshenv</code> file:</p>

<figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="sh"><span class="line"><span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">PYTHONSTARTUP</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nv">$HOME</span>/.startup.py
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If you use bash, you&rsquo;ll put that in your <code>~/.bashrc</code> file.
If you&rsquo;re on Windows <a href="https://gist.github.com/mitchmindtree/92c8e37fa80c8dddee5b94fc88d1288b">you&rsquo;ll need to set an environment variable the Windows way</a>.</p>

<p>With that variable set, I can now create a <code>~/.startup.py</code> file that has Python code in it.
That code will automatically run every time I launch a new Python REPL, whether within a virtual environment or outside of one.</p>

<h2>My REPL keyboard shortcuts</h2>

<p>The quick summary of my <em>current</em> modifications are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pressing <strong>Home</strong> moves to the <strong>first character in the code block</strong></li>
<li>Pressing <strong>End</strong> moves to the <strong>last character in the code block</strong></li>
<li>Pressing <strong>Alt+M</strong> moves to the <strong>first character</strong> on the current line</li>
<li>Pressing <strong>Shift+Tab</strong> removes <strong>common indentation</strong> from the code block</li>
<li>Pressing <strong>Alt+Up</strong> swaps the current line with <strong>the line above it</strong></li>
<li>Pressing <strong>Alt+Down</strong> swaps the current line with <strong>the line below it</strong></li>
<li>Pressing <strong>Ctrl+N</strong> inserts <strong>a specific list of numbers</strong></li>
<li>Pressing <strong>Ctrl+F</strong> inserts <strong>a specific list of strings</strong></li>
</ul>


<p>If you&rsquo;ve read <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/repl-features/">my Python REPL shortcuts</a> article, you know that we can use <strong>Ctrl+A</strong> to move to the beginning of the line and <strong>Ctrl+E</strong> to move to the end of the line.
I already use those instead of the Home and End keys, so I decided to rebind Home and End to do something different.</p>

<p>The <strong>Alt+M</strong> key combination is essentially the same as <code>Alt+M</code> in Emacs or <code>^</code> in Vim. I usually prefer to move to the beginning of the non-whitespace in a line rather than to the beginning of the <em>entire</em> line.</p>

<p>The <strong>Shift+Tab</strong> functionality is basically a fancy wrapper around <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/dedent/">using <code>textwrap.dedent</code></a>: it dedents the current code block while keeping the cursor over the same character it was at before.</p>

<p>The <strong>Ctrl+N</strong> and <strong>Ctrl+F</strong> shortcuts make it easier for me to grab an example data structure to work with when teaching.</p>

<p>In addition to the above changes, I also modify my color scheme to work nicely with my Solarized Light color scheme in Vim.</p>

<h2>I created a pyrepl-hacks library for this</h2>

<p>My PYTHONSTARTUP file became so messy that I ended up creating a <a href="https://github.com/treyhunner/pyrepl-hacks">pyrepl-hacks library</a> to help me with these modifications.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/treyhunner/dotfiles/commits/main/startup.py">My PYTHONSTARTUP file</a> now looks pretty much like this:</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s pretty short!</p>

<p>But wait&hellip; won&rsquo;t this fail unless pyrepl-hacks is installed in every virtual environment <em>and</em> installed globally for every Python version on my machine?</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s where that <code>sys.path.append</code> trick comes in handy&hellip;</p>

<h2>Wait&hellip; let&rsquo;s acknowledge the dragons 🐲</h2>

<p>At this point I&rsquo;d like to pause to note that all of this relies on using an implementation detail of Python that is deliberately undocumented because it <em>is not designed</em> to be used by end users.</p>

<p>The above code all relies on the <code>_pyrepl</code> module that was added in Python 3.13 (and optionally the <code>_colorize</code> module that was added in Python 3.14).</p>

<p>When I run a new future version of Python (for example Python 3.15) this solution may break.
I&rsquo;m willing to take that risk, as I know that I can always unset my shell&rsquo;s <code>PYTHONSTARTUP</code> variable or clear out my startup file.</p>

<p>So, just be aware&hellip; here be (private undocumented implementation detail) dragons.</p>

<h2>Monkey patching <code>sys.path</code> to allow importing <code>pyrepl_hacks</code></h2>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t install pyrepl-hacks <em>the usual way</em>.
Instead, I installed it in a very specific location.</p>

<p>I created a <code>~/.pyhacks</code> directory and then installed <code>pyrepl-hacks</code> <em>into</em> that directory:</p>

<figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="bash"><span class="line"><span class="nv">$ </span>mkdir -p ~/.pyhacks
</span><span class="line"><span class="nv">$ </span>python -m pip install pyrepl-hacks --target ~/.pyhacks
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>In order for the <code>pyrepl_hacks</code> Python package to work, it needs to available within every Python REPL I might launch.
Normally that would mean that it needs to be installed in every virtual environment that Python runs within.
This trick avoids that constraint.</p>

<p>When Python tries to import a module, it iterates through the <code>sys.path</code> directory list.
Any Python packages found <em>within</em> any of the <code>sys.path</code> directories may be imported.</p>

<p>So monkey patching <code>sys.path</code> within my PYTHONSTARTUP file allows <code>pyrepl_hacks</code> to be imported in every Python interpreter I launch:</p>

<figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="python"><span class="line"><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">pathlib</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">Path</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">sys</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="n">sys</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">path</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">append</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Path</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">home</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="o">/</span> <span class="s">&quot;.pyhacks&quot;</span><span class="p">))</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>With those 3 lines (or something like them) placed in my PYTHONSTARTUP file, all interactive Python interpreters I launch will be able to import modules that are located in my <code>~/.pyhacks</code> directory.</p>

<h2>Creating your own custom REPL commands</h2>

<p>That&rsquo;s pretty neat.
But what if you want to invent your own REPL commands?</p>

<p>Well, the <code>bind</code> utility I&rsquo;ve created in the <code>pyrepl_hacks</code> module can be used as a decorator for that.</p>

<p>This will make Ctrl+X followed by Ctrl+R insert <code>import subprocess</code> followed by <code>subprocess.run("", shell=True)</code> with the cursor positioned in between the double quotes after it&rsquo;s all inserted:</p>

<p>You can read more about the ins and outs of the pyrepl-hacks package <a href="https://github.com/treyhunner/pyrepl-hacks#readme">in the readme file</a>.</p>

<h2>pyrepl-hacks is just a fancy wrapper</h2>

<p>The pyrepl-hacks package is really just a fancy wrapper around Python&rsquo;s <code>_pyrepl</code> and <code>_colorize</code> modules.</p>

<p>Why did I make a whole package and then modify my <code>sys.path</code> to use it, when I could have just used <code>_pyrepl</code> directly?</p>

<p>Three reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>To make creating new commands <em>a bit</em> easier (functions can be used instead of classes)</li>
<li>To make the key bindings look a bit nicer (I prefer <code>"Ctrl+M"</code> over <code>r"\C-M"</code>)</li>
<li>To hide my hairy hacks behind a shiny API ✨</li>
</ol>


<p>Before I made pyrepl-hacks, I implemented these commands directly within my PYTHONSTARTUP file by reaching into the internals of <code>_pyrepl</code> directly.</p>

<p>My PYTHONSTARTUP file before pyrepl-hacks was <a href="https://pym.dev/p/35q9e/">over 100 lines longer</a>.</p>

<h2>Try pyrepl-hacks and leave feedback</h2>

<p>My hope is that the <a href="https://github.com/treyhunner/pyrepl-hacks">pyrepl-hacks</a> library will be obsolete one day.
Eventually the <code>_pyrepl</code> module might be renamed to <code>pyrepl</code> (or maybe just <code>repl</code>?) and it will have a well-documented friendly-ish public interface.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I plan to maintain pyrepl-hacks.
As Python 3.15 is developed, I&rsquo;ll make sure it continues to work.
And I may add more useful commands if I think of any.</p>

<p>If you hack your own REPL, I&rsquo;d love to hear what modifications you come up with.
And if you have thoughts on how to improve pyrepl-hacks, please open an issue or get in touch.</p>

<p>Also, <strong>if you use Windows</strong>, <a href="https://github.com/treyhunner/pyrepl-hacks/issues/1">please help me</a> confirm <strong>whether certain keys work on Windows</strong>. Thanks!</p>

<p>Contributions and ideas welcome!</p>

            <p>There&rsquo;s a new release of <a href="https://github.com/okken/pytest-check">pytest-check</a>. Version 2.6.0.</p>
<p>This is a cool contribution from the community.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2>
<p>In July, <a href="https://github.com/bluenote10">bluenote10</a> reported that <code>check.raises()</code> doesn&rsquo;t behave like <code>pytest.raises()</code> in that the <code>AssertionError</code> returned from <code>check.raises()</code> doesn&rsquo;t have a queryable <code>value</code>.</p>
<p>Example of <code>pytest.raises()</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma" tabindex="0"><code class="language-python"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">pytest</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">raises</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ne">Exception</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">e</span><span class="p">:</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    <span class="n">do_something</span><span class="p">()</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="k">assert</span> <span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">e</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">value</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s2">"&lt;expected error message&gt;"</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>We&rsquo;d like <code>check.raises()</code> to act similarly:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma" tabindex="0"><code class="language-python"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">check</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">raises</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ne">Exception</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">e</span><span class="p">:</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    <span class="n">do_something</span><span class="p">()</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="k">assert</span> <span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">e</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">value</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s2">"&lt;expected error message&gt;"</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>But that didn&rsquo;t work prior to 2.6.0. The issue was that the value returned from <code>check.raises()</code> didn&rsquo;t have any <code>.value</code> atribute.</p>

<p>Do not overcrowd your functions with logic for four or five different things.
A function should do a single thing, and it should do it well, and the name of the function should clearly tell you what your function does.</p>
<p>If you are unsure about whether some piece of code should be a single function or multiple functions, it's best to err on the side of too many functions.
That is because a function is a modular piece of code, and the smaller your functions are, the easier it is to compose them together to create more complex behaviours.</p>
<p>Consider the function <code>process_order</code> defined below, an exaggerated example that breaks these best practices to make the point clearer.
While it is not incredibly long, it does too many things:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">def process_order(order):
    # Validate the order:
    for item, quantity, price in order:
        if quantity &lt;= 0:
            raise ValueError(f"Cannot buy 0 or less of {item}.")
        if price &lt;= 0:
            raise ValueError(f"Price must be positive.")

    # Write the receipt:
    total = 0
    with open("receipt.txt", "w") as f:
