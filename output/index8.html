<h3 class="title-3">AI Assisted Development</h3>
<p>Wing Pro 10 takes advantage of recent advances in the capabilities of generative AI to
provide powerful AI assisted development, including AI code suggestion, AI driven code
refactoring, description-driven development, and AI chat. You can ask Wing to use AI to
(1) implement missing code at the current input position, (2) refactor, enhance, or extend
existing code by describing the changes that you want to make, (3) write new code from a
description of its functionality and design, or (4) chat in order to work through
understanding and making changes to code.</p>
<p>Examples of requests you can make include:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&quot;Add a docstring to this method&quot;
&quot;Create unit tests for class SearchEngine&quot;
&quot;Add a phone number field to the Person class&quot;
&quot;Clean up this code&quot;
&quot;Convert this into a Python generator&quot;
&quot;Create an RPC server that exposes all the public methods in class BuildingManager&quot;
&quot;Change this method to wait asynchronously for data and return the result with a callback&quot;
&quot;Rewrite this threaded code to instead run asynchronously&quot;
</pre>
<p>Yes, really!</p>
<p>Your role changes to one of directing an intelligent assistant capable of completing a
wide range of programming tasks in relatively short periods of time. Instead of typing out
code by hand every step of the way, you are essentially directing someone else to work
through the details of manageable steps in the software development process.</p>

          <p class="text-base-content">
            Here's an unanswered question:


  I have money and I have a URL, how do I send money to the publisher of that URL?


URLs tell you where to get content on the web, but they don't tell you
anything about how to support the person who created the content.
This story might sound similar to paying open source maintainers,
where a user can almost abstract an entire project to a single download URL.

There are tons of people creating content for the web and plenty of ways to get
paid (Patreon, Kofi, GitHub Sponsors, YouTube Paid Membership),
but there's no standardized way to direct someone interested in paying for
the content of a page in the right direction.

We have HTML meta headers for many things, including where to find an RSS feed
or what my Fediverse handle is, but none for enumerating options to pay the creator of the content.
I wish I could click a button to easily send a "tip" to someone who created something I enjoy
or to browse other options for supporting them.

Existing technology

Payment Request API

There are things like the web "Payment Request API" which gives you a JavaScript
API for generating a payment, but this doesn't fit my criteria.

For one: this means that every person creating content for the web needs to
add JavaScript to their page. This is a much higher bar than simply linking to existing payment methods
that a creator already likely uses to get paid. Being difficult means it's unlikely
for large numbers of people to do the work.

I also don't see being able to automate this because of the JavaScript.
Web creators likely have existing payment pages that they'd much rather link
out to instead of trying to handle payments themselves individually.

Lastly, this API exists and I don't see it being used by creators today.
That should say something about either its ease-of-use or return on investment
from potential supporters.

Linking to payment methods in the page

Yeah, we could scrape the payment URLs we know about embedded in the page. But
there's a difference between potential URLs in the page due to non-creator
generated content (links in comments, etc) and whatever the "authoritative"
URLs are for paying the creator of the page. Being able to set &lt;meta&gt; tags
in &lt;head&gt; is typically a higher bar than setting arbitrary URLs in the &lt;body&gt;.

Podcasting 2.0 RSS &lt;podcast:funding&gt; tag

Podcasting 2.0 supports basically the exact tag that
I want to use which encodes a URL and  a human-readable name for that URL
into the metadata description of a podcast publication. Really great to see some prior art here.

Thanks to DamonHD for sending me this reference.

Web Monetization and Payment Link

Both of these are existing monetization / payment web standards, these
look to be mostly what I'd need to scrape an identifier from a page.

Both are fairly similar from first reading, there's Web Monetization and
and the newer Payment Link.

Flattr

Flattr is a service that tried to turn a "subscription" from users into micro-payouts
based on a users' browsing history. Flattr shut down in 2023. This approach isn't one I'm interested in replicating for
a few reasons:


Access to the entire browsing history feels like a privacy nightmare.
Yes you receive a "complete" sample of which web pages a user has visited
but, yeah this doesn't seem great?
Flattr tried to create its own payment platform for creators, rather than
pushing users to send monetary support through existing stable payment methods
like Patreon. They had to do this because of the micro-payments thing.


In general this is making me think micro-payments is extremely hard to do.
I think having a handful of dedicated fans for small creators might be enough
to "offset" the "loss" of micro-payments? Perhaps there can be a recommendation
to note to users when certain creators are "niche" and therefore are receiving
fewer payments relative to other creators and thus would benefit more from
a contribution / boost?

Thanks to Quentin for sending me this reference.

Brave

I know about Brave, and I would like to avoid crypto in my solution. Also many of the
creators I pay for don't use crypto but do have multiple payment methods. I don't think
the solution should require creators AND users adopt new technology to work.

Why federate just the social web?

Article by Pelle Westman on the monetary and media web being federated,
not only the social web from 2012.

What happens now?

I'm no stranger to standards, so maybe I do some research and
write a web standard proposal? Seems like fun! I'm imagining something like:


&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;!-- ... --&gt;
    &lt;meta property=&quot;financial-support&quot; content=&quot;https://patreon.com/c/MatthewCarlson&quot;&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;



Because this is primarily for money, no doubt it will be abused to hell.
First-party browsers probably wouldn't do anything with this information
for the fear of legitimizing scammers' fake profiles.

The existence of the "Web Payments API" makes me think maybe it's not
a huge deal and that whenever money gets involved peoples' spidey-senses
start going off about whether a page is legitimate? Not sure.

Let me know what you think!

            If you are a .NET developer or work in a place that has some of those folks, wouldn't it be great to fully leverage the entirety of PyPI with it's almost 600,000 packages inside your .NET code? But how would you do this? Previous efforts have let you write Python syntax but using the full libraries (especially the C-based ones) has been out of reach, until CSnakes. This project by Anthony Shaw and Aaron Powell unlocks some pretty serious integration between the two languages. We have them both here on the show today to tell us all about it.

            This critical role would not be possible without funding from the Alpha-Omega project.
  


TLDR: Skip intro, take me to the visualization!

I'm working on improving measurability of Python packages by allowing Software Bill-of-Materials documents (SBOM) to be included in Python packages so that projects and build tools can record information about a package for downstream use.

This is a cross-functional project where I need input from Python projects, Python packaging tools (build backends+tools and installers), but also from folks completely outside the Python community like SBOM tooling maintainers.
With projects like this, it can be difficult to "see the forest through the trees". When you're reviewing the packaging PEP, it can be difficult to imagine how or who is using the new standard. This article is to help visualize the end-to-end data flow.

How SBOM data will be included in Python packages

In short, the proposal is:


Allow Python projects to manually specify SBOM documents
in pyproject.toml with [project].sbom-files = ["..."]
Allow Python package archives to include self-describing
SBOM documents and reference them in metadata via Sbom-File field.
Zero-or-more SBOM documents per Python package archive.
Each tool adding SBOM data creates a new SBOM inside the archive to avoid conflicts.
End-user SBOM tools need to handle multiple SBOMs to "stitch" them together.


End-to-end SBOM data flow

There are two Python packages being shown, Package A on the left and Package B on the right.
Package A depends on Package B. Package A is a pure-Python package with no bundled dependencies.
Package B uses binary extensions and uses auditwheel to bundle shared libraries.

How SBOM data flows from Python package source code, build, to an SBOM generation tool



Stage 1: If the Python project bundles third-party software in their own source code then the project may specify one or more SBOM documents through project.sbom-files in pyproject.toml. Build backends copy these documents into source distributions and wheels.
Stage 2: If the Python build-backend pulls dependencies (like Maturin and Cargo) while building a wheel those dependencies can be recorded in another SBOM document in the wheel.
Stage 3: If a tool that modifies wheels by adding dependencies is used (like auditwheel) then that tool can record modifications in an SBOM document. At this point there are three separate SBOM documents included in the Package B archive.
Stage 4: Archives are uploaded to an index like PyPI. The index can do some validation of included SBOM documents, if any.



Stage 5: Installers download and install the Python package archives. The SBOM files are placed into the .dist-info/sboms/ directory in the Python environment and referenced in package metadata.

Stage 6: SBOM generation tools scan the Python environment and using existing Python package metadata and new SBOM documents with per-package data stitch together an Operational SBOM (OBOM) detailing the Python environment.

Who does what?

The plan is to allow each "actor" in the system adding SBOM data to a Python package
to create their own SBOM document inside the Python package.

This means they can choose any SBOM standard (although we'll recommend
sticking to a well-known one like CycloneDX and SPDX) and that intermediate tools won't need to "merge" SBOM data together.
Avoiding this merging is extremely important, because cross-standard SBOM data merges are a very hard problem. This problem is deferred to SBOM generation tools which already need to support multiple SBOM standards.


Pure-Python projects that don't vendor software are easy, there's nothing to do here.
Python projects that vendor software can annotate that software using an SBOM and specify the SBOM in pyproject.toml.
Keeping this up-to-date is a non-zero amount of work, but I am hoping that by providing this PEP it will enable these types of contributions.
I'm also hoping to provide a lightweight pre-commit hook to help keeping these SBOM documents up-to-date, similar to what CPython already uses.
Python project which use a build backend that pull dependencies should be able to annotate what those dependencies are at build time.
There will be exceptions, looking into tools like Meson and multibuild to see what can be done.
Python bundling tools like auditwheel, delocate, etc can annotate shared libraries and DLLs that are pulled into wheels.


My hope is that the most difficult part of this work (manually annotating a package if automatic tools can't)
will enable a new type of contribution from users of Python packages to provide SBOM data. Previously
there was no standardized method to have SBOM data propagate through Python packages, thus discouraged this
type of contribution.

            Very often, backend devs don't want to write code.<br /><br />
For this, we use one trick : derive HTML widget for presentation, database access, REST endpoints from ONE SOURCE of truth and we call it MODEL.<br /><br />
A tradition, and I insist it's a conservative tradition, is to use a declarative model where we mad the truth of the model from python classes.<br /><br />
By declaring a class we will implicitly declare it's SQL structure, the HTML input form for human readable interaction and the REST endpoint to access a graph of objects which are all mapped on the database.<br /><br />
Since the arrival of pydantic it makes all the more sense when it comes to empower a strongly type approach in python.<br /><br />
But is it the only one worthy ?<br /><br />
I speak here as a veteran of the trenchline which job is to read a list of entries of customer in an xls file from a project manager and change the faulty value based on the retro-engineering of an HTML formular into whatever the freak the right value is supposed to be.<br /><br />
In this case your job is in fact to short circuit the web framework to which you don't have access to change values directly into the database. <br /><br />
More often than never is these real life case you don't have access to the team who built the framework (to much bureaucracy to even get a question answered before the situation gets critical) ... So you look at the form. <br /><br />
And you guess the name of the table that is impacted by looking at the « network tab » in the developper GUI when you hit the submit button.<br /><br />
And you guess the name of the field impacted in the table to guess the name of the columns.<br /><br />
And then you use your only magical tool which is a write access to the database to reflect the expected object with an automapper and change values.<br /><br />
You could do it raw SQL I agree, but sometimes you need to do a web query in the middle to change the value because you have to ask a REST service what is the new ID of the client.<br /><br />
And you see the more this experience of having to tweak into real life frameworks that often surprise users for the sake of the limitation of the source of truth, the more I want the HTML to be the source of truth.<br /><br />
The most stoïcian approach to full stack framework approach : to derive <b>Everything</b> from an HTML page. <br /><br />
The views, the controllers, the route, the model in such a true way that if you modify the HTML you modify in real time the database model, the routes, the displayed form.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<h1>What are the advantages of HTML as a declarative language ?</h1>
<br /><br />
Here, one of the tradition is to prefere the human readable languages such as YAML and JSON, or machine readable as XML over HTML.<br /><br />
However, JSON and YAML are more limited in expressiveness of data structure than HTML (you can have a dict as a key in a dict in json ? Me I can.)<br /><br />
And on the other hand XML is quite a pain to read and write without mistakes.<br /><br />
<h2>HTML is just XML</h2>
<br /><br />
HTML is a lax and lenient grammarless XML. No parsers will raise an exception because you wrote "&lt;br>" instead of "&lt;br/>"  (or the opposite). You can add non existent attributes to tags and the parser will understand this easily without you having to redefine a full fledge grammar.<br /><br />

<h2>HTML is an XML YOU CAN SEE.</h2>
<br /><br />There are some tags that are related to a grammar of visual widget to which non computer people are familiar with.<br /><br />
If you use a FORM as a mapping to a database table, and all input inside has A column name you have already input drawn on your screen.<br /><br />
<br /><br /><h2>Modern « remote procedure call » are web based</h2>
<br /><br />
Call it RPC, call it soap, call it REST, nowadays the web technologies trust 99% of how computer systems exchange data between each others.<br /><br />
You buy something on the internet, at the end you interact with a web formular or a web call. Hence, we can assert with strong convictions that 100% of web technologies can serve web pages. Thus, if you use your html as a model and present it, therefore you can deduce the data model from the form without needing a new pivoting language.
<br /><br /><h1>Proof of concept</h1>
<br /><br />
For the convenience of « fun » we are gonna imagine a backend for « agile by micro blogging » (à la former twitter).<br /><br />We are gonna assume the platform is structured micro blogging around where agile shines the most : not when things are done, but to move things on.<br /><br />
Things that are done will be called statements. Like : « software is delivered. Here is a factoid (a git url for instance) ». We will call this nodes in a graph and are they will be supposed to immutable states that can't be contested.<br /><br />
Each statement answers another statement's factoid like a delivery statement tends to follow a story point (at least should lead by the mean of a transition.<br /><br />
Hence in this application we will mirco-blog about the transition ... like on a social network with members of concerned group.<br />
The idea of the application is to replace scrum meetings with micro blogging.<br /><br />
Are you blocked ? Do you need anything ? Can be answered on the mirco blogging platform, and every threads that are presented archived, used for machine learning (about what you want to hear as a good news) in a data form that is convenient for large language model.<br /><br />
As such we want to harvest a text long enough to express emotions, constricted to a laughingly small amount of characters so that finesse and ambiguity are tough to raise. That's the heart of the application : harvesting comments tagged with associated emotions to ease the work of tagging for Artificial Intelligence.<br /><br />
Hear me out, this is just a stupid idea of mine to illustrate a graph like structure described with HTML, not a real life idea. Me I just love to represent State Machine Diagram with everything that fall under my hands.
<br /><br />
Here is the entity relationship diagram I have in mind : 
<div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgy_46qmWzRXSDzThWgTjxAK96tMBx1qGoiGFweqEi7fD33Omctnwk_UMSh6CM5hmbgA2S-gTo4yeWKLDbbUuRdJQK0puf_Y4h5xSr7tL7_deJdZ2sEYySu30HO57gmHsM28kkFmh_WRB3ZCbOiNkfZnyRE42IFJf_Y1xWnlBq21th1zfFjXFILTE9W_rM/s1600/diag.png" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center;"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgy_46qmWzRXSDzThWgTjxAK96tMBx1qGoiGFweqEi7fD33Omctnwk_UMSh6CM5hmbgA2S-gTo4yeWKLDbbUuRdJQK0puf_Y4h5xSr7tL7_deJdZ2sEYySu30HO57gmHsM28kkFmh_WRB3ZCbOiNkfZnyRE42IFJf_Y1xWnlBq21th1zfFjXFILTE9W_rM/s1600/diag.png" width="1000" /></a></div>
<br /><br />Let's see what a table declaration might look like in HTML, let's say <b>transition</b> : 
<pre>


&lt;form action=/transition  &gt;
	&lt;input type=number name=id /&gt;
	&lt;input type=number name=user_group_id nullable=false reference=user_group.id /&gt;
	&lt;textarea name=message rows=10 cols=50 nullable=false &gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;
	&lt;input type=url name=factoid /&gt;
	&lt;select name=&quot;emotion_for_group_triggered&quot; value=neutral &gt;
		&lt;option value=&quot;&quot;&gt;please select a value&lt;/option&gt;
		&lt;option value=positive &gt;Positive&lt;/option&gt;
		&lt;option value=neutral &gt;Neutral&lt;/option&gt;
		&lt;option value=negative &gt;Negative&lt;/option&gt;
	&lt;/select&gt;
	&lt;input type=number name=expected_fun_for_group /&gt;
	&lt;input type=number name=previous_statement_id reference=statement.id nullable=false /&gt;
	&lt;input type=number name=next_statement_id reference=statement.id /&gt;
	&lt;unique_constraint col=next_statement_id,previous_statement_id name=unique_transition &gt;&lt;/unique_constraint&gt;
	&lt;input type=checkbox name=is_exception /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;


</pre>
Through the use of additionnal tags of html and attributes we can convey a lot of informations usable for database construction/querying that are gonna be silent at the presentation (like unique_constraint).

And with a little bit of javascript and CSS this html generate the following rendering (indicating the webservices endpoint as input type=submit : 
<div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgc5PPXqZCSApxR7QnQSHAVym3SS2_GHJGHbpzp6MXwFL-g4Z061Zjr1zFvbRMWQfVell4NivkAA_hfZIb8v2LorrG4doLYhPPgWVsLpCBdapLic5w5VVg7YfCLzznai0LvEZLO_7dFAJVtFuR2EMe0fdpTsVuHs-fE0PQasKpq676d3j8aFGefF6fMXHo/s1600/Screenshot%202024-11-20%20at%2009-37-15%20.png" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center;"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgc5PPXqZCSApxR7QnQSHAVym3SS2_GHJGHbpzp6MXwFL-g4Z061Zjr1zFvbRMWQfVell4NivkAA_hfZIb8v2LorrG4doLYhPPgWVsLpCBdapLic5w5VVg7YfCLzznai0LvEZLO_7dFAJVtFuR2EMe0fdpTsVuHs-fE0PQasKpq676d3j8aFGefF6fMXHo/s1600/Screenshot%202024-11-20%20at%2009-37-15%20.png" /></a></div>
<br /><br />

Meaning that you can now serve a landing page that serve the purpose of human interaction, describing a « curl way » of automating interaction and a full model of your database.<br /><br />
Most startup think data model should be obfuscated to prevent being copied, most free software project thinks that sharing the non valuable assets helps adopt the technology.
<br /><br />
And thanks to this, I can now create my own test suite that is using the HTML form to work on a doppleganger of the real database by parsing the HTML served by the application service (pdca.py) and launch a perfectly functioning service out of it:

                "date" in k or "time" in k and v and type(k) == str )
                    and parser.parse(v) or

                k.startswith("is_") and [False, True][v == "on"] or

                "password" in k and crypto_hash.hash(v) or
                v
                for k,v in attrs.items() if v  and not k.startswith("_")
}

post(url("user"), params = dict(id=1,  secret_password="toto", name="jul2", email="j@j.com", _action="create"), files=dict(pic_file=open("./assets/diag.png", "rb").read())).status_code

<p><strong>This is an early developer preview of Python
3.14</strong></p>
<h1 id="major-new-features-of-the-3.14-series-compared-to-3.13">Major
new features of the 3.14 series, compared to 3.13</h1>
<p>Python 3.14 is still in development. This release, 3.14.0a2 is the
second of seven planned alpha releases.</p>
<p>Alpha releases are intended to make it easier to test the current
state of new features and bug fixes and to test the release process.</p>
<p>During the alpha phase, features may be added up until the start of
the beta phase (2025-05-06) and, if necessary, may be modified or
deleted up until the release candidate phase (2025-07-22). Please keep
in mind that this is a preview release and its use is
<strong>not</strong> recommended for production environments.</p>
<p>Many new features for Python 3.14 are still being planned and
written. Among the new major new features and changes so far:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0649/">PEP 649</a>: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#pep-649-deferred-evaluation-of-annotations">deferred
evaluation of annotations</a></li>
<li><a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0741/">PEP 741</a>: Python
configuration C API</li>
<li><a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0761/">PEP 761</a>: Python 3.14
and onwards no longer provides PGP signatures for release artifacts.
Instead, Sigstore is recommended for verifiers.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#improved-error-messages">Improved
error messages</a></li>
<li><small>(Hey, <strong>fellow core developer,</strong> if a feature
you find important is missing from this list, let Hugo
know.)</small></li>
</ul>
<p>The next pre-release of Python 3.14 will be 3.14.0a3, currently
scheduled for 2024-12-17.</p>

then 1, 2, and so on. It has the same effect as if we had written it:</p><blockquote class="code"><pre class="python"><div class="source"><span class="k">for</span>&#xa0;<span class="n">page_num</span>&#xa0;<span class="ow">in</span>&#xa0;<span class="n">itertools</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">count</span><span class="p">():</span>

</pre></blockquote><p><a href="https://hachyderm.io/@nedbat/113498200513086976" rel="external noopener">One reply</a> asked if there was a new params dict in each
iteration.  No, loops in Python do not create a scope, and never make new
variables.  The loop target is assigned to exactly as if it were an assignment
statement.</p><p>As a <a href="https://pythondiscord.com/" rel="external noopener">Python Discord</a> helper once
described it,</p><blockquote><div><p>While loops are &#8220;if&#8221; on repeat. For loops are assignment on
repeat.</p></div></blockquote><p>A loop like <code>for &lt;ANYTHING&gt; in &lt;ITER&gt;:</code> will take successive
values from <code>&lt;ITER&gt;</code> and do an assignment exactly as this statement
would: <code>&lt;ANYTHING&gt; = &lt;VAL&gt;</code>.  If the assignment statement is
ok, then the for loop is ok.</p><p>We&#8217;re used to seeing for loops that do more than a simple assignment:</p><blockquote class="code"><pre class="python"><div class="source"><span class="k">for</span>&#xa0;<span class="n">i</span><span class="p">,</span>&#xa0;<span class="n">thing</span>&#xa0;<span class="ow">in</span>&#xa0;<span class="nb">enumerate</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">things</span><span class="p">):</span>

<br />&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;<span class="o">...</span>
<br /></div>
</pre></blockquote><p>These work because Python can assign to a number of variables at once:</p><blockquote class="code"><pre class="python"><div class="source"><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">,</span>&#xa0;<span class="n">thing</span>&#xa0;<span class="o">=</span>&#xa0;<span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span>&#xa0;<span class="s2">&quot;hello&quot;</span>

<br /></div>
</pre></blockquote><p>Assigning to a dict key (or an attribute, or a property setter, and so on) in
a for loop is an example of Python having a few independent mechanisms that
combine in uniform ways.  We aren&#8217;t used to seeing exotic combinations, but you
can reason through how they would behave, and you would be right.</p><p>You can assign to a dict key in an assignment statement, so you can assign to
it in a for loop.  You might decide it&#8217;s too unusual to use, but it is
possible and it works.</p>

<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>This is the first in a series of articles about automation of and integrations with Microsoft 365 cloud products
using Python and Zato.</p>
<p>We start off with IMAP automation by showing how to
create a scheduled Python service that periodically pulls latest emails from Outlook using OAuth2-based connections.</p>

<h2 id="imap-and-oauth2">IMAP and OAuth2</h2>
<p>Microsoft 365 requires for all IMAP connections to use OAuth2. This can be challenging to configure
in server-side automation and orchestration processes so Zato offers an easy way that lets you read and send emails
without a need for getting into low-level OAuth2 details.</p>
<p>Consider a common orchestration scenario - a business partner sends automated emails with attachments that
need to be parsed, some information needs to be extracted and processed accordingly.</p>
<p>Before OAuth2, an automation process would receive from Azure administrators a dedicated IMAP account with a username
and password.</p>
<p>Now, however, in addition to creating an IMAP account, administrators will need to create and configure a few more
resources that the orchestration service will use. Note that the password to the IMAP account will never be used.</p>
<p>Administrators need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Register an Azure client app representing your service that uses IMAP</li>
<li>Grant this app a couple of Microsoft Graph application permissions:</li>
<li>Mail.ReadWrite</li>
<li>Mail.Send</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, administrators need to give you a few pieces of information about the app:</p>
<ul>
<li>Application (client) ID</li>
<li>Tenant (directory) ID</li>
<li>Client secret</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, you still need to receive the IMAP username (an e-mail address). It is just that you do not need its
corresponding password.</p>
<h2 id="in-dashboard">In Dashboard</h2>
<p>The first step is to create a new connection in your Zato Dashboard - this will establish an OAuth2-using connection
that Zato will manage and your Python code will not have to do anything else,
all the underlying OAuth2 tokens will keep refreshing as needed, the platform will take care of everything.</p>
<p>Having received the configuration details from Azure administrators, you can open your Zato Dashboard and navigate
to IMAP connections:</p>
<p><img src="https://upcdn.io/kW15bqq/raw/root/static/blog/images/3.2-imap/ms365-imap-menu.png" /></p>
<p>Fill out the form as below, choosing "Microsoft 365" as the server type. The other type, "Generic IMAP" is used for
the classical case of IMAP with a username and password:</p>
<p><img src="https://upcdn.io/kW15bqq/raw/root/static/blog/images/3.2-imap/ms365-imap-create-form.png" /></p>
<p>Change the secret and click Ping to confirm that the connection is configured correctly:</p>
<p><img src="https://upcdn.io/kW15bqq/raw/root/static/blog/images/3.2-imap/ms365-imap-secret-ping.png" /></p>
<h2 id="in-python">In Python</h2>
<p>Use the code below to receive emails. Note that it merely needs to refer to a connection definition by its
name and there is no need for any usage of OAuth2 here:</p>

<p>This is everything that is needed for integrations with IMAP using Microsoft 365 although we can still go further.
For instance, to create a scheduled job to periodically invoke the service, go to the Scheduler job
in Dashboard:</p>
<p><img src="https://upcdn.io/kW15bqq/raw/root/static/blog/images/3.2-imap/imap-scheduler-menu.png" /></p>
<p>In this case, we decide to have a job that runs once per hour:</p>
<p><img src="https://upcdn.io/kW15bqq/raw/root/static/blog/images/3.2-imap/imap-scheduler-form.png" /></p>
<p>As expected, clicking OK will suffice for the job to start in background. It is as simple as that.</p>

The <a href="http://python.org/psf">Python Software Foundation</a> (PSF) is the charitable organization behind Python, dedicated to advancing, supporting, and protecting the Python programming language and the community that sustains it. That mission and cause are more than just words we believe in. Our tiny but mighty team works hard to deliver the projects and services that allow Python to be the thriving, independent, community-driven language it is today. Some of what the PSF does includes producing <a href="https://us.pycon.org">PyCon US</a>, hosting the <a href="http://pypi.org">Python Packaging Index</a> (PyPI), <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/grants/">awarding grants</a> to Python initiatives worldwide, <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/about/">maintaining critical community infrastructure</a>, and more.
<br /><br />
To build the future of Python and sustain the thriving community that its users deserve, we need your help. By backing the PSF, you’re investing in Python’s growth and health, and your contributions directly impact the language's future. <b>Is your community, work, or hobby powered by Python?

<br />
<p><b><font size="+1">Highlights from 2024:</font></b></p>
<ul>
<li><b> A record-making PyCon US</b> - We produced the <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2024/">21st PyCon US</a>, in Pittsburgh, US, and online, and it was a huge success! For the first time post-2020, PyCon US 2024 sold out with over 2,500 in-person attendees. </li>

<li><b>Advances in our Grants Program</b> - 2024 has been a year of change and reflection for the Grants Program, starting with the addition of Marie Nordin to the grants administration team who has supported the PSF in launching several new grants initiatives. We set up <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/02/introducing-psf-grants-office-hours.html">Grants Program Office Hours</a>, published a <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/05/psf-grants-program-2022-2023.html">Grants Program Transparency Report</a> for 2022 and 2024, invested in a <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/03/djangocon-africa-grant-process.html">third-party retrospective</a>, <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/07/psf-board-update-on-improvements-to-psf.html">launched a major refresh</a> of all areas of our Grants program and <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/11/psf-grants-program-updates-part2.html">updated our Grants Workgroup Charter</a>. With more changes to come, we are thrilled to share that we awarded a record-breaking amount of grant funds in 2024!</li>

<li><b>Empowering the Python community through Fiscal Sponsorship</b> - We are proud to continue supporting our 20 fiscal sponsoree organizations with their initiatives and events all year round. The PSF provides 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status to fiscal sponsorees such as PyLadies and Pallets, and provides back office support so they can focus on their missions. Consider <a href="https://linktr.ee/thepsf">donating to your favorite PSF Fiscal Sponsoree</a> and check out our <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/fiscal-sponsorees/">Fiscal Sponsorees page</a> to learn more about what each of these awesome organizations is all about!
</li>

<li><b>Connecting directly through Office Hours</b> - The current PSF Board has decided to invest more in connecting and serving the global Python community by establishing a forum to have regular conversations. The <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/board/">board members of the PSF</a> with the support of <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/records/staff/">PSF staff</a> are now holding monthly <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/08/ask-questions-or-tell-us-what-you-think.html">PSF Board Office Hours</a> on the <a href="https://discord.gg/4Hm36PPgpG">PSF Discord</a>. The Office Hours are sessions where folks from the community can share with us how we can help your regional community, express perspectives, and provide feedback for the PSF.</li>

<li><b>Paying more engineers to work directly on Python, PyPI, and security</b> - We welcomed <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/01/announcing-deputy-developer-in.html">Petr Viktorin, Deputy Developer in Residence (DiR), and Serhiy Storchaka, Supporting DiR</a>. It’s been exciting to begin to realize the full vision of the DiR program, with special thanks to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/company/">Bloomberg</a> for making it possible for us to bring Petr on board. The DiR team is taking an active role in shaping the development of the language, and with three people on the team each DiR can now also spend a percentage of their time on feature work aligned with their interests.</li>

<li><b>Continuing to enhance Python’s security through Developers-in-Residence</b> - Seth Larson, PSF Security Developer in Residence (DiR) had a busy year thanks to continued support from <a href="https://alpha-omega.dev">Alpha-Omega</a>. Seth worked on a variety of projects including the creation of SBOMs for Source and Windows CPython artifacts, implementing build reproducibility for CPython source artifacts, and auditing and migrating Sigstore, to name just a few. Check out <a href="https://sethmlarson.dev/blog">Seth's blog</a> to keep up to date with his work. Mike Fiedler, PyPI Safety &amp; Security Engineer, also worked on a variety of projects such as two-factor authentication for all users on PyPI, an audit of PyPI, made significant progress on malware response and reporting, collaborated on the PSF’s submission for the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)’s Request for Information (RFI), and more! Thanks to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/opensource/">AWS</a> and <a href="https://www.georgetown.edu/">Georgetown</a> for making Mike’s PyPI security accomplishments possible. Stay up to date with Mike's work on the <a href="https://blog.pypi.org/">PyPI blog</a>.</li>

<li><b>New PSF Staff dedicated to critical infrastructure</b> - We established the <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/07/announcing-our-new-pypi-support.html">PyPI Support Specialist role, filled by Maria Ashna</a>. Over the past <i><b>23 years</b></i>, PyPI has seen essentially exponential growth in traffic and users, relying for the most part on volunteers to support it. The load far outstretched volunteers and prior staff capacity, so we are very excited to have Maria on board. We also filled our <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/07/announcing-our-new-infrastructure.html">Infrastructure Engineer role, welcoming Jacob Coffee</a> to the team, to ensure PSF-maintained systems and services are running smoothly.<font size="+1"><b> <br /></b></font></li></ul><div style="text-align: left;"><font size="+1"><b>&nbsp;</b></font></div><div style="text-align: left;"><font size="+1"><b>Our thanks!</b></font></div><p></p>
Every dollar you contribute to the PSF helps power Python, makes an impact, and tells us you value Python and the work we do. Python and the PSF are built on the amazing generosity and energy of all our amazing community members out there who step up and give back.<p>We appreciate you and we’re so excited to see where we can go together in the year to come!</p>
