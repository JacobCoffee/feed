<p>A few weeks ago I released Johnnycanencrypt
<a href="https://github.com/kushaldas/johnnycanencrypt/releases/tag/v0.17.0">0.17.0</a>.
It is a Python module written in Rust, which provides OpenPGP functionality
including allows usage of Yubikey 4/5 as smartcards.</p>
<h2>Added</h2>
<ul>
<li>Adds <code>verify_userpin</code> and <code>verify_adminpin</code> functions. #186</li>
</ul>
<h2>Fixed</h2>
<ul>
<li>#176 updates kushal's public key and tests.</li>
<li>#177 uses sequoia-openpgp <code>1.22.0</code></li>
<li>#178 uses scriv for changelog</li>
<li>#181 updates pyo3 to <code>0.27.1</code></li>
<li>#42, we now have only acceptable <code>expect</code> calls and no <code>unwrap</code> calls.</li>
<li>Removes <code>cargo clippy</code> warnings.</li>
</ul>
<p>The build system now moved back to <a href="https://www.maturin.rs/">maturin</a>. I
managed to clean up CI, and now testing properly in all 3 platforms (Linux,
Mac, Windows). Till this release I had to manually test the smartcard
functionalities by connecting a Yubikey in Linux/Mac systems, but that will
change for the future releases. More details will come out soon :)</p>

            For years, building interactive widgets in Python notebooks meant wrestling with toolchains, platform quirks, and a mountain of JavaScript machinery. Most developers took one look and backed away slowly. Trevor Manz decided that barrier did not need to exist. His idea was simple: give Python users just enough JavaScript to unlock the web’s interactivity, without dragging along the rest of the web ecosystem. That idea became anywidget, and it is quickly becoming the quiet connective tissue of modern interactive computing. Today we dig into how it works, why it has taken off, and how it might change the way we explore data.

            >
          </h2>
          
        </div>

        <!-- Content Section -->
        <div class="p-4 flex-grow overflow-hidden">
          <p class="text-base-content">
            <p>I&#8217;ve been moving all my MCPs to skills, including the remaining one I still
used: the Sentry MCP<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>.  Previously I had already moved entirely away from
Playwright to a Playwright skill.</p>
<p>In the last month or so there have been discussions about using <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/advanced-tool-use">dynamic tool
loadouts</a> to defer
loading of tool definitions until later.  Anthropic has also been toying around
with the idea of wiring together MCP calls via code, something <a href="/2025/7/3/tools/">I have
experimented with</a>.</p>
<p>I want to share my updated findings with all of this and why the deferred tool
loading that Anthropic came up with does not fix my lack of love for MCP.  Maybe
they are useful for someone else.</p>
<h2>What is a Tool?</h2>
<p>When the agent encounters a tool definition through reinforcement learning or
otherwise, it is encouraged to emit tool calls through special tokens when it
encounters a situation where that tool call would be appropriate.  For all
intents and purposes, tool definitions can only appear between special tool
definition tokens in a system prompt.  Historically this means that you cannot
emit tool definitions later in the conversation state.  So your only real option
is for a tool to be loaded when the conversation starts.</p>
<p>In agentic uses, you can of course compress your conversation state or change
the tool definitions in the system message at any point.  But the consequence is
that you will lose the reasoning traces and also the cache.  In the case of
Anthropic, for instance, this will make your conversation significantly more
expensive.  You would basically start from scratch and pay full token rates plus
cache write cost, compared to cache read.</p>
<p>One recent innovation from Anthropic is deferred tool loading.  You still
declare tools ahead of time in the system message, but they are not injected
into the conversation when the initial system message is emitted.  Instead they
appear at a later point.  The tool definitions however still have to be static
for the entire conversation, as far as I know.  So the tools that could exist
are defined when the conversation starts.  The way Anthropic discovers the tools
is purely by regex search.</p>
<h2>Contrasting with Skills</h2>
<p>This is all quite relevant because even though MCP with deferred loading feels
like it should perform better, it actually requires quite a bit of engineering
on the LLM API side.  The skill system gets away without any of that and, at
least from my experience, still outperforms it.</p>
<p>Skills are really just short summaries of which skills exist and in which file
the agent can learn more about them.  These are proactively loaded into the
context.  So the agent understands in the system context (or maybe somewhere
later in the context) what capabilities it has and gets a link to the manual for
how to use them.</p>
<p>Crucially, skills do not actually load a tool definition into the context.  The
tools remain the same: bash and the other tools the agent already has.  All it
learns from the skill are tips and tricks for how to use these tools more
effectively.</p>
<p>Because the main thing it learns is how to use other command line tools and
similar utilities, the fundamentals of how to chain and coordinate them together
do not actually change.  The reinforcement learning that made the Claude family
of models very good tool callers just helps with these newly discovered tools.</p>
<h2>MCP as Skills?</h2>
<p>So that obviously raises the question: if skills work so well, can I move the
MCP outside of the context entirely and invoke it through the CLI in a similar
way as Anthropic proposes?  The answer is yes, you can, but it doesn&#8217;t work
well.  One option here is Peter Steinberger&#8217;s
<a href="https://github.com/steipete/mcporter">mcporter</a>.  In short, it reads the
<code>.mcp.json</code> files and exposes the MCPs behind it as callable tools:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>npx mcporter call 'linear.create_comment(issueId: &quot;ENG-123&quot;, body: &quot;Looks good!&quot;)'
</pre></div>
<p>And yes, it looks very much like a command line tool that the LLM can invoke.
The problem however is that the LLM does not have any idea about what tools are
available, and now you need to teach it that.  So you might think: why not make
some skills that teach the LLM about the MCPs?  Here the issue for me comes from
the fact that MCP servers have no desire to maintain API stability.  They are
increasingly starting to trim down tool definitions to the bare minimum to
preserve tokens.  This makes sense, but for the skill pattern it&#8217;s not what you
want.  For instance, the Sentry MCP server at one point switched the query
syntax entirely to natural language.  A great improvement for the agent, but my
suggestions for how to use it became a hindrance and I did not discover the
issue straight away.</p>
<p>This is in fact quite similar to Anthropic&#8217;s deferred tool loading: there is no
information about the tool in the context at all.  You <em>need</em> to create a
summary.  The eager loading of MCP tools we have done in the past now has ended
up with an awkward compromise: the description is both too long to eagerly load
it, and too short to really tell the agent how to use it.  So at least
from my experience, you end up maintaining these manual skill summaries for MCP
tools exposed via mcporter or similar.</p>
<h2>Path Of Least Resistance</h2>
<p>This leads me to my current conclusion: I tend to go with what is easiest, which
is to ask the agent to write its own tools as a skill.  Not only does it not
take all that long, but the biggest benefit is that the tool is largely under my
control.  Whenever it breaks or needs some other functionality, I ask the agent
to adjust it.  The Sentry MCP is a great example.  I think it&#8217;s probably one of
the better designed MCPs out there, but I don&#8217;t use it anymore.  In part because
when I load it into the context right away I lose around 8k tokens out of the
box, and I could not get it to work via mcporter.  On the other hand, I have
Claude maintain a skill for me.  And yes, that skill is probably quite buggy and
needs to be updated, but because the agent maintains it, it works out better.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s quite likely that all of this will change, but at the moment manually
maintained skills and agents writing their own tools have become my preferred
way.  I suspect that dynamic tool loading with MCP will become a thing, but it
will probably quite some protocol changes to bring in skill-like summaries and
built-in manuals for the tools.  I also suspect that MCP would greatly benefit
of protocol stability.  The fact that MCP servers keep changing their tool
descriptions at will does not work well with materialized calls and external
tool descriptions in READMEs and skill files.</p>

<ol>
<li id="fn-1">
<p>Keen readers will remember that last time, the last MCP I used was
Playwright.  In the meantime I added and removed two more MCPs: Linear and
Sentry, mostly because of authentication issues and neither having a great
command line interface.<a class="footnote" href="#fnref-1">&#8617;</a></p></li>

          <p class="text-base-content">
            <p>الأجواء في عالم التقنية تبدو مختلفة حالياً، أليس كذلك؟</p>

<p>قبل بضع سنوات، كان الحصول على وظيفة في مجال البيانات أو البرمجة يبدو طريقاً مباشراً وآمناً. تتعلم الأساسيات (Syntax)، تبني معرض أعمال (Portfolio)، وتضمن وظيفتك.  لكن ونحن نتجه نحو عام 2025، شبكة الأمان هذه بدأت تتلاشى .</p>

<p>السبب معروف للجميع. الذكاء الاصطناعي لم يعد مجرد “تريند”؛  إنه موجود بالفعل داخل محررات الأكواد التي نستخدمها يومياً .</p>

<p><strong>ولأنني أعلم أن الكلام النظري وحده لا يكفي لمواجهة هذا التغيير، أحضرت لك اليوم كورس بايثون كامل (مجاناً) لمساعدتك على البدء، ستجد رابطه في نهاية هذه الرسالة.</strong></p>

<p>إذا كان عملك اليومي يعتمد فقط على تحويل تعليمات واضحة إلى كود، فأنت في منطقة خطر .  لدينا الآن أدوات يمكنها كتابة الأكواد الروتينية (Boilerplate)، وبناء جمل SQL قوية، وتصميم واجهات مستخدم (UI) أسرع من أي إنسان .</p>

<p><strong>لكن الخبر الجيد هو أن الوظيفة لا تختفي، بل تنتقل إلى مستوى أعلى .</strong></p>

<p>السوق متعطش حالياً لمن يستطيع التفكير، التصميم، وحل المشكلات المعقدة والفوضوية .  لكي تبقى في المنافسة، يجب أن تتوقف عن كونك “مترجماً” للأوامر البرمجية، وتبدأ في التصرف كـ “مهندس أنظمة” .</p>

<p>إليك كيف تقوم بهذا التحول:</p>

<h3 id="1-فكر-في-الأنظمة-وليس-فقط-في-الأكواد-syntax">1. فكر في الأنظمة، وليس فقط في الأكواد (Syntax)</h3>

<p>معظمنا تعلم البرمجة عن طريق حفظ القواعد.  “هذه حلقة تكرار (Loop)”، أو “هذا كلاس (Class)” .</p>

<p>لكن هندسة البرمجيات الحقيقية تدور حول إدارة الفوضى.</p>

<p>لنأخذ <strong>البرمجة كائنية التوجه (OOP)</strong> كمثال . الأمر لا يتعلق فقط بإنشاء Class لـ “سيارة” أو “موظف”.  إنها طريقة لرسم خريطة لمشكلة تجارية معقدة حتى لا ينهار النظام لاحقاً تحت وطأة التعديلات .  الذكاء الاصطناعي يمكنه كتابة ملف Class في ثوانٍ، لكنه يفتقر إلى الرؤية لتخطيط كيفية تفاعل عشرين كائناً مختلفاً مع بعضهم البعض على مدار العامين المقبلين .</p>

<h3 id="2-لا-تنتظر-التذاكر-tickets">2. لا تنتظر التذاكر (Tickets)</h3>

<p>المطور العادي ينتظر أن تُسند إليه المهام.  المطور ذو القيمة العالية يبحث هو عن المشاكل ليحلها .</p>

<p>كل شركة مليئة بنقاط الاحتكاك وعدم الكفاءة .  فريق التسويق الذي يقوم بتعديل ملف Excel يدوياً كل يوم إثنين، أو فريق العمليات الذي ينسخ الملفات يدوياً بين المجلدات .</p>

<p>أنت بحاجة لتبني عقلية “الأتمتة أولاً” (Automation-First) .  تعلم كتابة السكربتات التي تتعامل مع ملفات النظام، وتنظم البيانات غير المهيكلة، وتتعامل مع الأخطاء بذكاء . إذا انقطع الاتصال، السكربت الضعيف يتوقف ويموت.  الأداة الجيدة تنتظر، تعيد المحاولة، تسجل الخطأ، وتستمر .</p>

<p>في 2025، الوعي بالبيانات (Data Literacy) إلزامي .</p>

<p>يجب أن تفهم هياكل البيانات (Data Structures) بعمق.  لا أتحدث هنا عن اجتياز مقابلات العمل النظرية، بل عن فهم “المقايضات” (Trade-offs) .</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>List vs. Set:</strong> إذا كنت بحاجة للتحقق من وجود عنصر داخل مجموعة مليون مرة، استخدام List سيجعل النظام بطيئاً جداً.  استخدام Set سيقوم بالمهمة فوراً .</li>
  <li><strong>الثبات (Immutability):</strong> معرفة متى تستخدم Tuple بدلاً من List ليعرف المطورون الآخرون أن هذه البيانات <em>ممنوع تغييرها</em> .</li>
</ul>

<p>هذه القرارات الصغيرة هي ما يحدد ما إذا كان التطبيق سيعمل بسلاسة أم سيزحف ببطء .</p>

            <p>Remember the pure, unadulterated joy (and occasional rage) of games like Breakout and Arkanoid? Dodging, bouncing, and strategically smashing bricks for that satisfying <em>thwack</em>?</p>

<p>Well, get ready for <strong>brkrs</strong> – a modern, full-featured brick-breaker that brings all that classic arcade action to a new generation, built with cutting-edge <strong><a href="https://rust-lang.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rust</a></strong> 🦀 and the incredibly flexible <strong><a href="https://bevy.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bevy</a></strong> game engine!</p>

<p><strong>Want to jump straight into the action or peek under the hood? Find everything here:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/cleder/brkrs" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>github.com/cleder/brkrs</strong></a></p>

<p><strong>brkrs</strong> isn't just another clone; it's a love letter to the genre, packed with modern physics, dynamic levels, and a secret weapon: it's entirely open-source, designed for you to play, tinker, and even contribute!</p>




<h2>
  
  
  🚀 The Story: From Retro Dreams to Modern Reality
</h2>

<p>Many of us have dreamed of remaking our favorite classics. For me, that dream was to revive an old <a href="https://github.com/cleder/yaac" rel="noopener noreferrer">Arkanoid-style game, "YaAC 🐧"</a>, using today's best game development tools. What started as a manual journey quickly evolved into something much more: a real game that's also a living showcase of modern game dev practices.</p>

<p>It’s built on a philosophy of "Kaizen no michi" (改善の道) – making small, continuous improvements. This means the game is always evolving, and every change is carefully considered.</p>




<h2>
  
  
  🕹️ Play It Now: Levels That Challenge, Physics That Impress
</h2>

<p>No downloads needed to get a taste of the action!</p>

<p><a href="https://cleder.github.io/brkrs/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Hit up the web version and start smashing bricks here</strong></a></p>

<p>Sorry at this time its only 2 levels (it is still early in the development process), but 70 more (lifted from YAAC) are coming soon, so stay tuned, or even better, help to make it come true ;-)</p>

<p><strong>brkrs</strong> extends the classic formula with some seriously cool features:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Classic Gameplay, Modern Feel:</strong> Paddle, ball, and bricks, but with a polished, satisfying punch.</li>
<li>
<strong>Rich Physics (Rapier3D):</strong> Experience accurate and engaging ball physics that make every bounce feel real.</li>
<li>
<strong>Dynamic Levels:</strong> Human-readable and easy-to-modify level configurations mean endless possibilities for custom stages.</li>
<li>
<strong>Paddle Rotation:</strong> Add a new layer of skill and strategy to your shots.</li>
<li>
<strong>Cross-Platform Fun:</strong> Play it on your desktop or directly in your browser thanks to WebAssembly!</li>
</ul>




<h2>
  
  
  🛠️ Go Deeper: A Game for Builders, Too
</h2>

<p>For those who love to dive into the mechanics of their favourite games, <strong>brkrs</strong> is a treasure trove. It's not just playable; it's also a fantastic example of a well-structured <strong><a href="https://rust-lang.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rust</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://bevy.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bevy</a></strong> project.</p>

<p><strong>Want to try building it yourself?</strong> You'll need Rust, Cargo, and Git.<br />
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight shell"><code>git clone https://github.com/cleder/brkrs.git
<span class="nb">cd </span>brkrs
cargo run <span class="nt">--release</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p><strong>Controls:</strong> Move the paddle with your mouse, use the scroll wheel to rotate (if enabled), and hit ESC to pause.</p>

<p>This is your chance to not just play, but to truly <strong>tinker</strong>. Ever wanted to add a new power-up? Change how a brick explodes? Or even design your own crazy levels? <strong>brkrs</strong> makes it approachable.</p>




<h2>
  
  
  🧠 Behind the Scenes: Spec-Driven Awesomeness
</h2>

<p>The game's development isn't just chaotic coding; it's built on <strong>spec-driven development (SDD)</strong>. This means every feature starts with a clear, detailed plan, much like a game designer's blueprint. We even use <strong><a href="https://github.com/github/spec-kit?tab=readme-ov-file#-spec-kit" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub's spec-kit</a></strong> to formalize these plans. It's a structured way to ensure every piece of the game works exactly as intended, minimizing bugs and maximizing fun.</p>

<p>And here's the kicker: this clear, step-by-step approach makes <strong>brkrs</strong> a perfect playground for experimenting with <strong>AI-assisted coding</strong>. Imagine using AI to help design a new brick type or tweak game logic – the structured specs make it surprisingly effective!</p>




<h2>
  
  
  📣 Help Wanted: Your Skills Can Level Up <strong>brkrs</strong>!

<p><strong>Check out the full repository here:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/cleder/brkrs?tab=readme-ov-file#readme" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>github.com/cleder/brkrs</strong></a></p>

<p>As Linus Torvalds famously said: <strong>“Talk is cheap. Show me the code.”</strong> We say: <strong>"Show me the game, the spec, and the code all at once!"</strong></p>




<h2>
  
  
  💡 The Philosophy: Spec-First, Incremental, and AI-Ready
</h2>

<p>Game development, especially in a framework like <strong>Bevy</strong>, can be a steep climb. The brkrs project was born from the desire to take an old idea <a href="https://github.com/cleder/yaac" rel="noopener noreferrer">(an Arkanoid clone)</a> and build it the modern way—a way that accelerates learning and embraces new tooling.</p>

<p>We follow a simple, yet powerful, development loop:</p>

<ol>
<li> <strong>Spec-First:</strong> Every single feature, no matter how small, begins as a clear specification using GitHub's <strong>speckit</strong>.</li>
<li> <strong>Incremental PRs:</strong> The spec flows through a small, focused issue or Pull Request. This embodies the "<strong>Kaizen no michi</strong>" (改善の道) philosophy of small, positive, daily changes.</li>
<li> <strong>Code &amp; Play:</strong> The result is working <strong>Rust</strong> code you can immediately see in the game.</li>
</ol>

<p>This structured approach makes <strong>brkrs</strong> the perfect sandbox for the AI coding community:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Agentic Testing:</strong> Need a small, contained task for your coding agent? Point it at a spec and a pending issue.</li>
<li>
<strong>AI-Assisted Feature Dev:</strong> Want to see how your favorite LLM handles adding a new brick behavior or adjusting physics? The clear specs provide the perfect prompt.</li>
<li>
<strong>Workflow Learning:</strong> Every merged PR is a clean, documented example of how a real-world feature is implemented in <strong>Rust</strong>/Bevy.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
  
  
  What is Spec-Driven Development?
</h3>

<p>The core of our workflow is the use of <strong><a href="https://github.com/github/spec-kit?tab=readme-ov-file#-spec-kit" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub's spec-kit</a></strong>. This is a framework for <strong>spec-driven development (SDD)</strong>, an approach where detailed, human-readable specifications are written <em>before</em> any code. SDD serves as the single source of truth for the desired behavior of a feature. By providing clear inputs, outputs, and requirements upfront, it minimizes guesswork, aligns team expectations, and provides a perfect, structured input for any AI coding assistant or agent.</p>

</blockquote>

<h2>
  
  
  🤝 Your Learning Path and Contribution
</h2>

<p>The goal is to make learning modern <strong>Rust</strong>/Bevy development as enjoyable as playing the game.</p>

<p>Here’s how you can engage:</p>

<ol>
<li> <strong>Read a Spec:</strong> Check out the repo or wiki for a feature you'd like to see.</li>
<li> <strong>Pick an Issue:</strong> Find a small, contained task that aligns with a spec.</li>
<li> <strong>Experiment with AI:</strong> Use your favourite AI tool (e.g., GitHub Copilot, a local agent) to help draft the code for the task.</li>
<li> <strong>Submit a PR:</strong> Show the community how you turned a spec into working <strong>Rust</strong> code!</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>brkrs</strong> is more than just a Breakout clone—it’s a living textbook for best practices in modern, spec-driven, and AI-augmented software development.</p>

<p>لقد كنت في هذا الموقف مراراً. في بداياتي، كنت أعتقد أن التعليم “المعتمد” حكر على من يملكون المال. كنت أرى شهادات زملائي على LinkedIn وأتساءل: “هل دفعوا حقاً كل هذه المبالغ؟”.</p>

<p>الإجابة التي قد تفاجئك هي: <strong>لا</strong>.</p>

<p>اكتشفت لاحقاً أن هناك “أبواباً خلفية” شرعية تماماً تضعها منصات مثل <strong>Coursera</strong> و <strong>Udemy</strong> لدعم المتعلمين، لكنها لا تعلن عنها بشكل واضح في الصفحة الرئيسية. اليوم، سأشاركك هذه الأسرار بصفتي خضت التجربة بنفسي. هذا ليس مجرد مقال نظري، بل هو خارطة طريق ستوفر عليك مئات الدولارات وتمنح سيرتك الذاتية (CV) الثقل الذي تستحقه.</p>

<p>تعتبر كورسيرا “الوحش الأكاديمي” في عالم التعليم أونلاين، حيث تقدم محتوى من جامعات عالمية (مثل ستانفورد، ميتشيغان، ولندن). المشكلة أن الكثيرين يختارون خيار “المستمع” (Audit) للدراسة مجاناً، ثم يصدمون في النهاية بأنهم <strong>لن يحصلوا على شهادة</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="الحل-السري-المساعدة-المالية-financial-aid">الحل السري: المساعدة المالية (Financial Aid)</h3>

<p>أغلب الدورات، حتى تلك التابعة لدرجات الماجستير المصغرة، تحتوي على رابط صغير جداً ومخفي بعناية يسمى “Financial aid available”. إليك الخطوات بدقة لضمان قبول طلبك:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>لا تضغط على زر “Enroll For Free”:</strong> هذا الزر سيقودك غالباً لفترة تجريبية مدفوعة لاحقاً. بدلاً من ذلك، ابحث عن رابط صغير بجوار العنوان الرئيسي للدورة مكتوب عليه “Financial aid available”.</li>
  <li><strong>املأ الطلب بذكاء:</strong> سيطلب منك الموقع كتابة إجابات قصيرة (حوالي 150 كلمة).
    <ul>
      <li><strong>لماذا تطلب الدعم؟</strong> كن صادقاً وواقعياً. تحدث عن وضعك كطالب، أو اختلاف سعر العملة في بلدك، وأن المبلغ المطلوب يعادل راتب شهر كامل في منطقتك. هذه الحقائق تقنعهم جداً.</li>
      <li><strong>كيف ستساعدك الدورة؟</strong> ابتعد عن العموميات. قل بوضوح: “هذه الشهادة في (تحليل البيانات) ستؤهلني للتقديم على وظيفة (محلل مبتدئ) التي أطمح لها، حيث تشترط الشركات لدينا وجود شهادة معتمدة”.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>انتظر 15 يوماً:</strong> نعم، الأمر يتطلب صبراً، لكن نسبة القبول تتجاوز 90% إذا كانت إجاباتك حقيقية وغير منسوخة من الإنترنت.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>نصيحة خبير:</strong> إذا كنت متحمساً ولا تطيق الانتظار، يمكنك البدء في الدراسة بنظام “Audit” فور تقديم الطلب. وعندما تأتيك الموافقة بعد أسبوعين، سيتم تحويل حسابك تلقائياً للنسخة المدفوعة وستحصل على الشهادة عند الإكمال.</p>

<p>إذا كنت مبتدئاً وتريد شيئاً قوياً تضعه في بداية سيرتك الذاتية، فلا شيء يتفوق على شهادات جوجل، خاصة في العالم العربي، فهي تعطي انطباعاً بالجدية والاحترافية.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>منصة “مهارات من Google”:</strong> تقدم دورة شهيرة جداً بعنوان <strong>“أساسيات التسويق الرقمي”</strong>. هذه الدورة ليست مجرد فيديوهات عابرة، بل منهج كامل معتمد من “Interactive Advertising Bureau”. والأجمل؟ أنها باللغة العربية بالكامل ومجانية 100%.</li>
  <li><strong>شهادات جوجل الاحترافية (Career Certificates):</strong> في مجالات مثل (IT Support, Data Analytics, UX Design). هذه الدورات مدفوعة عادة على كورسيرا، ولكن جوجل تقدم آلاف المنح سنوياً عبر شركاء محليين في مصر والسعودية والمغرب والإمارات. ابحث في جوجل عن “منحة جوجل + اسم بلدك” وستجد المؤسسات التي توزع هذه المنح (مثل وزارة الاتصالات أو منظمات الشباب).</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="4-لينكد-إن-linkedin-learning-اللمسة-الاحترافية">4. لينكد إن (LinkedIn Learning): اللمسة الاحترافية</h2>

<p>شهادات هذه المنصة تظهر بشكل أنيق جداً في ملفك الشخصي وتلفت انتباه مسؤولي التوظيف (Recruiters) لأنها تثبت أنك نشط وتطور نفسك باستمرار.</p>

<p><strong>الحيلة البسيطة (The Trial Hack):</strong>
المنصة تمنح شهراً مجانياً واحداً (Free Month) للمستخدمين الجدد.</p>
<ol>
  <li>سجل للاشتراك المجاني (يتطلب إدخال بطاقة، لكن لن يتم الخصم).</li>
  <li>حدد 3 مهارات تريد تعلمها بتركيز (مثلاً: التفاوض، الإكسل المتقدم، القيادة).</li>
  <li>أنهِ الدورات واحصل على الشهادات واحفظها (Download PDF).</li>
  <li><strong>مهم جداً:</strong> قم بإلغاء الاشتراك قبل نهاية الشهر بيوم واحد. ستحتفظ بالشهادات التي حصلت عليها ولن تدفع شيئاً.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="خارطة-الطريق-ماذا-تفعل-الآن">خارطة الطريق: ماذا تفعل الآن؟</h2>

<p>يا صديقي، تجميع الشهادات ليس هواية، والشهادة هي “وسيلة” وليست “غاية”.
نصيحتي لك من واقع خبرة عملية لكي تستفيد فعلاً:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>حدد هدفاً واحداً:</strong> لا تشتت نفسك. هل تريد تعلم البرمجة؟ اذهب لقائمة الكوبونات في الموقع الذي ذكرته لك بالأعلى. هل تريد التسويق؟ ابدأ بمهارات من جوجل.</li>
  <li><strong>التزم:</strong> الحصول على الدورة مجاناً قد يجعلك تتكاسل عن إكمالها لأنك “لم تدفع شيئاً”. عاملها وكأنك دفعت فيها 100 دولار من جيبك الخاص.</li>
  <li><strong>شارك هذا الخير:</strong> هناك الآلاف من الطلاب العرب يبحثون عن هذه الفرص وتائهون في دوامة المحتوى المدفوع. مشاركتك لهذا الدليل قد تكون سبباً في حصول شخص على وظيفة وتغيير حياته.</li>
</ol>

<p>العلم متاح للجميع الآن، والكرة في ملعبك. ابدأ اليوم، ولا تدع عائق المال يوقفك بعد الآن.</p>

            <p>I have just released version 0.9.11 of Shed Skin, a restricted-Python-to-C++ compiler. Most importantly, it adds support for Python 3.14. It also adds support for many 3.x features that were not yet implemented, in addition to basic support for the base64 module. It also optimizes a few more common code patterns.

<p>Paul Boddie was able to add support for libpcre2, and in the process updated conan to version 2. Thanks to Shakeeb and now Paul, Shed Skin has had first-class Windows support for the last few releases.

<p>A new release is often triggered by a nice new example. In this case I found an advanced/educational 3d renderer by Benny Bobaganoosh, and rewrote it from Java to Python. In ~500 lines of code, it renders an .obj file with perspective-correct texture mapping and so on, clipping, lighting.. It becomes about 13 times faster after compilation (in other words, it goes from about 2 to about 30 FPS).

<div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhRFEPZpQURqkukT2_2xLVsc_sK2hVqy_BmJdA4EOpzSfhM_iMoGqC8kLkjRyo69FGqGrUbHcYuzvD-N0Q-JA4iNtfxRUbrASb9m6IHoDjsXYl2pz7cJWeHeOovZa6BiCt1BYpuC-2swmNo3yY8mXUOV-oeaVgqiW3S5eK4PcF8h67zap4v6xdaGfCklMiN/s557/h1.png" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center;"><img alt="" border="0" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhRFEPZpQURqkukT2_2xLVsc_sK2hVqy_BmJdA4EOpzSfhM_iMoGqC8kLkjRyo69FGqGrUbHcYuzvD-N0Q-JA4iNtfxRUbrASb9m6IHoDjsXYl2pz7cJWeHeOovZa6BiCt1BYpuC-2swmNo3yY8mXUOV-oeaVgqiW3S5eK4PcF8h67zap4v6xdaGfCklMiN/s320/h1.png" /></a></div>

<p>For the full list of changes in the release, please see the <a href="https://github.com/shedskin/shedskin/releases/tag/v0.9.11">release notes</a>.

<p>Something I have noticed while working on this release is that small object allocations seem to have become faster under Linux, to the degree that programs that would become _slower_ after compilation because of excessive small-object allocation, are now usually _faster_ again, at least on my system. This motivated me to measure the speedup for all 84 example programs at the moment versus cpython 3.13. While it's still all over the place, I was happy to see a median speedup of 12 times, and an average of 20 times.

<p>I would very much appreciate more feedback on/assistance with the project. There is always enough low-hanging fruit to help with! See for example the current list of issues for 0.9.12. But just testing random things, finding interesting new example programs, cleaning up parts of the code and such are also much appreciated.

            A lot of people building software today never took the traditional CS path. They arrived through curiosity, a job that needed automating, or a late-night itch to make something work. This week, David Kopec joins me to talk about rebuilding computer science for exactly those folks, the ones who learned to program first and are now ready to understand the deeper ideas that power the tools they use every day.

  brkrs — a fun, playable brick-breaker game &amp; learning playground
</h1>

<p><strong>brkrs</strong> is a real, playable Breakout/Arkanoid-style game written in <a href="https://rust-lang.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Rust</strong> 🦀</a> using the <a href="https://bevy.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Bevy</strong></a> engine.<br />
It’s also a <strong>hands-on learning project</strong>, letting you explore:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Spec-first development</strong> with GitHub <strong>speckit</strong>
</li>
<li>Incremental feature development through issues &amp; PRs</li>
<li>AI-assisted and agentic coding experiments</li>
</ul>

<p>Every feature starts as a spec, flows through an issue or PR, and ends as working Rust code. You can <strong>play the game, explore the code, and learn modern Rust/Bevy workflows all at the same time</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Linus Torvalds said: <strong>“Talk is cheap. Show me the code.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>brkrs lets you play, tinker, and see the specs come alive in a real game.</p>


<h2>
  
  
  The Story Behind brkrs
</h2>

<p>I always wanted to <strong>rewrite my old <a href="https://github.com/cleder/yaac" rel="noopener noreferrer">Arkanoid/Breakout-style game, YaAC 🐧</a></strong>, in a modern game framework.</p>

<p>I began by <strong>manually implementing the core gameplay foundations</strong>: reading documentation, following examples, and building a basic proof-of-concept with the essential mechanics (ball, paddle, bricks).</p>

<p>It quickly became clear that doing everything manually would involve <strong>a steep learning curve and a lot of time</strong>.</p>

<p>brkrs was born as a solution: a way to <strong>learn modern Rust game development</strong>, apply <strong>spec-first workflows</strong>, and experiment with <strong>AI-assisted coding</strong>, all while still having fun playing a real game.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Key Features
</h2>

<p><code>brkrs</code> is a Breakout/Arkanoid style game implemented in Rust with the Bevy engine. It extends the classic formula with richer physics, paddle rotation, and per-level configuration.</p>

<ul>
<li>Classic Breakout-style gameplay: paddle, ball, bricks, and levels</li>
<li>Levels are human-readable and easy to modify</li>
<li>Spec-first workflow: every feature begins as a spec and ends as working Rust code</li>
<li>Small, incremental PRs demonstrate the development workflow and learning path</li>
<li>Crate-ready and cross-platform (desktop + WebAssembly builds)</li>
<li>A <strong>fun, approachable way to learn Rust, Bevy, and modern coding practices</strong>
</li>
</ul>

    <h2>Improving readability with text wrapping</h2>
    
      
        <p>Sometimes programmers like to <em>manually</em> wrap their text to a specific maximum line length.</p>

      
        <p>This is unwrapped free-flowing text (made with a <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/multi-line-strings/" target="_blank">multiline string</a>):</p>

<span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">license</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>When we print this text at the terminal, it will something like this:</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>$ python3 license.py

        <p>Let's manually wrap this text to a 78-character line length:</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">license</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"""</span>

</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>When we print this text, we'll now see that it's a bit easier to read in our terminal:</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>$ python3 license.py

            <p>We are thrilled to announce that the <a href="https://www.sovereign.tech/">Sovereign Tech Agency</a> has <a href="https://www.sovereign.tech/tech/python-software-foundation">committed to a €86,000 investment</a> in work to be performed by the Python Software Foundation to improve the security of CPython and the Python Package Index (PyPI). The Sovereign Tech Agency is a public organization in Germany that focuses on increasing the security and resilience of critical open source software that forms the foundation of modern digital technology.</p><div><div>With the Sovereign Tech Fund, they invest globally in open software components that underpin economic competitiveness and the ability to innovate. Improving the security, stability, and reusability of open software components like CPython and PyPI is a win for everyone. This&nbsp; project consists of two components, which we are carrying out in parallel: one focused on CPython and one focused on PyPI.&nbsp;</div></div><div><br /></div><div><div>The CPython component, led by <a href="https://sethmlarson.dev/">PSF Security Developer in Residence Seth Larson</a>, concerns archive-handling vulnerabilities in CPython’s standard library. Following multiple CVEs affecting the tarfile and zipfile modules, systematic fuzz-testing is required to uncover potential regressions or untested cases in extraction filtering. These modules are used by most Python packaging and installation tools, and therefore form a critical part of the software supply chain. The work commissioned through the Sovereign Tech Fund’s investment will develop test cases and seed corpora for these modules, integrate fuzz-testing through the OSS-Fuzz infrastructure, and validate filtering protections against potential bypasses.</div></div><div><br /></div><div><div>The PyPI component, led by <a href="https://www.miketheman.net/">PSF PyPI Safety and Security Engineer Mike Fiedler</a> with support from Director of Infrastructure Ee Durbin, focuses on PyPI account integrity and recovery. Current recovery procedures rely solely on email and two-factor authentication, creating support burdens and limiting automated verification. The Sovereign Tech Fund’s investment commissions work that introduces a mechanism for associating PyPI accounts with verified third-party identities through OAuth 2.0 / OIDC flows, allowing account recovery through trusted external services. These associations will improve both user experience and platform reliability while preserving user privacy and autonomy.</div></div><div><br /></div><div><div>We appreciate the Sovereign Tech Fund for supporting these critical improvements that will make CPython and PyPI more secure for millions of users. If you’d like to learn more about the advances our Developers in Residence are driving or investing in these roles and work, check out our <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/developersinresidence/">Developers in Residence page</a> and reach out out to sponsors@python.org</div></div><div><br /></div>

            <p>In our <a href="https://www.caktusgroup.com/blog/2025/10/28/learning-llm-basics-ollama/">previous post</a>, we explored how to send text to an LLM and receive a text response in return. That is useful for chatbots, but often we need to integrate LLMs with other systems. We may want the model to query a database, call an external API, or perform calculations.</p>
