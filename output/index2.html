            For years, building interactive widgets in Python notebooks meant wrestling with toolchains, platform quirks, and a mountain of JavaScript machinery. Most developers took one look and backed away slowly. Trevor Manz decided that barrier did not need to exist. His idea was simple: give Python users just enough JavaScript to unlock the web’s interactivity, without dragging along the rest of the web ecosystem. That idea became anywidget, and it is quickly becoming the quiet connective tissue of modern interactive computing. Today we dig into how it works, why it has taken off, and how it might change the way we explore data.

            >
          </h2>
          
        </div>

        <!-- Content Section -->
        <div class="p-4 flex-grow overflow-hidden">
          <p class="text-base-content">
            <p>I&#8217;ve been moving all my MCPs to skills, including the remaining one I still
used: the Sentry MCP<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>.  Previously I had already moved entirely away from
Playwright to a Playwright skill.</p>
<p>In the last month or so there have been discussions about using <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/advanced-tool-use">dynamic tool
loadouts</a> to defer
loading of tool definitions until later.  Anthropic has also been toying around
with the idea of wiring together MCP calls via code, something <a href="/2025/7/3/tools/">I have
experimented with</a>.</p>
<p>I want to share my updated findings with all of this and why the deferred tool
loading that Anthropic came up with does not fix my lack of love for MCP.  Maybe
they are useful for someone else.</p>
<h2>What is a Tool?</h2>
<p>When the agent encounters a tool definition through reinforcement learning or
otherwise, it is encouraged to emit tool calls through special tokens when it
encounters a situation where that tool call would be appropriate.  For all
intents and purposes, tool definitions can only appear between special tool
definition tokens in a system prompt.  Historically this means that you cannot
emit tool definitions later in the conversation state.  So your only real option
is for a tool to be loaded when the conversation starts.</p>
<p>In agentic uses, you can of course compress your conversation state or change
the tool definitions in the system message at any point.  But the consequence is
that you will lose the reasoning traces and also the cache.  In the case of
Anthropic, for instance, this will make your conversation significantly more
expensive.  You would basically start from scratch and pay full token rates plus
cache write cost, compared to cache read.</p>
<p>One recent innovation from Anthropic is deferred tool loading.  You still
declare tools ahead of time in the system message, but they are not injected
into the conversation when the initial system message is emitted.  Instead they
appear at a later point.  The tool definitions however still have to be static
for the entire conversation, as far as I know.  So the tools that could exist
are defined when the conversation starts.  The way Anthropic discovers the tools
is purely by regex search.</p>
<h2>Contrasting with Skills</h2>
<p>This is all quite relevant because even though MCP with deferred loading feels
like it should perform better, it actually requires quite a bit of engineering
on the LLM API side.  The skill system gets away without any of that and, at
least from my experience, still outperforms it.</p>
<p>Skills are really just short summaries of which skills exist and in which file
the agent can learn more about them.  These are proactively loaded into the
context.  So the agent understands in the system context (or maybe somewhere
later in the context) what capabilities it has and gets a link to the manual for
how to use them.</p>
<p>Crucially, skills do not actually load a tool definition into the context.  The
tools remain the same: bash and the other tools the agent already has.  All it
learns from the skill are tips and tricks for how to use these tools more
effectively.</p>
<p>Because the main thing it learns is how to use other command line tools and
similar utilities, the fundamentals of how to chain and coordinate them together
do not actually change.  The reinforcement learning that made the Claude family
of models very good tool callers just helps with these newly discovered tools.</p>
<h2>MCP as Skills?</h2>
<p>So that obviously raises the question: if skills work so well, can I move the
MCP outside of the context entirely and invoke it through the CLI in a similar
way as Anthropic proposes?  The answer is yes, you can, but it doesn&#8217;t work
well.  One option here is Peter Steinberger&#8217;s
<a href="https://github.com/steipete/mcporter">mcporter</a>.  In short, it reads the
<code>.mcp.json</code> files and exposes the MCPs behind it as callable tools:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>npx mcporter call 'linear.create_comment(issueId: &quot;ENG-123&quot;, body: &quot;Looks good!&quot;)'
</pre></div>
<p>And yes, it looks very much like a command line tool that the LLM can invoke.
The problem however is that the LLM does not have any idea about what tools are
available, and now you need to teach it that.  So you might think: why not make
some skills that teach the LLM about the MCPs?  Here the issue for me comes from
the fact that MCP servers have no desire to maintain API stability.  They are
increasingly starting to trim down tool definitions to the bare minimum to
preserve tokens.  This makes sense, but for the skill pattern it&#8217;s not what you
want.  For instance, the Sentry MCP server at one point switched the query
syntax entirely to natural language.  A great improvement for the agent, but my
suggestions for how to use it became a hindrance and I did not discover the
issue straight away.</p>
<p>This is in fact quite similar to Anthropic&#8217;s deferred tool loading: there is no
information about the tool in the context at all.  You <em>need</em> to create a
summary.  The eager loading of MCP tools we have done in the past now has ended
up with an awkward compromise: the description is both too long to eagerly load
it, and too short to really tell the agent how to use it.  So at least
from my experience, you end up maintaining these manual skill summaries for MCP
tools exposed via mcporter or similar.</p>
<h2>Path Of Least Resistance</h2>
<p>This leads me to my current conclusion: I tend to go with what is easiest, which
is to ask the agent to write its own tools as a skill.  Not only does it not
take all that long, but the biggest benefit is that the tool is largely under my
control.  Whenever it breaks or needs some other functionality, I ask the agent
to adjust it.  The Sentry MCP is a great example.  I think it&#8217;s probably one of
the better designed MCPs out there, but I don&#8217;t use it anymore.  In part because
when I load it into the context right away I lose around 8k tokens out of the
box, and I could not get it to work via mcporter.  On the other hand, I have
Claude maintain a skill for me.  And yes, that skill is probably quite buggy and
needs to be updated, but because the agent maintains it, it works out better.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s quite likely that all of this will change, but at the moment manually
maintained skills and agents writing their own tools have become my preferred
way.  I suspect that dynamic tool loading with MCP will become a thing, but it
will probably quite some protocol changes to bring in skill-like summaries and
built-in manuals for the tools.  I also suspect that MCP would greatly benefit
of protocol stability.  The fact that MCP servers keep changing their tool
descriptions at will does not work well with materialized calls and external
tool descriptions in READMEs and skill files.</p>

<li id="fn-1">
<p>Keen readers will remember that last time, the last MCP I used was
Playwright.  In the meantime I added and removed two more MCPs: Linear and
Sentry, mostly because of authentication issues and neither having a great
command line interface.<a class="footnote" href="#fnref-1">&#8617;</a></p></li>

            <p>The <a href="/foundation/teams/#code-of-conduct-team">Code of Conduct working group</a> received 4 reports and met 12 times in 2025. This transparency report is a brief account of how those reports were handled. This year’s number is lower than previous years in part because of the formation of the <a href="/foundation/teams/#online-community-team">Online Community Working Group</a> which handles moderation on our official spaces and has been able to act directly on smaller scale infractions. In some cases we received additional reporting while investigating initial reports, but have not counted those as separate instances.</p>
<p>This working group conducts business in several ways. It has online meetings, typically once per month. It also discusses issues in a Slack channel, but most cases are handled in the meetings.
The group welcomed three new members this year: Ariane Djeupang, Natalia Bidart, and Priya Pahwa. Natalia was selected by the new Online Communities Working Group as their liaison to the Code of Conduct Working group; Ariane and Priya were elected by the working group. The group also saw Jay Miller step down this year. We all want to thank Jay for his continued role in our community and for all the work he did with the Code of Conduct group.</p>
<p>It was the group’s intention to work with a consultant to update our Code of Conduct and processes. We reached out to two consultants to help with that work, but unfortunately we weren’t able to engage either to get that work completed. We hope to progress with that in 2026. In the meantime, we made a few internal process tweaks - creating up a new “ask CoC” channel with key stakeholders to discuss moderation and CoC enforcement, and having our team set up as moderators in GitHub until we find a better model.</p>
<p>Two reports from late 2024 carried into this year. Two reports resulted in suspensions from the relevant platforms. Another was shared with local event organizers.</p>
<hr />
<p>Finally, this section provides a brief summary of the kinds of cases that were handled:</p>
<ul>
<li>One case involved repeated violations of the Discourse rules about self promotion. The working group recommended a suspension from the forum.</li>
<li>One case involved repeated behavior across several platforms that discouraged participation and created problems for others. The working group recommended a suspension from all relevant platforms and working groups.</li>
<li>One case involved an incident at a PSF-sponsored event. The information was passed on to the local organizers.</li>
</ul>

            <p>Despite considering myself a “gamer”,
I realized I had only played <strong>~5 hours of video-games
in the whole year 2022</strong> and ~6 hours in 2021. Honestly, these numbers
made me a bit sad to see... You can't “improve” what you don't measure, so
I started looking for low-effort ways to measure the amount
of play time while getting back into <em>actually playing video-games</em>.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>I have already achieved what I wanted for GameCube by mid-2025 using
the <a href="https://www.8bitmods.wiki/memcard-pro-gc">Memcard Pro GC</a>’s Wi-Fi and API.
I’ve <a href="https://sethmlarson.dev/setting-discord-status-from-physical-gamecube-console">blogged about this setup</a>
which gathers date and duration data for playing GameCube,
but I wanted to cover my other consoles.</p>

<h2>What about the Nintendo Switch?</h2>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-8">
<p>Surprisingly, Nintendo Switch offered no such data,
despite having an option called “Play Activity” in the
menus of the Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Account, and
many of their mobile apps. This was unfortunate, as I
was playing many more new Nintendo Switch games like
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_Mario:_The_Thousand-Year_Door#Remake">Paper Mario: Thousand-Year Door</a> remake and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pikmin_4">Pikmin 4</a>,
and going back to games I had “missed” like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>.</p>

<p>That is... until the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/mobile-apps/nintendo-store/">Nintendo Store app</a>
was released just a few weeks ago. This app
provides “Play Activity” data at a <strong>much higher resolution</strong> than any other Nintendo app or service.
You can find complete historical data across your Nintendo Account, going back as far as
the <em>Nintendo 3DS and Wii-U!</em> The data includes games played, dates, and play durations in 15 minute increments.</p>

<p>Shoutout to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@WulffDen">WULFF DEN podcast</a>
for talking about this, otherwise I would never have discovered this niché new feature.
But how can I query this data for my own purposes?</p>

</div>

<br /><small><i>Example of data available in the Nintendo Store “Play Activity”.</i></small>
</center>
</div>
</div>

<h2>Using Optical Character Recognition (OCR)</h2>

<p>Basically the data was in the app, but couldn't be selected
and copy-pasted or exported. Instead, the data would have to be transferred
to a queryable format another way.</p>

<p>I took this as an opportunity to try out a technology I'd
never used before: Optical Character Recognition (OCR).
OCR basically turns pictures of letters and numbers into
actual strings of text. State of the art for OCR today
appears to be using machine-learning models.</p>

<p>After a bit of research, I landed on <a href="https://pypi.org/project/easyocr">EasyOCR</a> which uses
PyTorch models that are already pre-trained. This appeared
to require downloading the model from the internet, which
bothered me a bit, but I decided that running the model
within a Docker container without network access (<code>--net=none</code>)
was <em>probably</em> enough to guarantee this library wasn't
sending my data off my machine.</p>

<p>I created a workflow (<a href="https://github.com/sethmlarson/nintendo-play-activity-ocr/">source code available on GitHub</a>) that takes a directory of images mounted
as a volume, runs OCR on each image, and then returns the parsed
text as “JSON lines” for each image along with the checksum of
the image. This checksum is stored by the program processing the
OCR text to avoid running OCR on images more than once.</p>

<p>This is an example of the text that OCR is able to read from
one screenshot:</p>

<div class="codehilite">
<pre><span></span><code><span class="p">[</span>
  <span class="s2">&quot;20:13&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;15&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="s2">&quot;Play Activity&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="s2">&quot;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="s2">&quot;5/9/2020&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>  <span class="s2">&quot;1 hr; 15 min.&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="s2">&quot;5/8/2020&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>  <span class="s2">&quot;1 hr. 0 min:&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="s2">&quot;5/5/2020&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>  <span class="s2">&quot;45 min:&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="s2">&quot;5/4/2020&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>  <span class="s2">&quot;1 hr. 30 min:&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="s2">&quot;5/3/2020&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>  <span class="s2">&quot;A few min.&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="o">...</span>
<span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>There's some unexpected elements here!
Notice how the phone time and battery are picked up by OCR
and how the play time durations all have either <code>.</code> or <code>:</code> at the end.
This extra punctuation seems to come from the vertical border
on the screen to the right of the text. The least consistent
readings are when there is text as a part of the game logo.</p>

<h2>Segmenting and parsing OCR data</h2>

<p>OCR can consistently the actual text
from the application itself, so we can use the <code>Play Activity</code>
and <code>First played</code> labels as anchors to know where the other
data is. Using these anchors we can segment OCR text into:</p>

<ul>
<li>Phone UI (time, battery %)</li>
<li>Game information (title, first played, last played)</li>
<li>Game play activity (date, duration)</li>
</ul>

<p>For some games the model really struggles to read the game title
consistently. To fix this I created a list of words that the OCR
model <em>does</em> consistently read and mapped those words to corresponding
game titles, such as “<code>Wonder</code>” → “<code>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</code>”.
This would be a problem if I played more games, but we’ll cross
that bridge when we come to it! ;)</p>

<p>The game play activity data parses fairly consistently. The date is always
<code>MM/DD/YYYY</code> and there are three forms
of duration that the application uses:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>A few min</code></li>
<li><code>XX min</code></li>
<li><code>X hr Y min</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Parsing the date and duration text and accounting for the extra punctuation was accomplished
with a single regular expression:</p>

<pre><code>([1-9][0-9]?/[1-9][0-9]?/2[0-9]{3})
(A few min|(?:([0-9]+)\s*hr[:;,. ]+)?([0-9]+)\s*min)
</code></pre>

<p>This parses out into 4 groups, the date, a “flag” for detecting “A few min”,
and then hours and minutes. Because the resolution below 15 minutes isn't shown
by the application I assigned the “A few min” duration an approximate value of 5 minutes of play time.
The explicit hours and minutes values are calculated as expected.</p>

<p>So now we have the game name and a list of play activity days and durations
from a single image, do that to each image and insert the results into an SQLite database
that you can query:</p>

<div class="codehilite">
<pre><span></span><code><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="n">STRFTIME</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'%Y'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nb">date</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">AS</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="k">SUM</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">duration</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="mi">3600</span> <span class="k">AS</span> <span class="n">d</span>
<span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">sessions</span> <span class="k">GROUP</span> <span class="k">BY</span> <span class="n">y</span> <span class="k">ORDER</span> <span class="k">BY</span> <span class="n">y</span> <span class="k">ASC</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The results show just how little I was playing video
games in 2021 and 2022 and how I started playing more
again in 2023 onwards.</p>

  <th>Year</th>

<p>Whenever I want fresh data I can take new screenshots of
the Nintendo Store app on my phone,
place the new screenshots in the <code>images/</code> folder,
and run the <code>index.py</code> script to only run OCR on the new images.</p>

<p>If this blog post was interesting to you, I'm planning to look at this data combined with my 
<a href="https://sethmlarson.dev/setting-discord-status-from-physical-gamecube-console">GameCube play activity data</a>
before the end of 2025. <em>Stay tuned and play more games!</em></p>

            <p>The Online Community Working Group has introduced a new GitHub repository designed to manage and track ideas, suggestions, and improvements across Django's various online community platforms.</p>
<h4 id="s-introducing-the-online-community-working-group-repository">Introducing the Online Community Working Group Repository</h4>
<p>Primarily inspired by the rollout of the <a href="https://github.com/django/new-features">New Features</a> repository, the Online Community Working Group has launched <a href="https://github.com/django/online-community-working-group">their own version</a> that works in conjunction with the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/django/projects/26">Online Community Working Group Ideas GitHub project</a> to provide a mechanism to gather feedback, suggestions, and ideas from across the online community and track their progression.</p>
<p>The primary aim is to help better align Django's presence across multiple online platforms by providing:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Centralisation</strong>: A community-platform-agnostic place to collect feedback, suggestions, and ideas from members of any of Django's online communities.</li>
<li><strong>Visibility</strong>: With a variety of platforms in use across the community, some of which require an account before their content can even be read, discussions can happen in what effectively amount to private silos. This centralised repository allows all suggestions and ideas to be viewed by everybody, regardless of their community platform of choice.</li>
<li><strong>Consistency</strong>: A suggestion for one platform can often be a good idea for another. Issues and ideas raised centrally can be assessed against all platforms to better align Django's online community experience.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="s-how-to-use-the-online-community-working-group-repo">How to use the Online Community Working Group Repo</h4>
<p>If you have an idea or a suggestion for any of Django's online community platforms (such as the <a href="https://forum.djangoproject.com/">Forum</a>, <a href="https://chat.djangoproject.com/">Discord</a>, or elsewhere), the process starts by <a href="https://github.com/django/online-community-working-group/issues">creating an issue</a> in the new repository.</p>
<p>You'll be asked to summarise the idea, and answer a couple of short questions regarding which platform it applies to and the rationale behind your idea.</p>
<p>The suggestion will be visible on the public board, and people will be able to react to the idea with emoji responses as a quick measure of support, or provide longer-form answers as comments on the issue.</p>
<p>The Online Community Working Group will review, triage, and respond to all suggestions, before deciding whether or how they can be implemented across the community.</p>
<h4 id="s-existing-online-communities">Existing Online Communities</h4>
<p>Note that we're not asking that you stop using any mechanisms in place within the particular community you're a part of currently—the Discord <a href="https://discord.com/channels/856567261900832808/1092722048561840170">#suggestions</a> channel is not going away, for example. However, we may ask that a suggestion or idea flagged within a particular platform be raised via this new GitHub repo instead, in order increase its visibility, apply it to multiple communities, or simply better track its resolution.</p>
<h4 id="s-conclusion">Conclusion</h4>
<p>The Online Community Working Group was relatively recently set up, with the aim of improving the experience for members of all Django's communities online. This new repository takes a first step in that direction. Check out the repository at <a href="https://github.com/django/online-community-working-group">django/online-community-working-group</a> on GitHub to learn more and start helping shape Django's truly excellent community presence online.</p>

            <p>Elon Musk <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/elon-musk-threatens-response-against-individuals-who-imposed-e120m-x-penalty/">is not
happy</a>
with the EU fining his X platform and is currently on a tweet rampage
complaining about it.  Among other things, he wants the whole EU to be
abolished.  He sadly is hardly the first wealthy American to share their
opinions on European politics lately.  I&#8217;m not a fan of this outside attention
but I believe it&#8217;s noteworthy and something to pay attention to.  In particular
because the idea of destroying and ripping apart the EU is not just popular in
the US; it&#8217;s popular over here too.  Something that greatly concerns me.</p>
<h2>We Have Genuine Problems</h2>
<p>There is definitely a bunch of stuff we might want to fix over here.  <a href="/2025/10/21/eu-resigation/">I have
complained about our culture</a> before. Unfortunately,
I happen to think that our challenges are not coming from politicians or civil
servants, but from us, the people.  Europeans don&#8217;t like to take risks and are
quite pessimistic about the future compared to their US counterparts.
Additionally, we Europeans have been trained to feel a lot of guilt over the
years, which makes us hesitant to stand up for ourselves.  This has led to all
kinds of interesting counter-cultural movements in Europe, like years of
significant support for unregulated immigration and an unhealthy obsession with
the idea of degrowth.  Today, though, neither seems quite as popular as it once
was.</p>
<p>Morally these things may be defensible, but in practice they have led to Europe
losing its competitive edge and eroding social cohesion.  The combination of a
strong social state and high taxes in particular does not mix well with the kind
of immigration we have seen in the last decade: mostly people escaping wars
ending up in low-skilled jobs.  That means it&#8217;s not unlikely that certain
classes of immigrants are going to be net-negative for a very long time, if not
forever, and increasingly society is starting to think about what the
implications of that might be.</p>
<p>Yet even all of that is not where our problems lie, and it&#8217;s certainly not our
presumed lack of free speech.  Any conversation on that topic is foolish because
it&#8217;s too nuanced.  Society clearly wants to place some limits to free speech
here, but the same is true in the US.  In the US we can currently see a
significant push-back against &#8220;woke ideologies,&#8221; and a lot of that push-back
involves restricting freedom of expression through different avenues.</p>
<h2>America Likes a Weak Europe</h2>
<p>The US might try to lecture Europe right now on free speech, but what it should
be lecturing us on is our economic model.  Europe has too much fragmentation,
incredibly strict regulation that harms innovation, ineffective capital markets,
and a massive dependency on both the United States and China.  If the US were to
cut us off from their cloud providers, we would not be able to operate anything
over here.  If China were to stop shipping us chips, we would be in deep trouble
too (<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/28/nexperia-crisis-dutch-chipmaker-issues-urgent-plea-to-its-china-unit.html">we have seen
this</a>).</p>
<p>This is painful because the US is historically a great example when it comes to
freedom of information, direct democracy at the state level, and rather low
corruption.  These are all areas where we&#8217;re not faring well, at least not
consistently, and we should be lectured.  Fundamentally, the US approach to
capitalism is about as good as it&#8217;s going to get.  If there was any doubt that
alternative approaches might have worked out better, at this point there&#8217;s very
little evidence in favor of that.  Yet because of increased loss of civil
liberties in the US, many Europeans now see everything that the US is doing as
bad.  A grave mistake.</p>
<p>Both China and the US are quite happy with the dependency we have on them and
with us falling short of our potential.  Europe&#8217;s attempt at dealing with the
dependency so far has been to regulate and tax US corporations more heavily.
That&#8217;s not a good strategy.  The solution must be to become competitive again so
that we can redirect that tax revenue to local companies instead.  The Digital
Services Act is a good example: we&#8217;re punishing Apple and forcing them to open
up their platform, but we have no company that can take advantage of that
opening.</p>
<h2>Europe is Europe&#8217;s Biggest Problem</h2>
<p>If you read my blog here, you might remember my musings about <a href="/2025/9/14/whats-an-foreigner/">the lack of
clarity of what a foreigner is</a> in Europe.  The
reality is that Europe has been deeply integrated for a long time now as a
result of how the EU works — but still not at the same level as the US.  I think
this is still the biggest problem.  People point to languages as the challenge,
but underneath the hood, the countries are still fighting each other.  Austria
wants to protect its local stores from larger competition in Germany and its
carpenters from the cheaper ones coming from Slovenia.  You can replace Austria
with any other EU country and you will find the same thing.</p>
<p>The EU might not be perfect, but it&#8217;s hard to imagine that abolishing it would
solve any problem given how national states have shown to behave.  The moment
the EU fell away, we would be warming up all border struggles again.  We have
already seen similar issues pop up in Northern Ireland after the UK left.</p>
<p>And we just have so much bureaucracy, so many non-functioning social systems,
and such a tremendous amount of incoming governmental debt to support our
flailing pension schemes.  We need growth more than any other bloc, and we have
such a low probability of actually accomplishing that.</p>
<p>Given how the EU is structured, it&#8217;s also acting as the punching bag for the
failure of the nation states to come to agreements.  It&#8217;s not that EU
bureaucrats are telling Europeans to take in immigrants, to enact chat control
or to enact cookie banners or attached plastic caps.  Those are all initiatives
that come from one or more member states.  But the EU in the end will always
take the blame because even local politicians that voted in support of some of
these things can easily point towards &#8220;Brussels&#8221; as having created a problem.</p>
<h2>The United States of Europe</h2>
<p>A Europe in pieces does not sound appealing to me at all, and that&#8217;s because I
can look at what China and the US have.</p>
<p>What China and the US have that Europe lacks is a strong national identity. Both
countries have recognized that strength comes from unity.  China in particular
is fighting any kind of regionalism tooth and nail.  The US has accomplished
this through the pledge of allegiance, a civil war, the Department of Education
pushing a common narrative in schools, and historically putting post offices and
infrastructure everywhere.  Europe has none of that. More importantly, Europeans
don&#8217;t even want it.  There is a mistaken belief that we can just become these
tiny states again and be fine.</p>
<p>If Europe wants to be competitive, it seems unlikely that this can be
accomplished without becoming a unified superpower.  Yet there is no belief in
Europe that this can or should happen, and the other superpowers have little
interest in seeing it happen either.</p>
<h2>What Would Fixing Actually Look Like?</h2>
<p>If I had to propose something constructive, it would be this: Europe needs to
stop pretending it can be 27 different countries with 27 different economic
policies while also being a single market.  The half-measures are killing us. We
have a common currency in the Eurozone but no common fiscal policy.  We have
freedom of movement but wildly different social systems.  We have common
regulations but fragmented enforcement.  27 labor laws, 27 different legal
systems, tax codes, complex VAT rules and so on.</p>
<p><a href="https://commission.europa.eu/topics/competitiveness/draghi-report_en">The Draghi
report</a>
from last year laid out many of these issues quite clearly: Europe needs massive
investment in technology and infrastructure.  It needs a genuine single market
for services, not just goods.  It needs capital markets that can actually fund
startups at scale.  None of this is news to anyone paying attention.</p>
<p>But here&#8217;s the uncomfortable truth: none of this will happen without Europeans
accepting that more integration is the answer, not less.  And right now, the
political momentum is in the opposite direction.  Every country wants the
benefits of the EU without the obligations.  Every country wants to protect its
own industries while accessing everyone else&#8217;s markets.</p>
<p>One of the arguments against deeper integration is that Europe hinges on some
quite unrelated issues.  For instance, the EU is seen as non-democratic, but
some of the criticism just does not sit right with me.  Sure, I too would
welcome more democracy in the EU, but at the same time, the system really is
not undemocratic today.  Take things like chat control: the reason this thing
does not die, is because some member states and their elected representatives
are pushing for it.</p>
<p>What stands in the way is that the member countries and their people don&#8217;t
actually want to strengthen the EU further.  The &#8220;lack of democracy&#8221; is very
much intentional and the exact outcome you get if you want to keep the power
with the national states.</p>
<h2>Foreign Billionaires and European Sovereignty</h2>
<p>So back to where we started: should the EU be abolished as Musk suggests?  I
think this is a profoundly unserious proposal from someone who has little
understanding of European history and even less interest in learning.  The EU
exists because two world wars taught Europeans that nationalism without checks
leads to catastrophe.  It exists because small countries recognized they have
more leverage negotiating as a bloc than individually.</p>
<p>I also take a lot of issue with the idea that European politics should be driven
by foreign interests.  Neither Russians nor Americans have any good reason for
why they should be having so much interest in European politics.  They are not
living here; we are.</p>
<p>Would Europe be more &#8220;free&#8221; without the EU?  Perhaps in some narrow regulatory
sense.  But it would also be weaker, more divided, and more susceptible to
manipulation by larger powers — including the United States.  I also find it
somewhat rich that American tech billionaires are calling for the dissolution of
the EU while they are greatly benefiting from the open market it provides.
Their companies extract enormous value from the European market, more than even
local companies are able to.</p>
<p>The real question isn&#8217;t whether Europe should have less regulation or more
freedom.  It&#8217;s whether we Europeans can find the political will to actually
complete the project we started.  A genuine federation with real fiscal
transfers, a common defense policy, and a unified foreign policy would be a
superpower.  What we have now is a compromise that satisfies nobody and leaves
us vulnerable to exactly the kind of pressure Musk and other oligarchs
represent.</p>
<h2>A Different Path</h2>
<p>Europe doesn&#8217;t need fixing in the way the loud present-day critics suggest.  It
doesn&#8217;t need to become more like America or abandon its social model entirely.
What it needs is to decide what it actually wants to be.  The current state of
perpetual ambiguity is unsustainable.</p>
<p>It also should not lose its values.  Europeans might no longer be quite as hot
on the human rights that the EU provides, and they might no longer want to have
the same level of immigration.  Yet simultaneously, Europeans are presented with
a reality that needs all of these things.  We&#8217;re all highly dependent on
movement of labour, and that includes people from abroad.  Unfortunately, the
wars of the last decade have dominated any migration discourse, and that has
created ground for populists to thrive.  Any skilled tech migrant is running
into the same walls as everyone else, which has made it less and less appealing
to come.</p>
<p>Or perhaps we&#8217;ll continue muddling through, which historically has been Europe&#8217;s
preferred approach.  It&#8217;s not inspiring, but it&#8217;s also not going to be the
catastrophe the internet would have you believe either.</p>
<p>Is there reason to be optimistic?  On a long enough timeline the graph goes up
and to the right.  We might be going through some rough patches, but
structurally the whole thing here is still pretty solid.  And it&#8217;s not as if the
rest of the world is cruising along smoothly: the US, China, and Russia are each
dealing with their own crises.  That shouldn&#8217;t serve as an excuse, but it does
offer context.  As bleak as things can feel, we&#8217;re not alone in having
challenges, but ours are uniquely ours and we will face them.  One way or
another.</p>

            <p>الأجواء في عالم التقنية تبدو مختلفة حالياً، أليس كذلك؟</p>

<p>قبل بضع سنوات، كان الحصول على وظيفة في مجال البيانات أو البرمجة يبدو طريقاً مباشراً وآمناً. تتعلم الأساسيات (Syntax)، تبني معرض أعمال (Portfolio)، وتضمن وظيفتك.  لكن ونحن نتجه نحو عام 2025، شبكة الأمان هذه بدأت تتلاشى .</p>

<p>السبب معروف للجميع. الذكاء الاصطناعي لم يعد مجرد “تريند”؛  إنه موجود بالفعل داخل محررات الأكواد التي نستخدمها يومياً .</p>

<p><strong>ولأنني أعلم أن الكلام النظري وحده لا يكفي لمواجهة هذا التغيير، أحضرت لك اليوم كورس بايثون كامل (مجاناً) لمساعدتك على البدء، ستجد رابطه في نهاية هذه الرسالة.</strong></p>

<p>إذا كان عملك اليومي يعتمد فقط على تحويل تعليمات واضحة إلى كود، فأنت في منطقة خطر .  لدينا الآن أدوات يمكنها كتابة الأكواد الروتينية (Boilerplate)، وبناء جمل SQL قوية، وتصميم واجهات مستخدم (UI) أسرع من أي إنسان .</p>

<p><strong>لكن الخبر الجيد هو أن الوظيفة لا تختفي، بل تنتقل إلى مستوى أعلى .</strong></p>

<p>السوق متعطش حالياً لمن يستطيع التفكير، التصميم، وحل المشكلات المعقدة والفوضوية .  لكي تبقى في المنافسة، يجب أن تتوقف عن كونك “مترجماً” للأوامر البرمجية، وتبدأ في التصرف كـ “مهندس أنظمة” .</p>

<p>إليك كيف تقوم بهذا التحول:</p>

<h3 id="1-فكر-في-الأنظمة-وليس-فقط-في-الأكواد-syntax">1. فكر في الأنظمة، وليس فقط في الأكواد (Syntax)</h3>

<p>معظمنا تعلم البرمجة عن طريق حفظ القواعد.  “هذه حلقة تكرار (Loop)”، أو “هذا كلاس (Class)” .</p>

<p>لكن هندسة البرمجيات الحقيقية تدور حول إدارة الفوضى.</p>

<p>لنأخذ <strong>البرمجة كائنية التوجه (OOP)</strong> كمثال . الأمر لا يتعلق فقط بإنشاء Class لـ “سيارة” أو “موظف”.  إنها طريقة لرسم خريطة لمشكلة تجارية معقدة حتى لا ينهار النظام لاحقاً تحت وطأة التعديلات .  الذكاء الاصطناعي يمكنه كتابة ملف Class في ثوانٍ، لكنه يفتقر إلى الرؤية لتخطيط كيفية تفاعل عشرين كائناً مختلفاً مع بعضهم البعض على مدار العامين المقبلين .</p>

<h3 id="2-لا-تنتظر-التذاكر-tickets">2. لا تنتظر التذاكر (Tickets)</h3>

<p>المطور العادي ينتظر أن تُسند إليه المهام.  المطور ذو القيمة العالية يبحث هو عن المشاكل ليحلها .</p>

<p>كل شركة مليئة بنقاط الاحتكاك وعدم الكفاءة .  فريق التسويق الذي يقوم بتعديل ملف Excel يدوياً كل يوم إثنين، أو فريق العمليات الذي ينسخ الملفات يدوياً بين المجلدات .</p>

<p>أنت بحاجة لتبني عقلية “الأتمتة أولاً” (Automation-First) .  تعلم كتابة السكربتات التي تتعامل مع ملفات النظام، وتنظم البيانات غير المهيكلة، وتتعامل مع الأخطاء بذكاء . إذا انقطع الاتصال، السكربت الضعيف يتوقف ويموت.  الأداة الجيدة تنتظر، تعيد المحاولة، تسجل الخطأ، وتستمر .</p>

<p>الذكاء الاصطناعي يمكنه كتابة السكربت إذا أعطيته التعليمات بالحرف.  لكن <strong>أنت</strong> من يجب أن يلاحظ الخلل ويصمم الأداة التي تحل المشكلة جذرياً .</p>

<h3 id="3-تعامل-مع-البيانات-كأنها-ذهب">3. تعامل مع البيانات كأنها ذهب</h3>

<p>في 2025، الوعي بالبيانات (Data Literacy) إلزامي .</p>

<p>يجب أن تفهم هياكل البيانات (Data Structures) بعمق.  لا أتحدث هنا عن اجتياز مقابلات العمل النظرية، بل عن فهم “المقايضات” (Trade-offs) .</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>List vs. Set:</strong> إذا كنت بحاجة للتحقق من وجود عنصر داخل مجموعة مليون مرة، استخدام List سيجعل النظام بطيئاً جداً.  استخدام Set سيقوم بالمهمة فوراً .</li>
  <li><strong>الثبات (Immutability):</strong> معرفة متى تستخدم Tuple بدلاً من List ليعرف المطورون الآخرون أن هذه البيانات <em>ممنوع تغييرها</em> .</li>
</ul>

<p>هذه القرارات الصغيرة هي ما يحدد ما إذا كان التطبيق سيعمل بسلاسة أم سيزحف ببطء .</p>

<h3 id="هديتك-للبدء-كورس-مجاني">هديتك للبدء (كورس مجاني)</h3>

<p>كما وعدتك في البداية، ولأن التطبيق هو الجزء الأهم .</p>

<p>إذا كنت تبحث عن مراجعة لهذه الأساسيات والآليات—من المبادئ الأولية وصولاً للصورة الأكبر في OOP والتعامل مع الملفات—فقد وجدت مصدراً تعليمياً ممتازاً .</p>

<p>الدورة بعنوان: <strong>Python Complete Course For Beginners</strong> .</p>

<p>إنها تغطي الأساسيات التقنية التي تحتاجها للانتقال من مجرد “كتابة أكواد” إلى بناء أنظمة متكاملة .  عادةً ما تكون هذه الدورة مدفوعة، لكن الرابط أدناه يلغي الرسوم لفترة محدودة .</p>

          <p class="text-base-content">
            <p>Last week <a href="https://pypi.org/project/urllib3/2.6.0/">urllib3 v2.6.0 was released</a> which contained removals for
several APIs that we've known were problematic since 2019 and
<a href="https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/pull/2814">have been deprecated since 2022</a>. The deprecations
were marked in the documentation, changelog, and what I incorrectly believed
would be the most meaningful signal to users: <a href="https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/commit/19582a1f35ae810f97dc46897232770c810c197a#diff-008f01f06c84456177464927734cc849c073b1f3d13bfab947ff812a5b4ac965">with a <code>DeprecationWarning</code>
being emitted</a> for each use for the API.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>The API that urllib3 recommended users use instead has the same
features and no compatibility issues between urllib3 1.x and 2.x:</p>

<div class="codehilite">
<pre><span></span><code><span class="n">resp</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">urllib3</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">request</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;GET&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;https://example.com&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="c1"># Deprecated APIs</span>
<span class="n">resp</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">getheader</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;Content-Length&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">resp</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">getheaders</span><span class="p">()</span>

<span class="c1"># Recommended APIs</span>
<span class="n">resp</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">headers</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;Content-Length&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">resp</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">headers</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>This API was emitting warnings for over 3 years in a top-3 Python package by downloads urging libraries
and users to stop using the API and <strong>that was not enough</strong>. We still received feedback
from users that this removal was unexpected and was breaking dependent libraries.
We ended up <a href="https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/pull/3732">adding the APIs back</a> and creating a hurried release to fix the issue.</p>

<p>It's not clear to me that
waiting longer would have helped, either. The libraries that were impacted
are actively developed, like the Kubernetes client, Fastly client, and Airflow
and I trust that if the message had reached them they would have taken action.</p>

<p>My conclusion from this incident is that <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#DeprecationWarning"><code>DeprecationWarning</code></a> in its current state does not
work for deprecating APIs, at least for Python libraries. That is
unfortunate, as <code>DeprecationWarning</code> and the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/warnings.html"><code>warnings</code> module</a>
are easy-to-use, language-“blessed”, and explicit without impacting users that don't
need to take action due to deprecations. Any other method of deprecating
API features is likely to be home-grown and different across each project
which is far worse for users and project maintainers.</p>

<h2>Possible solutions?</h2>

<p><code>DeprecationWarning</code> is called out in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/warnings.html#updating-code-for-new-versions-of-dependencies">“ignored by default” list</a>
for Python. I could ask for more Python developers to run with warnings enabled, but solutions in the form of “if only we could all just” are a folly.
Maybe the answer is for each library to create its own
“deprecation warning” equivalent just to not be in the “ignored by default” list:</p>

<div class="codehilite">
<pre><span></span><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">warnings</span>

<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Urllib3DeprecationWarning</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ne">UserWarning</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">pass</span>

<span class="n">warnings</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">warn</span><span class="p">(</span>
    <span class="s2">&quot;HTTPResponse.getheader() is deprecated&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="n">category</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">Urllib3DeprecationWarning</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="n">stacklevel</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">2</span>
<span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Maybe the answer is to do away with advance notice and adopt SemVer with many major versions, similar to
how Cryptography operates for API compatibility. Let me know if
you have other ideas.</p>

            <p>Remember the pure, unadulterated joy (and occasional rage) of games like Breakout and Arkanoid? Dodging, bouncing, and strategically smashing bricks for that satisfying <em>thwack</em>?</p>

<p>Well, get ready for <strong>brkrs</strong> – a modern, full-featured brick-breaker that brings all that classic arcade action to a new generation, built with cutting-edge <strong><a href="https://rust-lang.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rust</a></strong> 🦀 and the incredibly flexible <strong><a href="https://bevy.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bevy</a></strong> game engine!</p>

<p><strong>Want to jump straight into the action or peek under the hood? Find everything here:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/cleder/brkrs" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>github.com/cleder/brkrs</strong></a></p>

<p><strong>brkrs</strong> isn't just another clone; it's a love letter to the genre, packed with modern physics, dynamic levels, and a secret weapon: it's entirely open-source, designed for you to play, tinker, and even contribute!</p>




<h2>
  
  
  🚀 The Story: From Retro Dreams to Modern Reality
</h2>

<p>Many of us have dreamed of remaking our favorite classics. For me, that dream was to revive an old <a href="https://github.com/cleder/yaac" rel="noopener noreferrer">Arkanoid-style game, "YaAC 🐧"</a>, using today's best game development tools. What started as a manual journey quickly evolved into something much more: a real game that's also a living showcase of modern game dev practices.</p>

<p>It’s built on a philosophy of "Kaizen no michi" (改善の道) – making small, continuous improvements. This means the game is always evolving, and every change is carefully considered.</p>




<h2>
  
  
  🕹️ Play It Now: Levels That Challenge, Physics That Impress
</h2>

<p>No downloads needed to get a taste of the action!</p>

<p><a href="https://cleder.github.io/brkrs/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Hit up the web version and start smashing bricks here</strong></a></p>

<p>Sorry at this time its only 2 levels (it is still early in the development process), but 70 more (lifted from YAAC) are coming soon, so stay tuned, or even better, help to make it come true ;-)</p>

<p><strong>brkrs</strong> extends the classic formula with some seriously cool features:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Classic Gameplay, Modern Feel:</strong> Paddle, ball, and bricks, but with a polished, satisfying punch.</li>
<li>
<strong>Rich Physics (Rapier3D):</strong> Experience accurate and engaging ball physics that make every bounce feel real.</li>
<li>
<strong>Dynamic Levels:</strong> Human-readable and easy-to-modify level configurations mean endless possibilities for custom stages.</li>
<li>
<strong>Paddle Rotation:</strong> Add a new layer of skill and strategy to your shots.</li>
<li>
<strong>Cross-Platform Fun:</strong> Play it on your desktop or directly in your browser thanks to WebAssembly!</li>
</ul>




<h2>
  
  
  🛠️ Go Deeper: A Game for Builders, Too
</h2>

<p>For those who love to dive into the mechanics of their favourite games, <strong>brkrs</strong> is a treasure trove. It's not just playable; it's also a fantastic example of a well-structured <strong><a href="https://rust-lang.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rust</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://bevy.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bevy</a></strong> project.</p>

<p><strong>Want to try building it yourself?</strong> You'll need Rust, Cargo, and Git.<br />
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight shell"><code>git clone https://github.com/cleder/brkrs.git
<span class="nb">cd </span>brkrs
cargo run <span class="nt">--release</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p><strong>Controls:</strong> Move the paddle with your mouse, use the scroll wheel to rotate (if enabled), and hit ESC to pause.</p>

<p>This is your chance to not just play, but to truly <strong>tinker</strong>. Ever wanted to add a new power-up? Change how a brick explodes? Or even design your own crazy levels? <strong>brkrs</strong> makes it approachable.</p>




<h2>
  
  
  🧠 Behind the Scenes: Spec-Driven Awesomeness
</h2>

<p>The game's development isn't just chaotic coding; it's built on <strong>spec-driven development (SDD)</strong>. This means every feature starts with a clear, detailed plan, much like a game designer's blueprint. We even use <strong><a href="https://github.com/github/spec-kit?tab=readme-ov-file#-spec-kit" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub's spec-kit</a></strong> to formalize these plans. It's a structured way to ensure every piece of the game works exactly as intended, minimizing bugs and maximizing fun.</p>

<p>And here's the kicker: this clear, step-by-step approach makes <strong>brkrs</strong> a perfect playground for experimenting with <strong>AI-assisted coding</strong>. Imagine using AI to help design a new brick type or tweak game logic – the structured specs make it surprisingly effective!</p>




<h2>
  
  
  📣 Help Wanted: Your Skills Can Level Up <strong>brkrs</strong>!
</h2>

<p>While the code is solid, a great game needs more than just logic! We are actively looking for creative community members to join the effort and help turn <strong>brkrs</strong> into a visually and aurally stunning experience.</p>

<p>This is your chance to get your work into a real, playable, open-source game!</p>

            <p>Tired of tutorial code that stops working the moment the lesson ends? Meet <strong>brkrs</strong>—a fully playable, Arkanoid/Breakout-style game written in <strong><a href="https://rust-lang.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rust</a></strong> 🦀 and built with the <strong><a href="https://bevy.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bevy</a></strong> engine.</p>

<p>But this isn't just a game. It's an open-source <strong>learning playground</strong> dedicated to <strong>spec-first development</strong> and <strong>AI-assisted coding experiments.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Check out the full repository here:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/cleder/brkrs?tab=readme-ov-file#readme" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>github.com/cleder/brkrs</strong></a></p>

<p>As Linus Torvalds famously said: <strong>“Talk is cheap. Show me the code.”</strong> We say: <strong>"Show me the game, the spec, and the code all at once!"</strong></p>




<h2>
  
  
  💡 The Philosophy: Spec-First, Incremental, and AI-Ready
</h2>

<p>Game development, especially in a framework like <strong>Bevy</strong>, can be a steep climb. The brkrs project was born from the desire to take an old idea <a href="https://github.com/cleder/yaac" rel="noopener noreferrer">(an Arkanoid clone)</a> and build it the modern way—a way that accelerates learning and embraces new tooling.</p>

<p>We follow a simple, yet powerful, development loop:</p>

<ol>
<li> <strong>Spec-First:</strong> Every single feature, no matter how small, begins as a clear specification using GitHub's <strong>speckit</strong>.</li>
<li> <strong>Incremental PRs:</strong> The spec flows through a small, focused issue or Pull Request. This embodies the "<strong>Kaizen no michi</strong>" (改善の道) philosophy of small, positive, daily changes.</li>
<li> <strong>Code &amp; Play:</strong> The result is working <strong>Rust</strong> code you can immediately see in the game.</li>
</ol>

<p>This structured approach makes <strong>brkrs</strong> the perfect sandbox for the AI coding community:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Agentic Testing:</strong> Need a small, contained task for your coding agent? Point it at a spec and a pending issue.</li>
<li>
<strong>AI-Assisted Feature Dev:</strong> Want to see how your favorite LLM handles adding a new brick behavior or adjusting physics? The clear specs provide the perfect prompt.</li>
<li>
<strong>Workflow Learning:</strong> Every merged PR is a clean, documented example of how a real-world feature is implemented in <strong>Rust</strong>/Bevy.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
  
  
  What is Spec-Driven Development?
</h3>

<p>The core of our workflow is the use of <strong><a href="https://github.com/github/spec-kit?tab=readme-ov-file#-spec-kit" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub's spec-kit</a></strong>. This is a framework for <strong>spec-driven development (SDD)</strong>, an approach where detailed, human-readable specifications are written <em>before</em> any code. SDD serves as the single source of truth for the desired behavior of a feature. By providing clear inputs, outputs, and requirements upfront, it minimizes guesswork, aligns team expectations, and provides a perfect, structured input for any AI coding assistant or agent.</p>

  🕹️ Try It Now: Playable &amp; Pluggable
</h2>

<p>You don't need to compile anything to get started!</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://cleder.github.io/brkrs/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Play the live web version right now</a></strong>!</p>

<p>The core experience extends the classic Breakout formula with:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Richer Physics</strong> (via Rapier3D) constrained to a flat 2D plane.</li>
<li>
<strong>Paddle Rotation</strong> and customizable per-level settings.</li>
<li>
<strong>Human-readable Levels</strong> that are easy to modify and extend using RON files.</li>
</ul>




<h2>
  
  
  🛠️ Quickstart: Play, Tweak, and Learn
</h2>

<p>Ready to dive into the code? You'll need <strong>Rust</strong>, Cargo, and Git.<br />
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight shell"><code>git clone https://github.com/cleder/brkrs.git
<span class="nb">cd </span>brkrs
cargo run <span class="nt">--release</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p><strong>Controls:</strong> Move the paddle with the mouse, use the scroll wheel to rotate, and ESC to pause.</p>

<p>Now, the fun begins. Want to change the gravity for Level 3? Want to create a new <code>HyperBrick</code> component? The entire architecture—from the <strong>Level Loader</strong> to the <strong>Brick System</strong>—is designed for easy modification.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Following the Samurai principle of "<strong>Seika no Ho</strong>" (清華の法), "the way of clear planning," pick a small feature, write a mini-spec, and implement it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>
  
  
  🤝 Your Learning Path and Contribution
</h2>

<p>The goal is to make learning modern <strong>Rust</strong>/Bevy development as enjoyable as playing the game.</p>

<p>Here’s how you can engage:</p>

<ol>
<li> <strong>Read a Spec:</strong> Check out the repo or wiki for a feature you'd like to see.</li>
<li> <strong>Pick an Issue:</strong> Find a small, contained task that aligns with a spec.</li>
<li> <strong>Experiment with AI:</strong> Use your favourite AI tool (e.g., GitHub Copilot, a local agent) to help draft the code for the task.</li>
<li> <strong>Submit a PR:</strong> Show the community how you turned a spec into working <strong>Rust</strong> code!</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>brkrs</strong> is more than just a Breakout clone—it’s a living textbook for best practices in modern, spec-driven, and AI-augmented software development.</p>

            <p>هل سبق ووجدت دورة تدريبية مثالية، ثم تراجعت فوراً عند رؤية سعرها الذي يتجاوز 100 أو 200 دولار؟</p>

<p>لقد كنت في هذا الموقف مراراً. في بداياتي، كنت أعتقد أن التعليم “المعتمد” حكر على من يملكون المال. كنت أرى شهادات زملائي على LinkedIn وأتساءل: “هل دفعوا حقاً كل هذه المبالغ؟”.</p>

<p>الإجابة التي قد تفاجئك هي: <strong>لا</strong>.</p>

<p>اكتشفت لاحقاً أن هناك “أبواباً خلفية” شرعية تماماً تضعها منصات مثل <strong>Coursera</strong> و <strong>Udemy</strong> لدعم المتعلمين، لكنها لا تعلن عنها بشكل واضح في الصفحة الرئيسية. اليوم، سأشاركك هذه الأسرار بصفتي خضت التجربة بنفسي. هذا ليس مجرد مقال نظري، بل هو خارطة طريق ستوفر عليك مئات الدولارات وتمنح سيرتك الذاتية (CV) الثقل الذي تستحقه.</p>

<p>دعنا ندخل في التفاصيل العملية فوراً.</p>

<h2 id="1-منصة-كورسيرا-coursera-كيف-تدرس-في-جامعة-ييل-مجاناً">1. منصة كورسيرا (Coursera): كيف تدرس في “جامعة ييل” مجاناً؟</h2>

<p>تعتبر كورسيرا “الوحش الأكاديمي” في عالم التعليم أونلاين، حيث تقدم محتوى من جامعات عالمية (مثل ستانفورد، ميتشيغان، ولندن). المشكلة أن الكثيرين يختارون خيار “المستمع” (Audit) للدراسة مجاناً، ثم يصدمون في النهاية بأنهم <strong>لن يحصلوا على شهادة</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="الحل-السري-المساعدة-المالية-financial-aid">الحل السري: المساعدة المالية (Financial Aid)</h3>

<p>أغلب الدورات، حتى تلك التابعة لدرجات الماجستير المصغرة، تحتوي على رابط صغير جداً ومخفي بعناية يسمى “Financial aid available”. إليك الخطوات بدقة لضمان قبول طلبك:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>لا تضغط على زر “Enroll For Free”:</strong> هذا الزر سيقودك غالباً لفترة تجريبية مدفوعة لاحقاً. بدلاً من ذلك، ابحث عن رابط صغير بجوار العنوان الرئيسي للدورة مكتوب عليه “Financial aid available”.</li>
  <li><strong>املأ الطلب بذكاء:</strong> سيطلب منك الموقع كتابة إجابات قصيرة (حوالي 150 كلمة).
    <ul>
      <li><strong>لماذا تطلب الدعم؟</strong> كن صادقاً وواقعياً. تحدث عن وضعك كطالب، أو اختلاف سعر العملة في بلدك، وأن المبلغ المطلوب يعادل راتب شهر كامل في منطقتك. هذه الحقائق تقنعهم جداً.</li>
      <li><strong>كيف ستساعدك الدورة؟</strong> ابتعد عن العموميات. قل بوضوح: “هذه الشهادة في (تحليل البيانات) ستؤهلني للتقديم على وظيفة (محلل مبتدئ) التي أطمح لها، حيث تشترط الشركات لدينا وجود شهادة معتمدة”.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>انتظر 15 يوماً:</strong> نعم، الأمر يتطلب صبراً، لكن نسبة القبول تتجاوز 90% إذا كانت إجاباتك حقيقية وغير منسوخة من الإنترنت.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>نصيحة خبير:</strong> إذا كنت متحمساً ولا تطيق الانتظار، يمكنك البدء في الدراسة بنظام “Audit” فور تقديم الطلب. وعندما تأتيك الموافقة بعد أسبوعين، سيتم تحويل حسابك تلقائياً للنسخة المدفوعة وستحصل على الشهادة عند الإكمال.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="2-منصة-يوديمي-udemy-استراتيجية-صائد-الكوبونات">2. منصة يوديمي (Udemy): استراتيجية “صائد الكوبونات”</h2>

<p>يوديمي يختلف عن كورسيرا؛ فهو سوق مفتوح للمدربين. المدرب الجديد يحتاج بشدة لطلاب وتقييمات (Reviews) لكي تنجح دورته وتظهر في البحث، لذلك يقوم بتوزيع “كوبونات خصم 100%” لفترة محدودة جداً (أحياناً لساعات أو أيام قليلة).</p>

<h3 id="الخطأ-الذي-يقع-فيه-الجميع">الخطأ الذي يقع فيه الجميع</h3>
<p>الدخول للموقع والبحث بفلتر “Free”. الدورات المجانية الدائمة على يوديمي <strong>لا تمنح شهادة إتمام</strong> في الغالب، هي للمشاهدة فقط.</p>

<h3 id="الاستراتيجية-الصحيحة">الاستراتيجية الصحيحة</h3>
<p>أنت تبحث عن دورة “مدفوعة” أصبح سعرها صفراً باستخدام كوبون. هذه الدورات تمنحك شهادة لأن النظام يعتبرك قد “اشتريتها” بالفعل.</p>

<h3 id="أين-تجد-هذه-الكوبونات-كنز-المصادر-العربية">أين تجد هذه الكوبونات؟ (كنز المصادر العربية)</h3>

<p>بدلاً من البحث العشوائي في جوجل والوقوع في روابط منتهية الصلاحية، أنصحك بمتابعة مصادر موثوقة تقوم بتجميع هذه الكوبونات يومياً. إليك أفضل 3 مصادر أستخدمها شخصياً:</p>

<h4 id="أ-موقع-أحمد-بوشفرة-للكوبونات-محدث-يومياً">أ) موقع أحمد بوشفرة للكوبونات (محدث يومياً)</h4>
<p>هذا الموقع يعتبر مرجعاً شاملاً وسهلاً للتصفح. يتميز بأنه يجمع لك أفضل الكوبونات المجانية لدورات البرمجة والتصميم والتقنية في مكان واحد، مما يغنيك عن البحث في عشرات المواقع الأخرى.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>رابط الموقع:</strong> <a href="https://ahmedbouchefra.com/free-courses">free-courses</a></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="ب-قناة-البرمجة-العربية-المجانية-تيليجرام">ب) قناة البرمجة العربية المجانية (تيليجرام)</h4>
<p>هذه القناة تعتبر منجم ذهب للمبرمجين والتقنيين. ينشرون باستمرار كوبونات لدورات بايثون، تطوير الويب، والذكاء الاصطناعي. الميزة هنا هي السرعة؛ فالكوبون قد ينفد خلال ساعات أو أيام، ووجودك في القناة يضمن لك التقاطه فور صدوره.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>رابط القناة:</strong> <a href="https://t.me/freearabprogramming">Arab Free Programming</a></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="ج-قناة-التحديثات-الفورية-ماسنجر">ج) قناة التحديثات الفورية (ماسنجر)</h4>
<p>إذا كنت تفضل وصول الإشعارات مباشرة إلى فيسبوك ماسنجر الخاص بك، فقناة أحمد بوشفرة توفر تحديثات مباشرة وسريعة لأفضل الفرص التعليمية. أنصح بتفعيل التنبيهات فيها لضمان عدم تفويت الفرص الحصرية.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>رابط القناة:</strong> <a href="https://www.messenger.com/channel/ahmed.bouchefra/AbYVVHGuudwsRByI/">تابع التحديثات هنا</a></li>

<h2 id="3-مهارات-من-جوجل-google-الشهادة-التي-تحبها-الشركات">3. مهارات من جوجل (Google): الشهادة التي تحبها الشركات</h2>

<p>إذا كنت مبتدئاً وتريد شيئاً قوياً تضعه في بداية سيرتك الذاتية، فلا شيء يتفوق على شهادات جوجل، خاصة في العالم العربي، فهي تعطي انطباعاً بالجدية والاحترافية.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>منصة “مهارات من Google”:</strong> تقدم دورة شهيرة جداً بعنوان <strong>“أساسيات التسويق الرقمي”</strong>. هذه الدورة ليست مجرد فيديوهات عابرة، بل منهج كامل معتمد من “Interactive Advertising Bureau”. والأجمل؟ أنها باللغة العربية بالكامل ومجانية 100%.</li>
  <li><strong>شهادات جوجل الاحترافية (Career Certificates):</strong> في مجالات مثل (IT Support, Data Analytics, UX Design). هذه الدورات مدفوعة عادة على كورسيرا، ولكن جوجل تقدم آلاف المنح سنوياً عبر شركاء محليين في مصر والسعودية والمغرب والإمارات. ابحث في جوجل عن “منحة جوجل + اسم بلدك” وستجد المؤسسات التي توزع هذه المنح (مثل وزارة الاتصالات أو منظمات الشباب).</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="4-لينكد-إن-linkedin-learning-اللمسة-الاحترافية">4. لينكد إن (LinkedIn Learning): اللمسة الاحترافية</h2>

<p>شهادات هذه المنصة تظهر بشكل أنيق جداً في ملفك الشخصي وتلفت انتباه مسؤولي التوظيف (Recruiters) لأنها تثبت أنك نشط وتطور نفسك باستمرار.</p>

<p><strong>الحيلة البسيطة (The Trial Hack):</strong>
المنصة تمنح شهراً مجانياً واحداً (Free Month) للمستخدمين الجدد.</p>
<ol>
  <li>سجل للاشتراك المجاني (يتطلب إدخال بطاقة، لكن لن يتم الخصم).</li>
  <li>حدد 3 مهارات تريد تعلمها بتركيز (مثلاً: التفاوض، الإكسل المتقدم، القيادة).</li>
  <li>أنهِ الدورات واحصل على الشهادات واحفظها (Download PDF).</li>
  <li><strong>مهم جداً:</strong> قم بإلغاء الاشتراك قبل نهاية الشهر بيوم واحد. ستحتفظ بالشهادات التي حصلت عليها ولن تدفع شيئاً.</li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h2 id="خارطة-الطريق-ماذا-تفعل-الآن">خارطة الطريق: ماذا تفعل الآن؟</h2>

<p>يا صديقي، تجميع الشهادات ليس هواية، والشهادة هي “وسيلة” وليست “غاية”.
نصيحتي لك من واقع خبرة عملية لكي تستفيد فعلاً:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>حدد هدفاً واحداً:</strong> لا تشتت نفسك. هل تريد تعلم البرمجة؟ اذهب لقائمة الكوبونات في الموقع الذي ذكرته لك بالأعلى. هل تريد التسويق؟ ابدأ بمهارات من جوجل.</li>
  <li><strong>التزم:</strong> الحصول على الدورة مجاناً قد يجعلك تتكاسل عن إكمالها لأنك “لم تدفع شيئاً”. عاملها وكأنك دفعت فيها 100 دولار من جيبك الخاص.</li>
  <li><strong>شارك هذا الخير:</strong> هناك الآلاف من الطلاب العرب يبحثون عن هذه الفرص وتائهون في دوامة المحتوى المدفوع. مشاركتك لهذا الدليل قد تكون سبباً في حصول شخص على وظيفة وتغيير حياته.</li>
</ol>

<p>العلم متاح للجميع الآن، والكرة في ملعبك. ابدأ اليوم، ولا تدع عائق المال يوقفك بعد الآن.</p>

            <p>I have just released version 0.9.11 of Shed Skin, a restricted-Python-to-C++ compiler. Most importantly, it adds support for Python 3.14. It also adds support for many 3.x features that were not yet implemented, in addition to basic support for the base64 module. It also optimizes a few more common code patterns.

<p>Paul Boddie was able to add support for libpcre2, and in the process updated conan to version 2. Thanks to Shakeeb and now Paul, Shed Skin has had first-class Windows support for the last few releases.

<p>A new release is often triggered by a nice new example. In this case I found an advanced/educational 3d renderer by Benny Bobaganoosh, and rewrote it from Java to Python. In ~500 lines of code, it renders an .obj file with perspective-correct texture mapping and so on, clipping, lighting.. It becomes about 13 times faster after compilation (in other words, it goes from about 2 to about 30 FPS).

<p>For the full list of changes in the release, please see the <a href="https://github.com/shedskin/shedskin/releases/tag/v0.9.11">release notes</a>.

<p>Something I have noticed while working on this release is that small object allocations seem to have become faster under Linux, to the degree that programs that would become _slower_ after compilation because of excessive small-object allocation, are now usually _faster_ again, at least on my system. This motivated me to measure the speedup for all 84 example programs at the moment versus cpython 3.13. While it's still all over the place, I was happy to see a median speedup of 12 times, and an average of 20 times.

<p>I would very much appreciate more feedback on/assistance with the project. There is always enough low-hanging fruit to help with! See for example the current list of issues for 0.9.12. But just testing random things, finding interesting new example programs, cleaning up parts of the code and such are also much appreciated.
