<p>Let’s spend some time getting to know Simon better!</p>
<h4 id="s-can-you-tell-us-a-little-about-yourself-hobbies-education-etc">Can you tell us a little about yourself (hobbies, education, etc)</h4>
<p>My name is Simon Charette and I'm based in Montréal. I've been contributing to Django for over a decade mainly to the ORM and I have a background in software engineering and mathematics. I work as a principal backend engineer at Zapier where we use Python and Django to power many of our backend services. Outside of Django and work I like to spend time cycling around the world, traveling with my partner, and playing ultimate frisbee. </p>
<h4 id="s-out-of-curiosity-your-github-profile-picture-appears-to-be-a-frisbee-is-it-correct-if-so-have-you-been-playing-for-a-long-time">Out of curiosity, your GitHub profile picture appears to be a Frisbee, is it correct? If so, have you been playing for a long time?</h4>
<p>I've been playing ultimate frisbee since college which is around the time I started contributing to Django. It has been a huge part of my life since then as I made many friends and met my partner playing through the years. My commitment to ultimate frisbee can be reflected in my volume of contributions over the past decade as it requires more of my time during certain periods of the year. It also explains why I wasn't able to attend most DjangoCon in spring and fall as this is usually a pretty busy time for me. I took part in the world championships twice and I played in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Frisbee_Association">the UFA</a> for about 5 years before retiring three years ago. Nowadays I still play but at a lower intensity level and I am focused on giving back to the community through coaching. </p>
<h4 id="s-how-did-you-start-using-django">How did you start using Django?</h4>
<p>Back in college I was working part time for a web agency that had an in house PHP framework and was trying to determine which tech stack and framework they should migrate to in order to ease onboarding of their developers and reduce their maintenance costs. I was tasked, with another member of the team, to identify potential candidates and despite my lack of familiarity with Python at the time we ended up choosing Django over PHP's Symphony mainly because of its spectacular documentation and third-party app ecosystem. </p>
<h4 id="s-what-other-framework-do-you-know-and-if-there-is-anything-you-would-like-to-have-in-django-if-you-had-magical-powers">What other framework do you know and if there is anything you would like to have in Django if you had magical powers?</h4>
<p>If I had magical powers I'd invent Python ergonomics to elegantly address the function coloring problem so it's easier for Django to be adapted to an <code>async</code>-ready world. I'm hopeful that the recent development on the GIL removal in Python 3.13+ will result a renewed interest in the usage of threading, which Django is well equipped to take advantage of, over the systematic usage of an event loop to deal with web serving workloads as the async world comes with a lot of often overlooked drawbacks. </p>
<h4 id="s-what-projects-are-you-working-on-now">What projects are you working on now?</h4>
<p>I have a few Django related projects I'm working on mainly relating to ORM improvements (deprecating <code>extra</code>, better usage of <code>RETURNING</code> when available) but the main one has been a tool to keep track of the SQL generated by the Django test suite over time to more easily identity unintended changes that still pass the test suite. My goal with this project is to have a CI invokable command that would run the full Django test suite and provide a set of tests that generated different SQL compared to the target branch so its much easier to identify unintended side effects when making invasive changes to the ORM. </p>
<h4 id="s-which-django-libraries-are-your-favorite-core-or-3rd-party">Which Django libraries are your favorite (core or 3rd party)?</h4>
<ul>
<li>DRF </li>
<li>django-filter </li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/charettes/django-seal"><code>django-seal</code></a> (shameless plug) </li>
</ul>
<h4 id="s-what-are-the-top-three-things-in-django-that-you-like">What are the top three things in Django that you like?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The people </li>
<li>The ORM, unsurprisingly </li>
<li>The many entry points the framework provides to allow very powerful third-party apps to be used together </li>
</ul>
<h4 id="s-youve-contributed-significantly-to-improving-the-django-orm-what-do-you-believe-is-the-next-big-challenge-for-django-orm-and-how-do-you-envision-it-evolving-in-the-coming-years">You've contributed significantly to improving the Django ORM. What do you believe is the next big challenge for Django ORM, and how do you envision it evolving in the coming years?</h4>
<p>The ORM's expression interface is already very powerful but there are effectively <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNlGFrIBl8o">some remaining rough edges</a>. I believe that adding generalized support for composite virtual fields (a field composed of other fields) could solve many problems we currently face with how relationships are expressed between models as we currently lack a way to describe an expression that can return tuples of values internally. If we had this building block, adding a way to express and compose table expressions (CTE, subquery pushdown, aggregation through subqueries) would be much easier to implement without denaturing the ORM by turning it into a low level query builder. Many of these things are possible today (e.g. <a href="github.com/dimagi/django-cte">django-cte</a>) but they require a lot of SQL compilation and ORM knowledge and can hardly be composed together. </p>
<h4 id="s-how-did-you-start-to-contribute-to-the-orm-what-would-be-the-advice-you-have-for-someone-interested-to-contribute-to-this-field">How did you start to contribute to the ORM? What would be the advice you have for someone interested to contribute to this field?</h4>
<p>I started small by fixing a few issues that I cared about and by taking the time to read through Trac, mailing lists, and <code>git-blame</code> for changes in the area that were breaking tests as attempted to make changes. One thing that greatly helps in onboarding on the ORM is to at least have some good SQL fundamentals. When I first started I already had written a MSSQL ORM in PHP which helped me at least understand the idea behind the generation of SQL from a higher level abstraction. Nowadays there are tons of resources out there to help you get started on understand how things are organized but I would suggest this particular video where <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IakfTkQIuFw">I attempt to walk through the different phases of SQL generation</a>. </p>
<h4 id="s-is-there-anything-else-youd-like-to-say">Is there anything else you’d like to say?</h4>
<p>It has been a pleasure to be able to be part of this community for so long and I'd like to personally thank Claude Paroz for initially getting me interested in contributing seriously to the project.</p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p> </p>
<p dir="auto">eGenix has long been running a <b>local user group meeting</b> in Düsseldorf
called <a href="/library/pyddf/">Python Meeting Düsseldorf</a> and we are using a Telegram group
for most of our communication.</p>


<p dir="auto">In the early days, the group worked well and we only had few spammers
joining it, which we could well handle manually.</p>

<p dir="auto">More recently, this has
changed dramatically. <b>We are seeing between 2-5 spam signups per day,
often at night.</b> Furthermore, the signups accounts are not always easy to
spot as spammers, since they often come with profile images,
descriptions, etc.</p>



<p dir="auto"><b>With the bot, we now have a more flexible way of dealing with the
problem.</b></p>
<p align="center" dir="auto"><b><a href="/library/telegram-antispam-bot/">Please see our project page for details and download links.</a><br />
  </b></p>
<p dir="auto">
</p>
<p>
</p>


<h2><a href="/products/python/PyRun/#Features" name="Features">Features</a></h2>

<ul dir="auto">
<li><b>Low impact mode of operation</b>: the bot tries to keep noise in the group
to a minimum</li><li><b>Several challenge mechanisms to choose from</b>, more can be added as
needed</li><li>Flexible and easy to use configuration</li><li>Only needs a few MB of RAM, so can easily be put into a container or run
on a Raspberry Pi</li><li>Can handle quite a bit of load due to the <b>async implementation</b></li><li>Works with <b>Python 3.9+</b></li>
  <li><b>MIT open source licensed<br />
</b></li>
</ul>
<h2>News</h2>


<p>The 0.7.1 release fixes a few bugs and adds more features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Added missing dependency on emoji package to setup (bug introduced in 0.7.0, fixed in 0.7.1)<br />
</li>
<li>Added user name check for number of emojis, since these are being used a lot by spammers</li>
<li>Added wheel as requirement, since this is no longer included per default</li>
<li>Updated copyright year</li>
</ul>

<ul></ul>
<p>It has been battle-tested in production for several years already 
and is proving to be a really useful tool to help with Telegram group 
administration.<br />

            Python has many string formatting styles which have been added to the language over the years. Early Python used the % operator to injected formatted values into strings. And we have string.format() which offers several powerful styles. Both were verbose and indirect, so f-strings were added in Python 3.6. But these f-strings lacked security features (think little bobby tables) and they manifested as fully-formed strings to runtime code. Today we talk about the next evolution of Python string formatting for advanced use-cases (SQL, HTML, DSLs, etc): t-strings. We have Paul Everitt, David Peck, and Jim Baker on the show to introduce this upcoming new language feature.

            When working with Qt slots and signals in PySide6 you will discover the <code>@Slot</code> decorator. This decorator is used to <em>mark</em> a Python function or method as a <em>slot</em> to which a Qt signal can be connected. However, as you can see in our <a href="">signals and slots tutorials</a> you don't <em>have</em> to use this. Any Python function or method can be used, normally, as a slot for a Qt signals. But elsewhere, in our <a href="https://www.pythonguis.com/tutorials/multithreading-pyside6-applications-qthreadpool/">threading tutorials</a> we <em>do</em> use it.

            <p>What is the character encoding for Animal Crossing?
<a href="https://nookipedia.com/wiki/Secret_code/Generator">This page</a> details all the characters that are allowed for player
names, town names, and passwords in Animal Crossing for the GameCube. A much larger
character set was used for writing mail and communication.</p>

<p>Each character was internally represented as a value between <code>0x00</code> and <code>0xFF</code>
which is the same size as ASCII, thus me naming this encoding “Animal CrosSCII”.
The characters between <code>0xD5</code> and <code>0xDE</code> are only used in the EU version. <code>0xDF</code> to <code>0xFF</code> are unused.</p>

<p>The names of the characters (and descriptions when ambiguous) were sourced from the <a href="https://github.com/ACreTeam/ac-decomp/blob/da0c91fd94282e5fa8999a2f5ace5304f2d95288/include/m_font.h#L14">Animal Crossing decompilation project</a>.
I've mapped each character to the best of my ability back to Unicode
and collected them in a table below:</p>

<p><strong>This is a beta preview of Python 3.14</strong></p>
<p>Python 3.14 is still in development. This release, 3.14.0b1, is the
first of four planned beta releases.</p>
<p>Beta release previews are intended to give the wider community the
opportunity to test new features and bug fixes and to prepare their
projects to support the new feature release.</p>
<p>We <strong><em>strongly encourage</em></strong> maintainers of
third-party Python projects to <strong><em>test with 3.14</em></strong>
during the beta phase and report issues found to <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues">the Python bug
tracker</a> as soon as possible. While the release is planned to be
feature-complete entering the beta phase, it is possible that features
may be modified or, in rare cases, deleted up until the start of the
release candidate phase (Tuesday 2025-07-22). Our goal is to have
<strong><em>no ABI changes</em></strong> after beta 4 and as few code
changes as possible after the first release candidate. To achieve that,
it will be <strong><em>extremely important</em></strong> to get as much
exposure for 3.14 as possible during the beta phase.</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that this is a preview release and its use is
<strong><em>not</em></strong> recommended for production
environments.</p>

<h1 id="note">Note</h1>
<p>During the release process, we discovered a test that only failed
when run sequentially and only when run after a certain number of other
tests. This appears to be a problem with the test itself, and we will
make it more robust for beta 2. For details, see <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/133532">python/cpython#133532</a>.</p>
<h1 id="and-now-for-something-completely-different">And now for
something completely different</h1>
<p>The mathematical constant pi is represented by the Greek letter
<em>π</em> and represents the ratio of a circle’s circumference to its
diameter. The first person to use <em>π</em> as a symbol for this ratio
was Welsh self-taught mathematician William Jones in 1706. He was a
farmer’s son born in Llanfihangel Tre’r Beirdd on Angelsy (Ynys Môn) in
1675 and only received a basic education at a local charity school.
However, the owner of his parents’ farm noticed his mathematical ability
and arranged for him to move to London to work in a bank.</p>
<p>By age 20, he served at sea in the Royal Navy, teaching sailors
mathematics and helping with the ship’s navigation. On return to London
seven years later, he became a maths teacher in coffee houses and a
private tutor. In 1706, Jones published <em>Synopsis Palmariorum
Matheseos</em> which used the symbol <em>π</em> for the ratio of a
circle’s circumference to diameter (hunt for it on pages <a href="https://archive.org/details/SynopsisPalmariorumMatheseosOrANewIntroductionToTheMathematics/page/n261/mode/1up?view=theater">243</a>
and <a href="https://archive.org/details/SynopsisPalmariorumMatheseosOrANewIntroductionToTheMathematics/page/n283/mode/1up?view=theater">263</a>
or <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Synopsis_Palmariorum_Matheseos_pi.jpg">here</a>).
Jones was also the first person to realise <em>π</em> is an irrational
number, meaning it can be written as decimal number that goes on
forever, but cannot be written as a fraction of two integers.</p>
<p>But why <em>π</em>? It’s thought Jones used the Greek letter
<em>π</em> because it’s the first letter in <em>perimetron</em> or
perimeter. Jones was the first to use <em>π</em> as our familiar ratio
but wasn’t the first to use it in as part of the ratio. William
Oughtred, in his 1631 <em>Clavis Mathematicae</em> (<em>The Key of
Mathematics</em>), used <em>π/δ</em> to represent what we now call pi.
His <em>π</em> was the circumference, not the ratio of circumference to
diameter. James Gregory, in his 1668 <em>Geometriae Pars
Universalis</em> (<em>The Universal Part of Geometry</em>) used
<em>π/ρ</em> instead, where <em>ρ</em> is the radius, making the ratio
6.28… or <a href="https://www.tauday.com/"><em>τ</em></a>. After Jones,
Leonhard Euler had used <em>π</em> for 6.28…, and also <em>p</em> for
3.14…, before settling on and popularising <em>π</em> for the famous
ratio.</p>

<h3>CVE-2025-32873: Denial-of-service possibility in <tt class="docutils literal">strip_tags()</tt></h3>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">django.utils.html.strip_tags()</tt> would be slow to evaluate certain inputs
containing large sequences of incomplete HTML tags. This function is used to
implement the <tt class="docutils literal">striptags</tt> template filter, which was thus also vulnerable.
<tt class="docutils literal">django.utils.html.strip_tags()</tt> now raises a <tt class="docutils literal">SuspiciousOperation</tt>
exception if it encounters an unusually large number of unclosed opening tags.</p>
