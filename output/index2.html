<p>I’m Aayush Gauba, a Django developer and Djangonaut Space mentee passionate about open source security and AI integration in web systems. I’ve spoken at DjangoCon US and actively contribute to the Django community through projects like AIWAF. My focus is on using technology to build safer and more inclusive ecosystems for developers worldwide.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, I’ve contributed to multiple areas of technology ranging from web development and AI security to research in quantum inspired computing. I’ve presented talks across these domains, including at DjangoCon US, where I spoke about AI powered web security and community driven innovation.
Beyond Django, I’ve published academic papers exploring the intersection of ethics, quantum AI, and neural architecture design presented at IEEE and other research venues. These experiences have helped me understand both the technical and philosophical challenges of building responsible and transparent technology.
As a Djangonaut Space mentee, I’ve been on the learning side of Django’s mentorship process and have seen firsthand how inclusive guidance and collaboration can empower new contributors. I bring a perspective that connects deep research with community growth and balancing innovation with the values that make Django strong: openness, ethics, and accessibility.</p>
<p>As part of the DSF board, I would like to bridge the gap between experienced contributors and new voices. I believe mentorship and accessibility are key to Django’s future. I would also like to encourage discussions around responsible AI integration, web security, and community growth ensuring Django continues to lead both technically and ethically. My goal is to help the DSF stay forward looking while staying true to its open, supportive roots.</p>

When not writing code, I'm probably playing pinball, watching a movie, or shouting into the void on social media.</p>
<p>I have been working with Django in production for over 10 years at The Motley Fool where I am a Staff Engineer. I have also participated in the Djangonauts program for my Django Unicorn library, gave a talk at DjangoCon EU (virtual) and multiple lightning talks at DjangoCon US conferences, built multiple libraries for Django and Python, have a semi-regularly updated podcast about Django with my friend, Sangeeta,  and just generally try to push the Django ecosystem forward in positive ways.</p>
<p>The key issue I would like to get involved with is updating the djangoproject.com website. The homepage itself hasn't changed substantially in over 10 years and I think Django could benefit from a fresh approach to selling itself to developers who are interested in a robust, stable web framework. I created a forum post around this here: <a href="https://forum.djangoproject.com/t/want-to-work-on-a-homepage-site-redesign/42909" rel="ugc">Want to work on a homepage site redesign?</a>.

I have a PhD in Multisensory Perception. I make web apps and love combining new technologies. I’ve worked in academia (Sheffield, Dublin, Bangor, Manchester, Royal Holloway), industry (Unilever, NL), and founded three technology-based startups. I am proud of my neurodiversity.</p>
<p>I was on the review team of DjangoCon Europe 2021. I have had several blog posts included on the Django Newsletter (e.g. <a href="https://www.andytwoods.com/django-htmx-modal-popup-loveliness/" rel="ugc">django htmx modal popup loveliness</a>). I have written a scientific article on using Django for academic research (under peer review). I have several projects mentioned on <a href="https://djangopackages.org/" rel="ugc">Django Packages</a> e.g. <a href="https://github.com/andytwoods/mrbenn" rel="ugc">MrBenn Toolbar Plugin</a>. I am part of a cohort of people who regularly meet to discuss python based software they are developing in the context of startups, started by Michael Kennedy. Here is an example of an opensource django-based project I am developing there: <a href="https://www.tootology.com/">Tootology</a>.</p>
<p>I am keen on strengthening the link between Django and the academic community. Django has enormous potential as a research and teaching tool, but us academics don't know about this! I would like to make amends by advocating for members of our community to appear on academic podcasts and social media platforms to promote Django’s versatility, and to reach new audiences.</p>
<p>In my professional life, I lead work on Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion, and am committed to creating fair and supportive environments. I will bring this to the DSF. The Django community already takes great strides in this area, and I would like to build upon this progress. Python recently turning down a $1.5 million grant, which I feels exemplifies the awesomeness of the greater community we are a part of.</p></blockquote></details></section>

I actively organize and volunteer for community events around Django, Grafana, and Postgres. Professionally, I work as a software engineer at a startup, focusing on building scalable backend systems and developer tools. I’m also part of the Google Summer of Code working groups with Django and JdeRobot, contributing to mentorship and open source development for over four years.</p>
<p>I have been actively speaking at various tech communities including Python, FOSSASIA, Django, Grafana, and Postgres. Over time, I’ve gradually shifted from just speaking to also organizing and volunteering at these community events, helping others get involved and build connections around open source technologies.</p>
<p>Beyond work, I’ve been mentoring students through Google Summer of Code with Django and JdeRobot. I also teach high school students the fundamentals of Python, Django, and robotics, helping them build curiosity and confidence in programming from an early stage.</p>
<p>Last year, I joined the Accessibility Working Group of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which focuses on improving web accessibility standards and ensuring inclusive digital experiences for all users. My goal is to bring these learnings into the Django ecosystem, aligning its community and tools with global accessibility best practices.</p>
<p>Looking at the issues, I believe the opportunity of Google Summer of Code is currently very limited in Django. I know Django already has a lot of contributions, but being part of the core members in the JdeRobot organization, which is a small open source group, I understand the pain points we face when trying to reach that level of contribution. The way we utilize GSoC in JdeRobot has helped us grow, improve productivity, and bring in long-term contributors. I believe Django can benefit from adopting a similar approach.</p>
<p>Funding is another major issue faced by almost every open source organization. There are continuous needs around managing grants for conferences, supporting local communities and fellows, and sponsoring initiatives that strengthen the ecosystem. Finding sustainable ways to handle these challenges is something I want to focus on.</p>
<p>I also plan to promote Django across different open source programs. In my opinion, Django should not be limited to Python or Django-focused events. It can and should have a presence in database and infrastructure communities such as Postgres, Grafana, FOSSASIA, and W3C conferences around the world. This can help connect Django with new audiences and create more collaboration opportunities.</p></blockquote></details></section>

As a Microsoft MVP in the Developer Technologies category, an active DSF member and a leader in open source communities, I believe in the power of collaboration, documentation, and mentorship to unlock global impact.</p>
<p>My efforts focus on lowering the barriers to meaningful participation. My work sits at the intersection of production engineering, clear technical communication, and community building. I’ve spent years building ML production-ready systems with Django, FastAPI, Docker, cloud platforms, and also ensuring that the knowledge behind those systems is accessible to others. I’ve turned complex workflows into approachable, accessible guides and workshops that empower others to build confidently. I’ve also collaborated with global networks to promote ethical ML/AI and sustainable tech infrastructure in resource-constrained environments.</p>
<p>Through my extensive experience organizing major events like: DjangoCon Africa, UbuCon Africa, PyCon Africa, DjangoCon US, EuroPython, I’ve created inclusive spaces where underrepresented voices lead, thrive and are celebrated. This has equipped me with the skills and insights needed to drive inclusivity, sustainability and community engagement. I volunteer on both the DSF's CoC and the D&amp;I (as Chair) working groups.
I also contribute to the scientific community through projects like NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, the DISCOVER COOKBOOK (under NumFOCUS' DISC Program).</p>
<p>As the very first female Cameroonian to be awarded Microsoft MVP, this recognition reflects years of consistent contribution, technical excellence, and community impact. The program connects me with a global network that I actively leverage to bring visibility, resources, and opportunities back to Django and Python communities, bridging local initiatives with global platforms to amplify Django’s reach and relevance. It demonstrates that my work is recognized at the highest levels of the industry.</p>
<p>As a young Black African woman in STEM from a region of Africa with pretty limited resources and an active DSF member, I’ve dedicated my career to fostering inclusivity and representation in the tech and scientific spaces and I am confident that I bring a unique perspective to the table. </p>
<p>I will push the DSF to be more than a steward of code, to be a catalyst for global belonging. My priorities are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Radical inclusion: I'll work to expand resources and support for contributors from underrepresented regions, especially in Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia. This includes funding for local events, mentorship pipelines, and multilingual documentation sprints.</li>
<li>Sustainable community infrastructure: I’ll advocate for sustainable models of community leadership, ones that recognize invisible labor, prevent burnout, and promote distributed governance. We need to rethink how we support organizers, maintainers, and contributors beyond code.</li>
<li>Ethical tech advocacy: I’ll help the DSF navigate the ethical dimensions of Django’s growing role in AI and data-driven systems. From privacy to fairness, Django can lead by example. And I’ll work to ensure our framework reflects our values.</li>
<li>Global partnerships: I want to strengthen partnerships with regional communities and allied open-source foundations, ensuring Django’s growth is global and socially conscious. </li>
</ul>
<p>I will bring diversity, a young and energized spirit that I think most senior boards lack.
My vision is for the DSF to not only maintain Django but to set the standard for inclusive, ethical, and sustainable open source.
My goal is simple: to make Django the most welcoming, resilient, and socially conscious web framework in the world.</p></blockquote></details></section>

<p>I would want to get involved more on the community side, diversity in terms of regional presentation and awareness of Django, and the Django Software Foundation. In as much as they's a lot of efforts in place. With no available African entity of the DSF, this would make it difficult for companies/organization in Africa to donate and support the DSF, I would love to champion for that and pioner towards that direction, not only for Africa but also for other under-represented geographical areas.</p>
<p>I wasn't so sure about this last year, but I am more confident, with a better understanding of the Django ecosystem and I know I have the capabilities of getting more contributions to Django, both financially and code-wise. I would also love to make sure that Django and the ecosystem is well know through proper communication channels, I know this differs based on different countries, the goal is to make sure that the DSF is all over, of course, where we are needed.

I re-joined the DSF board in 2023, and have served as Treasurer since 2024. I used to be a software engineer and security consultant (REVSYS, Latacora, 18F, Heroku), before mostly retiring from tech in 2025 to become an EMT.</p>
<p>I've been a member of the DSF Board for 3 years, so I bring some institutional knowledge there. I've been involved in the broader Django community as long as there has been a Django community, though the level of my involvement has waxed and waned. The accomplishments I'm the most proud of in the Django community are creating our Code of Conduct (<a href="https://djangoproject.com/conduct/" rel="ugc">djangoproject.com/conduct/</a>), and more recently establishing the DSF's Working Groups model (<a href="https://github.com/django/dsf-working-groups/" rel="ugc">django/dsf-working-groups</a>).</p>
<p>Outside of the Django community, I have about 15 years of management experience, at companies small and large (and also in the US federal government).</p>
<p>I'm running for re-election with three goals for the DSF: (a) hire an Executive Director, (b) build more &quot;&quot;onramps&quot;&quot; into the DSF and Django community, and (c) expand and update our Grants program.</p>
<p>Hire an ED: this is my main goal for 2026, and the major reason I'm running for re-election. The DSF has grown past the point where being entirely volunteer-ran is working; we need transition the organization towards a more professional non-profit operation. Which means paid staff. Members of the Board worked on this all throughout 2025, mostly behind the scenes, and we're closer than ever -- but not quite there. We need to make this happen in 2026.</p>
<p>Build &quot;&quot;onramps&quot;&quot;: this was my main goal when I ran in 2024 (see my statement at <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2023/nov/13/2024-dsf-board-candidates/" rel="ugc">2024 DSF Board Candidates</a>). We've had some success there: several Working Groups are up and running, and over on the technical side we helped the Steering Council navigate a tricky transition, and they're now headed in a more positive direction. I'm happy with our success there, but there's still work to do; helping more people get involved with the DSF and Django would continue to be a high-level goal of mine. And, I'd like to build better systems for recognition of people who contribute to the DSF/Django — there are some incredible people working behind the scenes that most of the community has heard of.</p>
<p>Expand and update our grants program: our grants program is heavily overdue for a refresh. I'd like to update our rules and policies, make funding decisions clearer and less ad-hoc, increase the amount of money we're giving per grant, and (funding allowing) expand to to other kinds of grants (e.g. travel grants, feature grants, and more). I'd also like to explore turning over grant decisions to a Working Group (or subcommittee of the board), to free up Board time for more strategic work.</p></blockquote></details></section>

<p>I’m also an Individual Member of the Django Software Foundation, and my work continues to center on empowering developers, building open communities, and improving access for newcomers in tech.</p>
<p>As a board member, I want to help strengthen Django’s global community by improving accessibility, diversity, and engagement  especially across regions where Django adoption is growing but still lacks strong community infrastructure, such as Africa and other underrepresented areas.</p>
<p>My experience as Opportunity Grant Co-Chair for DjangoCon US and Design Lead for PyCon Africa has shown me how powerful community-driven support can be when it’s backed by inclusion and transparency. I want the DSF to continue building bridges between developers, organizers, and contributors  making sure that everyone, regardless of location or background, feels seen and supported.</p>
<p>I believe the DSF can take a more active role in empowering local communities, improving mentorship pathways, and creating better visibility for contributors who work behind the scenes. I also want to support initiatives that make Django more approachable to new developers through clearer learning materials and global outreach programs.</p>
<p>Personally, I want to help the DSF improve communication with international communities, expand partnerships with educational programs and tech organizations, and ensure the next generation of developers see Django as not just a framework, but a welcoming and sustainable ecosystem.</p>
<p>My direction for leadership is guided by collaboration, empathy, and practical action building on Django’s strong foundation while helping it evolve for the future</p></blockquote></details></section>

I work as a Software Engineer (Backend and DevOps) at a fintech startup and love volunteering in community spaces. From leading student communities as a GitHub Campus Expert to contributing as a GitHub Octern and supporting initiatives in the Django ecosystem, open-source is an integral part of my journey as a developer.</p>
<p>My belonging to the Django community has been shaped by serving as the Session Organizer of the global <a href="https://djangonaut.space/" rel="ugc">Djangonaut Space</a> program, where I work closely with contributors and mentors from diverse geographies, cultures, age groups, and both coding and non-coding backgrounds.

As we enter the execution phase, we are focused on establishing additional long-term funding streams for the DSF. I intend to continue this work by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Running sustained fundraising campaigns rather than one-off appeals</li>
<li>Building corporate sponsorship relationships for major donations</li>
<li>Focusing on the funding of the Executive Director for financial resilience</li>
</ul>
<p>My commitment to a supportive ecosystem guides my work. I am a strong advocate of psychological safety in open-source, a topic I've publicly talked about (“<a href="https://priyapahwa.com/posts/culture-eats-strategy-for-breakfast/" rel="ugc">Culture Eats Strategy for Breakfast</a>” at PyCon Greece and DjangoCongress Japan). This belief led me to join the <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/teams/#code-of-conduct-team" rel="ugc">DSF Code of Conduct Working Group</a> because the health of a community is determined not only by who joins, but by who feels able to stay.</p>
<p>If elected to the board, I will focus on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Moving fundraising WG from “effort” to infrastructure (already moving in the direction by forming the DSF prospectus)</li>
<li>Initiating conference travel grants to lower barriers and increase participation for active community members</li>
<li>Strengthening cross-functional working groups' collaboration to reduce organizational silos</li>
<li>Designing inclusive contributor lifecycles to support pauses for caregiving or career breaks</li>
<li>Highlighting diverse user stories and clearer “here’s how to get involved” community pathways</li>
<li>Amplifying DSF’s public presence and impact through digital marketing strategies </li>

<p>Beyond code, I’ve supported newcomers through docs-first guidance, small PR reviews, and patient issue triage. I’m a CPython bug triager and listed in Mozilla credits, which taught me to balance openness with careful review and clear process. I’ve collaborated across India, UK, and Canada, so I’m used to async work, time-zones, and transparent communication.</p>
<p>I owe my learnings to the community and want to give back. I understand the DSF Board is non-technical leadership like fundraising, grants/sponsorships, community programs, CoC support, and stewardship of Django’s operations and not deciding framework features. That’s exactly where I want to contribute.</p>
<p>I’ll push for an easy, skimmable annual “Where your donation went” report (fellows, events, grants, infra) plus lightweight quarterly updates. Clear storytelling helps retain individual and corporate sponsors and shows impact beyond core commits.</p>
<p>I want to grow contributors globally by turning their first PR into regular contributions. I want to make this path smoother by funding micro-grants for mentorship/sprints and backing working groups with small, delegated budgets under clear guardrails - so they can move fast without waiting on the Board.</p>
<p>I propose a ready-to-use “starter kit” for meetups/sprints: budget templates, venue ask letters, CoC, diversity travel-grant boilerplates, and a sponsor prospectus. We should prioritize regions with high Django usage but fewer historic DSF touchpoints (South Asia, Africa, LATAM). This comes directly from organizing over 120 meetups and annual conference like PyCon India for 3 years.</p></blockquote></details></section>

            <p>I play Pikmin Bloom regularly with a group of friends. The game
can be best described as “Pokémon Go, but walking”. One of
the main goals of the game is to collect “<a href="https://www.pikminwiki.com/Decor_Pikmin">decor Pikmin</a>” which can
come from the environment, landmarks, and businesses that you walk by.
Recently there's been a change to the game that makes completing sets
of decor Pikmin <strong>significantly more difficult</strong>, this post
explores the new difficulty increase.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Every month there are <a href="https://www.pikminwiki.com/Special_Decor_Pikmin">special decor Pikmin</a> which are earned by completing
challenges like walking, growing Pikmin, or planting flowers. The type of Pikmin
you receive is randomized between the available types, and you can only complete
the set by collecting one of <a href="https://www.pikminwiki.com/Pikmin_family">each available Pikmin type</a>. You can only
receive these special decors during the specific month, after the month is
over you have to wait a calendar year before you can continue collecting seedlings.</p>

<p>Just a few days ago there were 7 Pikmin types corresponding to the
first three mainline Pikmin games: Red, Yellow, Blue, White, Purple, Rock, and Wing Pikmin.
With the most recent update another Pikmin type has been added: <a href="https://pikminbloom.com/en/news/nov25-icepikmin-welcome">Ice Pikmin from Pikmin 4</a>.
This means that going forward there will be 8 Pikmin types per event decor set
instead of only 7.</p>

<p><strong>So, what does that mean for the difficulty of the game?</strong>
I could probably do some math here, but it'd be much easier to simulate how
many event Pikmin you'd need to receive before completing the set depending
on if there are 7 or 8 total Pikmin types.</p>

<p>Running this <a href="https://gist.github.com/sethmlarson/e0ec72671b2362d9da4090121750179e">Python simulation script</a> creates the below table which shows the difference in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_distribution_function">cumulative
probability</a> for completing a decor set after receiving a number of Pikmin seedlings. For example,
if you have grown 10 seedlings you'd have a <strong>10.5% chance</strong> of completing the decor set
<strong>before Ice Pikmin</strong> and only a <strong>2.8% chance</strong> of completing the decor set <strong>after Ice Pikmin</strong>.</p>

<p>For mid-range numbers of Pikmin seedlings (13-22)
you'll be at <strong>least 15% less likely</strong> to have completed the Pikmin decor set
for that number of seedlings. To have a 95% chance of completing a decor set
you'd need to gather 32 seedlings prior to Ice Pikmin, with Ice Pikmin you'd
need to collect 38 seedlings.</p>

<p>I don't know how many event Pikmin seedlings I receive in a typical month,
I'll be watching that number and see if I'm able to complete the set. Good luck out there, Pikmin players! 😬</p>

    <h2>How are class attributes stored by default?</h2>
    
      
        <p>Here we have a class called <code>Point</code> in a <code>points.py</code> file:</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Point</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="fm">__init__</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">z</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">y</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">z</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">z</span><span class="p">)</span>


<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">point_path_from_file</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">filename</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">with</span> <span class="nb">open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">filename</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">lines</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="p">[</span>
            <span class="n">Point</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="nb">map</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">float</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">point_line</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">split</span><span class="p">()))</span>
            <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">point_line</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">lines</span>
        <span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>And here's an instance of this <code>Point</code> class:</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">p</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Point</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>Normally, classes store their attributes in a <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/using-dictionaries-in-python/" target="_blank">dictionary</a> called <code>__dict__</code>.</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">p</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="vm">__dict__</span>
<span class="go">{'x': 1, 'y': 2, 'z': 3}</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>We have a class here where every instance has <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>z</code> attributes.
But we could add other attributes to any instance of this <code>Point</code> class, and another key-value pair will appear in this <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/where-are-attributes-stored/" target="_blank"><code>__dict__</code></a> dictionary.</p>

      
        <p>For example if we add a <code>w</code> attribute:</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">p</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">w</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">4</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>Our <code>__dict__</code> dictionary will now have a <code>w</code> attribute:</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">p</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="vm">__dict__</span>
<span class="go">{'x': 1, 'y': 2, 'z': 3, 'w': 4}</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>This is how classes work <em>by default</em>; classes work this way <strong>unless you use <code>__slots__</code></strong>.</p>

            <p>As the PSF heads into our end-of-year fundraiser, we want to share information to help “connect the dots” and show a more complete picture of the PSF’s current financial outlook. You’ve heard from us on subjects related to our financial position from several different angles recently (a list of those posts is below). We’ve prioritized proactive communications, because we believe in transparency, we have trust in our community, and we value keeping you informed— we know how invested in and impacted by our work you are. We now want to pull those threads together in order to create some shared clarity on the big picture, and, hopefully, inspire you to action to support our fundraising efforts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">The dots</h2><p>Many groups, organizers, and individuals in the Python community and beyond are experiencing the impacts of the current financial environment, including inflation, reduced sponsorship, economic pressure in the tech sector, and global/local uncertainty and conflict. Unfortunately, the PSF has felt these effects as well, in a number of ways. We’ve been doing our best to share how the current environment impacts our areas of service to the community as the PSF navigates these challenges over the past couple of years:<br /></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li><a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/12/psf-grants-program-charter-updates-tldr.html" target="_blank">PSF Grants Program Changes</a></li><li><a href="https://pycon.blogspot.com/2024/11/important-changes-ahead-commitment-to.html" target="_blank">PyCon US 2025 Financial Transparency</a></li><li><a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2025/08/the-psf-has-paused-our-grants-program.html" target="_blank">PSF Grants Program Pause</a></li><li><a href="https://openssf.org/blog/2025/09/23/open-infrastructure-is-not-free-a-joint-statement-on-sustainable-stewardship/" target="_blank">Open Infrastructure is not Free Joint Statement&nbsp;</a></li><li><a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2025/10/open-infrastructure-is-not-free-pypi.html" target="_blank">Our post on the Open Infrastructure is Not Free</a></li><li><a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2025/10/NSF-funding-statement.html" target="_blank">NSF Grant Application Withdrawal</a></li></ul><p>To briefly summarize, the PSF’s assets and yearly revenue have declined, and costs have increased, while the demand and need for our work has continued to multiply.&nbsp;<br /><br />Historically, PyCon US has been a source of revenue for the PSF, enabling us to fund programs like our currently paused <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/grants/" target="_blank">Grants Program</a>. A PSF-run PyCon US is also an essential program for the PSF to deliver value to our sponsors. Unfortunately, PyCon US has run at a loss for three years—and not from a lack of effort from our staff and volunteers! Everyone has been working very hard to find areas where we can trim costs, but even with those efforts, inflation continues to surge, and changing US and economic conditions have reduced our attendance. Because PyCon US is still a 2000+ person event, we must secure venue contracts for event spaces that can accommodate that number of people, years in advance. Those contracts come with a lot of requirements, such as union labor, required vendors, and many more details (iykyk) that, in the end, amount to a hefty spend.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Python usage has continued to surge (which is wonderful!), but rather than keep pace, corporate investment back into the language and the community has declined overall. The PSF has longstanding sponsors and partners that we are ever grateful for, but signing on new corporate sponsors has slowed. We have been seeking out alternate revenue channels to diversify our income, with some success and some challenges. <a href="https://docs.pypi.org/organization-accounts/pricing-and-payments/" target="_blank">PyPI Organizations offers paid features to companies</a> (PyPI features are always free to community groups) and has begun bringing in monthly income.&nbsp;<br /><br />We’ve also been seeking out grant opportunities where we find good fits with our mission. We made it far along in one large U.S. Government grant process, but <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2025/10/NSF-funding-statement.html" target="_blank">ultimately decided to withdraw our application because it conflicted with our values and mission</a>. The community's supportive response to that decision has been heartening and brought in an unexpected surge of material support totaling $135K+ USD from 1400+ donors, which includes 270+ new PSF members! The PSF is astounded and deeply appreciative at the outpouring of solidarity in both words and actions. This remarkable show of support reminds the us of the community’s strength, and reinforces our resolve in the decision to withdraw from the grant process, even as the $1.5M gap from the grant remains.<br /><br />Our <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/annual-report/2024/" target="_blank">2024 Annual Impact Report</a> provides a window on the current economic outlook for the PSF, with a loss in net income and a dip in the growth of assets in 2024. Because we have so few expense categories (the vast majority of our spending goes to running PyCon US, the Grants Program, and our small 13-member staff), we have limited “levers to pull” when it comes to budgeting and long-term sustainability. As you can see from the categories mentioned, each of these expense areas leads directly to the services we provide the community. Additionally, we have several sources of assets with donor restrictions (i.e. earmarked funds), meaning we can’t shift those funds to cover other areas of need.&nbsp;</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiZPIx4i6NVY6f8AVHYRfZ94Tk5-dQRuVfT9G4f7ca2Os8q9d5qVbpdfR362immobVURI1JvV8ivZUpeO8owWUZUJ1TWL7FbS5quiYak-mQwN1UrtyU1U6By56QcKoDAiKHQvkjlvWa1MLXD4KNC0-dr_5aFBiex6DgEubx5FNP98iH3RQcSQ/s1056/PYTHON_annual_report_2024_digital-1.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="309" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiZPIx4i6NVY6f8AVHYRfZ94Tk5-dQRuVfT9G4f7ca2Os8q9d5qVbpdfR362immobVURI1JvV8ivZUpeO8owWUZUJ1TWL7FbS5quiYak-mQwN1UrtyU1U6By56QcKoDAiKHQvkjlvWa1MLXD4KNC0-dr_5aFBiex6DgEubx5FNP98iH3RQcSQ/w400-h309/PYTHON_annual_report_2024_digital-1.png" width="400" /></a></div><br />&nbsp;<p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">What does this mean?&nbsp;</h2><p>Overall, the PSF is facing significant financial challenges, but we are actively monitoring the situation and taking action where we can. This post is our way of “raising the flag” early and calling in the community proactively. We currently have more than six months of runway (as opposed to our preferred 12 months+ of runway), so the PSF is not at immediate risk of having to make more dramatic changes, but we are on track to face difficult decisions if the situation doesn’t shift in the next year.&nbsp;</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">What we’re doing</h2>Based on all of this, the PSF has been making changes and working on multiple fronts to combat losses and work to ensure financial sustainability, in order to continue protecting and serving the community in the long term. Some of these changes and efforts include:<br /><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Pursuing new sponsors, specifically in the AI industry and the security sector</li><li>Increasing sponsorship package pricing to match inflation</li><li>Making adjustments to reduce PyCon US expenses</li><li>Pursuing funding opportunities in the US and Europe</li><li>Working with other organizations to raise awareness</li><li>Strategic planning, to ensure we are maximizing our impact for the community while cultivating mission-aligned revenue channels</li></ul>The PSF’s end-of-year fundraiser effort is usually run by staff based on their capacity, but this year we have assembled a fundraising team that includes Board members to put some more “oomph” behind the campaign. We’ll be doing our regular fundraising activities; we’ll also be creating a unique webpage, piloting temporary and VERY visible pop-ups to python.org and PyPI.org, and telling more stories from our Grants Program recipients.&nbsp;<br /><h2 style="text-align: left;">What you can do</h2><b>So, what can you do to help us gain sponsors to ensure critical infrastructure, our community, and more can stay supported and sustainable?</b><br /><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>If your company is using Python to build its products and services, check to see if they already sponsor the PSF on our <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/sponsors/" target="_blank">Sponsors page</a>.</li><li>If not, reach out to your organization's internal decision-makers and impress on them just how important it is for us to power the future of Python together, and send them <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/prospectus2026/" target="_blank">our sponsor prospectus</a>.</li><li>Point out the various benefits they will receive from sponsoring the PSF. Mention that <a href="https://us.pycon.org/" target="_blank">PyCon US 2026</a> is coming up next spring, where they can connect with the community, recruit, and understand the current direction of the Python language!</li><li>Remind them to reach out to sponsors@python.org if they have any questions or would like a walk-through of our sponsorship program.</li></ol>As the PSF prepares for our end-of-year fundraiser, we want to emphasize the importance of our community's support. Your relentless passion for Python and our community, along with your individual donations, memberships, stories, advocacy, and more, all make a huge impact and keep our tiny-but-mighty PSF team inspired. Keep your eyes on the <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">PSF Blog</a>, the <a href="https://discuss.python.org/c/python-software-foundation/9" target="_blank">PSF category on Discuss</a>, and <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2025/02/where-is-psf-2025-edition.html" target="_blank">our social media accounts</a> for updates and information as we kick off the fundraiser this month. Your boosts of our posts and your personal shares of “why I support the PSF” stories will make all the difference in our end-of-year fundraiser.&nbsp;<br /><br />If this post has you all fired up to personally support the future of Python and the PSF <b><i>right now</i></b>, we always welcome new <a href="https://psfmember.org/civicrm/contribute/transact/?reset=1&amp;id=1" target="_blank">PSF Supporting Members</a> and <a href="https://psfmember.org/civicrm/contribute/transact/?reset=1&amp;id=2" target="_blank">donations</a>.

            <p>If you're into GameCube collecting and archiving you may already know
that GameCube ISOs or "ROMs" are around ~1.3 GB in size, regardless of
the game that is contained within the <code>.iso</code> file. This is because
GameCube ROMs are all copies of the same disk format: the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_optical_discs#GameCube_Game_Disc">GameCube Game disc</a> (DOL-6).</p>

<p>The GameCube Game disc is a 8cm
miniDVD-based disc with a static storage capacity of 1.5 GB. Compare this to cartridges which using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_management_controller_(Nintendo)">memory-mapping controllers (MMC)</a> can
encase different amounts of storage ROM depending on the size of the game data itself.</p>

and the size of the GameCube game library (&gt;650 total, 45 first-party) meant storage requirements could increase quickly for new GameCube titles.</p>

<p>Luckily, looking at the data about the GameCube Nintendo Classics application on the Switch we can see that
the ROMs in use are "trimmed", such that their size is less than 1.3 GB:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
  <th>Date</th>
  <th>Titles</th>
  <th style="text-align: center;">Games</th>

<tbody>

  <td>F-Zero GX<br />Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker<br />Soulcalibur II</td>
  <td style="text-align: center;">3</td>
  <td style="text-align: right;">3.5 GB</td>
  <td style="text-align: right;">1.16 GB</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>2025-07-03</td>
  <td>Super Mario Strikers</td>
  <td style="text-align: center;">4</td>
  <td style="text-align: right;">??? GB</td>
  <td style="text-align: right;">??? GB</td>

<tr>
  <td>2025-08-21</td>
  <td>Chibi-Robo!</td>
  <td style="text-align: center;">5</td>
  <td style="text-align: right;">6.9 GB</td>
  <td style="text-align: right;">1.38 GB</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>2025-10-30</td>
  <td>Luigi's Mansion</td>
  <td style="text-align: center;">6</td>
  <td style="text-align: right;">7.2 GB</td>
  <td style="text-align: right;">1.2 GB</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>Luigi's Mansion in particular is known to only require ~100 MB of data on the 1.3 GB disc. Animal Crossing
for the GameCube is also legendarily small due to starting life as an N64 game, requiring only 50 MB of data.</p>

<p>It'll be interesting to see what happens for the first <a href="https://gamicus.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_multi-disc_GameCube_games">multi-disc game</a> to be added
to Nintendo Classics. Notably, Namco already has a GameCube game in Nintendo Classics: Soulcalibur II.
For this reason, I suspect that the first multi-disc game will be one of these
three published by Namco:</p>

<ul>
<li>Baten Kaitos Origins</li>
<li>Baten Kaitos: Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean</li>
<li>Tales of Symphonia</li>

            >
          </h2>
          
        </div>

        <!-- Content Section -->
        <div class="p-4 flex-grow overflow-hidden">
          <p class="text-base-content">
            <p>It&#8217;s probably no surprise to you that we&#8217;re building
<a href="https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents">agents</a>
somewhere.  Everybody does it.  Building a good agent, however, brings back
some of the historic challenges involving durable execution.</p>
<p>Entirely unsurprisingly, a lot of people are now building durable execution
systems.  Many of these, however, are incredibly complex and require you to
sign up for another third-party service.  I generally try to avoid bringing in
extra complexity if I can avoid it, so I wanted to see how far I can go with
just Postgres.  To this end, I wrote
<a href="https://github.com/earendil-works/absurd">Absurd</a> <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>, a tiny SQL-only
library with a very thin SDK to enable durable workflows on top of just
Postgres — no extension needed.</p>
<h2>Durable Execution 101</h2>
<p>Durable execution (or durable workflows) is a way to run long-lived, reliable
functions that can survive crashes, restarts, and network failures without losing
state or duplicating work.  Durable execution can be thought of as the combination
of a queue system and a state store that remembers the most recently seen execution state.</p>
<p>Because Postgres <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190530143429/https://www.2ndquadrant.com/en/blog/what-is-select-skip-locked-for-in-postgresql-9-5/">is excellent at
queues</a>
thanks to <code>SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED</code>, you can use it for the queue (e.g.,
with <a href="https://github.com/pgmq/pgmq">pgmq</a>).  And because it&#8217;s a database, you
can also use it to store the state.</p>
<p>The state is important.  With durable execution, instead of running your logic in
memory, the goal is to decompose a task into smaller pieces (step functions) and
record every step and decision.  When the process stops (whether it fails,
intentionally suspends, or a machine dies) the engine can replay those events to
restore the exact state and continue where it left off, as if nothing happened.</p>
<h2>Absurd At A High Level</h2>
<p>Absurd at the core is a single <code>.sql</code> file
(<a href="https://github.com/earendil-works/absurd/blob/main/sql/absurd.sql"><code>absurd.sql</code></a>)
which needs to be applied to a database of your choice.  That SQL file&#8217;s goal is
to move the complexity of SDKs into the database.  SDKs then make the
system convenient by abstracting the low-level operations in a way that
leverages the ergonomics of the language you are working with.</p>
<p>The system is very simple: A <em>task</em> dispatches onto a given <em>queue</em> from where
a <em>worker</em> picks it up to work on.  Tasks are subdivided into <em>steps</em>, which are
executed in sequence by the worker.  Tasks can be suspended or fail, and when
that happens, they execute again (a <em>run</em>).  The result of a step is stored in
the database (a <em>checkpoint</em>).  To avoid repeating work, checkpoints are
automatically loaded from the state storage in Postgres again.</p>
<p>Additionally, tasks can <em>sleep</em> or <em>suspend for events</em> and wait until they are
emitted.  Events are cached, which means they are race-free.</p>
<h2>With Agents</h2>
<p>What is the relationship of agents with workflows?  Normally, workflows are DAGs
defined by a human ahead of time.  AI agents, on the other hand, define their own
adventure as they go.  That means they are basically a workflow with
mostly a single step that iterates over changing state until it determines that
it has completed.  Absurd enables this by automatically counting up steps if they
are repeated:</p>

<p>This defines a single task named <code>my-agent</code>, and it has just a single step.  The
return value is the changed state, but the current state is passed in as an
argument.  Every time the step function is executed, the data is looked up first
from the checkpoint store.  The first checkpoint will be <code>iteration</code>, the second
<code>iteration#2</code>, <code>iteration#3</code>, etc.  Each state only stores the new messages it
generated, not the entire message history.</p>
<p>If a step fails, the task fails and will be retried.  And because of checkpoint
storage, if you crash in step 5, the first 4 steps will be loaded automatically
from the store.  Steps are never retried, only tasks.</p>
<p>How do you kick it off? Simply enqueue it:</p>

<h2>That&#8217;s it!</h2>
<p>Really, that&#8217;s it.  There is really not much to it.  It&#8217;s just a queue and a
state store — that&#8217;s all you need.  There is <a href="https://useworkflow.dev/">no compiler
plugin</a> and no <a href="https://www.inngest.com/">separate
service</a> or <a href="https://temporal.io/">whole runtime
integration</a>.  Just Postgres.  That&#8217;s not to throw shade
on these other solutions; they are great.  But not every problem necessarily
needs to scale to that level of complexity, and you can get quite far with much
less.  Particularly if you want to build software that other people should be
able to self-host, that might be quite appealing.</p>

            Today, we’re talking about building real AI products with foundation models. Not toy demos, not vibes. We’ll get into the boring dashboards that save launches, evals that change your mind, and the shift from analyst to AI app builder. Our guide is Hugo Bowne-Anderson, educator, podcaster, and data scientist, who’s been in the trenches from scalable Python to LLM apps. If you care about shipping LLM features without burning the house down, stick around.

<p>Usually we would release the new Tryton version 7.8 in November, but this time we <a href="https://discuss.tryton.org/t/postpone-the-release-of-series-7-8-by-one-month/8899">postpone the release</a>. In the last month we focused on fixing bugs, improving the behaviour of things, speeding-up performance issues - building on the changes from <a href="https://discuss.tryton.org/t/tryton-release-7-2/">our last release</a>. We also added some new features which we would like to introduce to you in this newsletter.</p>

            <p>It's November! Many folks use this month to write
more, whether it's a <a href="https://nanowrimo.org">novel</a> or <a href="https://nanogenmo.github.io/">generating text</a>.
I'm going to be trying to write and share more often, too.</p>

<p>So here's something I created for mostly me, but maybe you too.
I've <a href="https://github.com/sethmlarson/nintendo-classics">created a small RSS feed</a> for new games being added to the
<a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/online/nintendo-switch-online/classic-games/">Nintendo Classics collection</a> over time. Nintendo uses this
collection as the drippiest-of-drip-feeds, so there's typically
only a few new games per month. So instead of checking
frequently I can follow this feed in my <a href="https://inoreader.com">feed reader</a>
and be notified on new releases.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>I thought this was interesting for a few reasons, one I implemented
“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_comma">Oxford commas</a>” when joining a <code>list[str]</code> using f-strings like so, split apart for easier reading:</p>

<div class="codehilite">
<pre><span></span><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">oxford_comma</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">list</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">])</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="p">(</span>
        <span class="sa">f</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="si">{</span><span class="s1">', '</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">join</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">[:</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">])</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span>
        <span class="sa">f</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="si">{</span><span class="s1">','</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="nb">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">&gt;=</span> <span class="mi">3</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="s1">''</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span> <span class="c1"># Oxford comma!</span>
        <span class="sa">f</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="si">{</span><span class="s1">' and '</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="nb">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">&gt;=</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="s1">''</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span>
        <span class="sa">f</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="si">{</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span>  <span class="c1"># Last or only element.</span>
    <span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>I'm sure this could be done in less space somehow, if you're able
to code-golf this smaller please <a href="mailto:sethmichaellarson@gmail.com">send me your code</a> :)</p>

<p>Second interesting thing about the RSS feed is there's only one <code>&lt;item&gt;</code> or entry
in the feed at any one time. I suppose I could have implemented the latest N new groups
of releases, but I felt that wouldn't be useful for me who was already caught up
on what has been released in the past month or so.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, my feed reader had no issue with a single entry feed on the first crawl, but I've never
seen this in the wild so it'll be interesting to see how the reader reacts to
a new entry replacing the old one.</p>
<br /><hr /><p>Thanks for keeping RSS alive! ♥</p>
