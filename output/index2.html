            <blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> The original version of this article was slightly different, e.g. with 500x speedup; I reworked it to make the argument clearer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If your Python code is slow and needs to be <em>fast</em>, there are many
different approaches you can take, from parallelism to writing a
compiled extension. But if you just stick to one approach, it’s easy to
miss potential speedups, and end up with code that is much slower than
it could be.</p>

<p>To make sure you’re not forgetting potential sources of speed, it’s
useful to think in terms of <em>practices</em>. Each practice:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Speeds up your code in its own unique way.</li>
  <li>Involves distinct skills and knowledge.</li>
  <li>Can be applied on its own.</li>
  <li>Can also be applied together with other practices for even more
speed.</li>
</ul>

<p>To make this more concrete, in this article I’ll work through an example
where I will apply multiple practices. Specifically I’ll be
demonstrating the practices of:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Getting rid of wasteful or repetitive calculations.</li>
  <li><strong>Compilation:</strong> Using a compiled language, and potentially working around the
compiler’s limitations.</li>
  <li><strong>Parallelism:</strong> Using multiple CPU cores.</li>
  <li><strong>Process:</strong> Using development processes that result in faster code.</li>
</ol>

<p>We’ll see that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Applying just the Practice of Efficiency to this problem gave me an
almost 2× speed-up.</li>
  <li>Applying just the Practice of Compilation gave me a 10× speed-up.</li>
  <li>When I applied both, the result was even faster.</li>
  <li>Following up with the Practice of Parallelism gave even more of a
speedup, for a final speed up of 330×.</li>
</ul>

<p>To understand why security is special, we have to take a look at why open source is an amazing thing.
For many components of open source, users that have the time, desire, and expertise are able to contribute meaningfully to projects.
As a maintainer of an open source project, <em>this is awesome!</em></p>

<p><center><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/sethmlarson-dev-static-assets/Screenshot%20from%202025-07-02%2015-17-21.png" style="border: 2px black solid;" /></center></p>

<p>Users and contributors can work on the areas they are interested in, like triaging bug reports, engaging with the community, or writing great docs.
For smaller open source projects this is especially important, there’s only one or a few maintainers and they can’t do it all on their own sustainably.</p>

<p>But not for security, right? Security is <em>special</em>.</p>

<p><center><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/sethmlarson-dev-static-assets/Screenshot%20from%202025-07-02%2015-17-28.png" style="border: 2px black solid;" /></center></p>

<p>Only a select few are supposed to be able to handle vulnerability reports, configure the repository and package manager settings, and secure the release process.
This tight association between security work and maintainers is what I’d like to try to pull apart today.</p>

<p>Maintainers, especially for smaller projects, are almost always experts in the <em>domain of the project</em>, not necessarily in <em>security</em>.
But the expectations of open source projects means that maintainers feel compelled to do this work to keep their project and users safe.</p>

<p>And those expectations for security today, that <strong>security work is done by few rather than many</strong>, combined with the secretive nature of security work means that maintainers often feel isolated.</p>

<p>Maintainers don’t see how other projects are triaging vulnerabilities and can’t learn from each other. They can’t compare notes on what they are seeing and whether they are doing the right thing.
Isolation in security work breeds a culture of fear. Fear of doing the wrong thing and making your users unsafe.</p>

<p><center><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/sethmlarson-dev-static-assets/Screenshot%20from%202025-07-02%2015-17-34.png" style="border: 2px black solid;" /></center></p>

<p>This private conversation was published with permission from Marcelo, maintainer of <a href="https://github.com/encode/starlette">Starlette</a>, a popular Python library that powers FastAPI.</p>

<p>He was seeing security reports that seemed convincing but they were also confusing. He asked for my help and together we determined the reports were generated with an LLM and were meaningless. I later published an article about “<a href="https://sethmlarson.dev/slop-security-reports">slop security reports</a>” that other projects were seeing too, including curl, Python, Django, and others. But none of us would know what the others were seeing without sharing.</p>

<p><center><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/sethmlarson-dev-static-assets/Screenshot%20from%202025-07-02%2015-17-40.png" style="border: 2px black solid;" /></center></p>

<p>Smaller projects are shaped by their tools, not the other way around.
Small projects don’t have the time and resources to make a square peg fit into a circular hole when it comes to any type of tooling, including security.
They don’t have time to create bots and wrappers and bend these tools to work for them, like many larger projects do.</p>

<p>This means that whatever is available or the default experience is probably what they work with, and often our tools encode the assumption that “only maintainers do security work”.</p>

<p>Of the top 10,000 open source packages with GitHub repositories identified by <a href="https://ecosyste.ms/">Ecosystems dataset</a>, 35% are owned by a GitHub user, not a GitHub organization.
This has huge implications for what features are available to those projects and who is able to do security work at all.</p>

<p><center><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/sethmlarson-dev-static-assets/Screenshot%20from%202025-07-02%2015-17-46.png" style="border: 2px black solid;" /></center></p>

<p>Security tools and vulnerability reports often introduce an asymmetry by creating work to do without resolving the issues identified.
Fixing security issues while weighing user expectations, performance, and backwards compatibility is a tough job.
This is the reason maintainers are often hesitant to adopt security scanners and tools, because adoption is easy but being on the hook to triage the findings forever is hard.</p>

<p>If a bunch of your limited time with a project is spent doing work that isn’t aligned with your interests in the project, this can lead to burnout which only makes the problem worse.</p>

<p>This image is from the changelog of <a href="https://libexpat.github.io">libexpat</a> which states that the project is understaffed and without funding and is in need of help responding to findings from fuzzing the project within the standard 90 day grace period.</p>

<p>So what can we all do to make security work less “special” and more like other open source contributions?</p>

<p><center><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/sethmlarson-dev-static-assets/IMG_2325.JPG" style="border: 2px black solid;" /></center></p>

<p>I propose a new model for open source security contributions, where security work is completed by trusted individuals that aren’t necessarily maintainers on behalf of projects.
This model break the assumption that maintainers are the only ones that can do security work, especially for smaller projects.</p>

<p>These “security contributors” could be maintainers or contributors of other open source projects that know about security, they could be foundations offering up resources to their ecosystem, or engineers at companies helping their dependency graph.</p>

<p>Even if you’re not contributing security work directly to an open source project, I think there’s reframing, re-engineering, and rethinking work that we can all do to make this model successful.</p>

<p>Now I know what you might be thinking: “What about XZ?”
XZ often comes up during conversations involving trust in contributors to open source projects, but I’m not convinced it’s the show-stopper it’s often portrayed as.</p>

<p><center><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/sethmlarson-dev-static-assets/Screenshot%20from%202025-07-02%2015-18-34.png" style="border: 2px black solid;" /></center></p>

<p>The technologies to discover the backdoor trigger of XZ already exist but had not yet been adopted by the project, such as reproducible builds, build provenance, capability analysis, or using a canonical URL to download source code.</p>

<p>Malicious contributors have always been a problem for open source and the solution can’t be that we just stop trusting each other or accepting help from our community.
We lose something bigger than the XZ-utils backdoor if we let this incident define how open source security works going forward.</p>

<p>We have to be able to build trust amongst contributors and projects and security work can’t all fall on maintainers.
If we want <em>open source sustainability</em> then we cannot let XZ-utils define open source security.</p>

<p><center><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/sethmlarson-dev-static-assets/Screenshot%20from%202025-07-02%2015-18-25.png" style="border: 2px black solid;" /></center></p>

<p>So what can we all do to nurture this more sustainable model of open source security contribution?</p>

<p>We can all use our voices and experiences to build a more positive and healthy security culture and overcome the isolation inherent to security work.</p>

<p><center><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/sethmlarson-dev-static-assets/Screenshot%20from%202025-07-02%2015-18-40.png" style="border: 2px black solid;" /></center></p>

<p>Sharing and encouraging the sharing experiences shows others that they’re not the only ones that think this is difficult.
Seeing others sharing experiences shows that it’s okay to ask for help and to not be perfect, instead the focus should be on always improving.</p>

<p><center><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/sethmlarson-dev-static-assets/Screenshot%20from%202025-07-02%2015-18-46.png" style="border: 2px black solid;" /></center></p>

<p>If you’re a public contributor to open source security, making yourself visible and approachable is a great way to begin building trust in the communities you participate in.
Conferences and in-person meetups are excellent venues for promoting positive security culture and building trust amongst a community.</p>

<p>There is something about being in-person that really let’s people be vulnerable and talk honestly about what they are experiencing and their problems which sometimes is exactly what we need to hear.
When I’m at conferences I also like to offer up 1-on-1 time to discuss security issues with maintainers or help them adopt new security features.</p>

<p><center><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/sethmlarson-dev-static-assets/Screenshot%20from%202025-07-02%2015-18-51.png" style="border: 2px black solid;" /></center></p>

<p>TLS and public key infrastructure scale trust of the internet and web, we need more technologies that scale trust in open source contributions.</p>

<p>We should continue contributing to and adopting technologies that enable trust for open source projects and contributions.
This is especially meaningful when the technology is added to existing tooling like package managers and build tools.
Technologies like build reproducibility, build provenance, and capability analysis can all minimize the risk from adding more privileged contributors.</p>

<p><center><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/sethmlarson-dev-static-assets/Screenshot%20from%202025-07-02%2015-19-03.png" style="border: 2px black solid;" /></center></p>

<p>We  need platforms and tools to update their underlying assumptions about who does security work for projects to support this new open source security contribution model.</p>

<p>Separating maintenance responsibilities and security work is beneficial for users wanting to help projects, too.
If we assume that the securing and maintaining are linked, then it becomes a more difficult task to be able to offer help to open source projects.
Some projects do not have the governance in place to transition from one to many maintainers. Some maintainers want to continue owning the project roadmap and vision.</p>

<p>Getting your manager on-board with you maintaining a project is a difficult and amorphous ask compared to more tightly defined “security work” for an open source dependency your team uses.
Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs) could use this model to concretely show how they are benefiting their whole open source supply-chain, and not only the larger projects that are able to receive grant funding.</p>

<p>I don’t think this change happens overnight, but we need to think about where we might go.
From my experience working in open source, security work isn’t the special sauce, it’s always trust.</p>

<p>Whether you’re an open source user, a contributor to OpenSSF or other security working groups, or a developer of tools for open source projects, I hope I’ve inspired you that we need to think beyond current models of how security work is done for open source projects to achieve sustainable open source security.</p>

<p>In the last month we focused on fixing bugs, improving the behaviour of things, speeding-up performance issues - building on the changes from <a href="https://discuss.tryton.org/t/tryton-release-7-2/">our last release</a>. We also added some new features which we would like to introduce to you in this newsletter.</p>
<p>For an in depth overview of the <a href="https://bugs.tryton.org/">Tryton issues please take a look at our issue tracker </a> or see the issues and merge requests <a href="https://code.tryton.org/tryton/-/labels">filtered by label</a>.</p>
<h2 id="heading--user">Changes for the User</h2>
<h3 id="heading--accounting">Accounting, Invoicing and Payments</h3>
<p>Now <a href="https://code.tryton.org/tryton/-/commit/7b7b59f44c28efe4f41788be259da300028850d3">we provide a dedicated <em>list view</em> to display the children lines on budget forms</a>.<br />
As we do not need the full record name but just the current name when editing a child from its parent form.</p>
<h3 id="heading--ui">User Interface</h3>
<p>We now <a href="https://bugs.tryton.org/14084">converted <em>Unidentified Image Errors</em> into more user friendly validation errors</a>. The normalisation/preprocess of images using <em>PIL</em> (Python Image Library) may raise these exceptions.</p>
<p><a href="https://bugs.tryton.org/14048">Now we keep selected rows on <code>xxx2Many</code> widget on reload</a>.</p>
<p>We now <a href="https://bugs.tryton.org/14063">limit the height of the completion drop downs</a> and the actions are set <em>sticky</em> to be always visible.</p>
<h3 id="heading--system-data-config">System Data and Configuration</h3>
<p>In order to have always the same results no matter of the order of the lines, <a href="https://bugs.tryton.org/14047">we now round the tax amount of each line before adding it to the total tax</a>.<br />
In the past we rounded the tax amount per line after it was added to the total tax. With the used <em>bankers rounding</em> the issue is that when the result is like <code>.xy5</code> (if rounding precision is set to 2 digits) it may be rounded up or down depending if the <code>y</code>-digit is even or odd.</p>
<h2 id="heading--new-releases">New Releases</h2>
<p>We released bug fixes for the currently maintained <a href="https://discuss.tryton.org/t/release-process/395">long term support series</a><br />
<a href="https://code.tryton.org/tryton/-/commits/branch/7.0">7.0</a> and <a href="https://code.tryton.org/tryton/-/commits/branch/6.0">6.0</a>, and for the penultimate series <a href="https://code.tryton.org/tryton/-/commits/branch/7.6">7.6</a>, <a href="https://code.tryton.org/tryton/-/commits/branch/7.4">7.4</a> and <a href="https://code.tryton.org/tryton/-/commits/branch/7.2">7.2</a>.</p>

        <div class="p-4 flex-grow overflow-hidden">

            <p>I really like QR codes. Recently I purchased a new sticky-note-like
pad from a <a href="https://www.moonamoono.com/">new local stationery store in Minneapolis</a>.
The sheets have a 10x10 grid and 2x10 grid.</p>

<p><center><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/sethmlarson-dev-static-assets/IMG_2362.jpg" style="border: 2px black solid;" /></center></p>

<p>I knew what I wanted to do, I wanted to create a QR code on a sheet.
The smallest QR code (besides micro QR codes) is "version 1" which uses 21x21 pixels.
We'll have to split the squares in half and then use some of the margin.</p>

<p>Version 1 QR codes can hold URLs up to 17 bytes long using the lowest
data quality setting. Unfortunately <code>https://sethmlarson.dev</code> is 23 bytes
long, so I'll have to improvise. I went with <code>sethmlarson.dev</code> instead, as this
will prompt many QR code scanners to "search" for the term resulting in my website.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note that a lovely reader <a href="https://mastodon.social/@joshix@fosspri.de/114778118868222197">informed me</a> shortly after publication that indeed
  I can include my full domain name in a version 1 QR code by using all capital
  letters instead of lowercase. TIL that the "alphanumeric" character set for QR
  codes actually contains symbols for URLs like <code>:</code> and <code>/</code>.</p>
  
  <p>Expect an updated QR code published after lunch today. :)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I created my reference using the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/qrcode/"><code>qrcode</code> package</a> on the Python Package Index. Don't forget
the <code>-n</code> option with <code>echo</code> to not include a trailing newline.</p>

<pre><code>$ echo -n "HTTPS://SETHMLARSON.DEV" | qr --error-correction=L
</code></pre>

<p>I drew the corner squares (known as "position patterns") and then started trying
to scan the QR code as a gradually filled in other pixels. Once I had drawn the
"timing lines" between the top left and bottom left position I could
see that my scanner "wanted" to see something in my drawing.</p>

<p><center><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/sethmlarson-dev-static-assets/IMG_2355.jpg" style="border: 2px black solid;" /></center></p>

<p>I continued adding the top timing line and data and then the scanner could
start to see the whole square as a QR code. If you look closely I even
made a mistake here in the data a bit, but in the end this didn't matter
even on the lowest error-correction level.</p>

<p><center><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/sethmlarson-dev-static-assets/IMG_2356.jpg" style="border: 2px black solid;" /></center></p>

<p>Finally, my QR code was complete! Scanning the QR code was quite finicky because
the paper was curling up off the flat surface. I could only get the scan to work
when I held the paper flat. However, hanging the QR code from my monitor worked
extremely well, even when scanning from a distance.</p>

<p><center><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/sethmlarson-dev-static-assets/IMG_2367.jpg" style="border: 2px black solid;" /></center></p>

<p>I hope this inspires you to try hand-drawing something on grid paper 🖤🤍

<h3 id="مقدمة-الفصل"><strong>مقدمة الفصل</strong></h3>

<p>لقد وصلت إلى المحطة النهائية والأكثر أهمية في رحلتك التعليمية. هذا الفصل هو تتويج لكل ما تعلمته. سنقوم هنا بجمع كل المهارات التي اكتسبتها—من المتغيرات والدوال، إلى القوائم والقواميس، وصولًا إلى البرمجة كائنية التوجه والتعامل مع الملفات—لبناء مشروع حقيقي ومتكامل من الألف إلى الياء.</p>

<p>مشروعنا سيكون <strong>تطبيقًا لإدارة المهام (To-Do List)</strong> يعمل من سطر الأوامر. من خلال بنائه، ستتعلم كيف يفكر المبرمجون المحترفون عند تحويل فكرة إلى منتج عملي.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="1-التخطيط-للمشروع"><strong>1. التخطيط للمشروع</strong></h2>

<p>قبل كتابة أي سطر برمجي، يجب أن نخطط. التخطيط الجيد هو نصف العمل.</p>

<h3 id="أ-ميزات-التطبيق-ماذا-سيفعل"><strong>أ. ميزات التطبيق (ماذا سيفعل؟)</strong></h3>

<p>تطبيقنا يجب أن يسمح للمستخدم بالقيام بالوظائف الأساسية التالية:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>عرض</strong> جميع المهام الحالية.</li>
  <li><strong>إضافة</strong> مهمة جديدة.</li>
  <li><strong>تحديث</strong> مهمة معينة واعتبارها “مُنجزة”.</li>
  <li><strong>حذف</strong> مهمة من القائمة.</li>
  <li><strong>حفظ</strong> المهام بشكل دائم بحيث لا تُفقد عند إغلاق التطبيق.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="ب-هيكل-المشروع-كيف-سننظمه"><strong>ب. هيكل المشروع (كيف سننظمه؟)</strong></h3>

<p>لتطبيق مبادئ التنظيم التي تعلمناها، لن نضع كل الكود في ملف واحد. بدلاً من ذلك، سنقسم المشروع إلى ثلاثة ملفات (وحدات)، كل ملف له مسؤولية محددة وواضحة:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>todo_project/
│
├── main.py         # (الملف الرئيسي): مسؤول عن الواجهة والتفاعل مع المستخدم.
├── task.py         # (وحدة المهمة): يحتوي على "مخطط" أو كلاس المهمة.
└── storage.py      # (وحدة التخزين): مسؤولة عن حفظ واسترجاع المهام من ملف.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>هذا التقسيم يجعل مشروعنا نظيفًا، سهل الفهم، وقابلاً للتطوير في المستقبل.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="2-بناء-المشروع-خطوة-بخطوة"><strong>2. بناء المشروع خطوة بخطوة</strong></h2>

<h3 id="الجزء-الأول-بناء-مخطط-المهمة-ملف-taskpy"><strong>الجزء الأول: بناء “مخطط” المهمة (ملف <code class="highlighter-rouge">task.py</code>)</strong></h3>

<p>سنبدأ بتصميم “قلب” تطبيقنا، وهو كلاس <code class="highlighter-rouge">Task</code>. هذا الكلاس سيمثل كل مهمة على حدة، وسيحتوي على كل البيانات (الخصائص) والأفعال (الدوال) المتعلقة بها.</p>

<p><strong>الآن، في مجلد مشروعك، أنشئ ملفًا جديدًا باسم <code class="highlighter-rouge">task.py</code> واتبع الخطوات التالية:</strong></p>

<p><strong>1. استيراد وحدة <code class="highlighter-rouge">datetime</code></strong>
نحتاج إلى تسجيل وقت وتاريخ إنشاء كل مهمة. أفضل أداة لهذا هي وحدة <code class="highlighter-rouge">datetime</code> من مكتبة بايثون القياسية.</p>

<p>اكتب السطر التالي في ملف <code class="highlighter-rouge">task.py</code>:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">datetime</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>2. تعريف كلاس <code class="highlighter-rouge">Task</code></strong>
سنقوم الآن بإنشاء المخطط (الكلاس) الذي سيتم استخدامه لإنشاء كل مهمة في تطبيقنا.</p>

<p>أضف السطر التالي:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Task</span><span class="p">:</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>3. بناء المُنشئ (دالة <code class="highlighter-rouge">__init__</code>)</strong>
المُنشئ هو دالة خاصة تعمل تلقائيًا في كل مرة ننشئ فيها مهمة جديدة. وظيفتها هي تهيئة الخصائص الأولية للمهمة، مثل عنوانها وحالتها.</p>

<p>أضف الأسطر التالية داخل كلاس <code class="highlighter-rouge">Task</code> (تذكر المسافة البادئة):</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">__init__</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">title</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">is_done</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="bp">False</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">title</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">title</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">is_done</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">is_done</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">created_at</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">datetime</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">datetime</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">now</span><span class="p">()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>شرح هذه الجزئية بالتفصيل:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">def __init__(self, title, is_done=False):</code></strong>: هذا هو تعريف المُنشئ.
    <ul>
      <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">self</code> تشير إلى المهمة (الكائن) نفسها التي يتم إنشاؤها.</li>
      <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">title</code> هو عنوان المهمة الذي يجب أن نزوده به عند إنشائها.</li>
      <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">is_done=False</code> يعني أن أي مهمة جديدة ستكون حالتها “غير منجزة” بشكل افتراضي.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">self.title = title</code></strong>: هذا السطر يقوم بإنشاء خاصية اسمها <code class="highlighter-rouge">title</code> داخل الكائن ويخزن فيها قيمة العنوان الذي تم تمريره.</li>
  <li><strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">self.is_done = is_done</code></strong>: يقوم بإنشاء خاصية <code class="highlighter-rouge">is_done</code> ويخزن فيها الحالة.</li>
  <li><strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">self.created_at = datetime.datetime.now()</code></strong>: يقوم بإنشاء خاصية <code class="highlighter-rouge">created_at</code> ويسجل فيها الوقت والتاريخ الحاليين بالضبط عند إنشاء المهمة.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>4. إضافة دالة لتحديث حالة المهمة</strong>
نحتاج إلى طريقة لتغيير حالة المهمة من “غير منجزة” إلى “منجزة”. سنفعل ذلك عبر دالة (method) داخل الكلاس.</p>

<p>أضف الأسطر التالية داخل كلاس <code class="highlighter-rouge">Task</code>:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">mark_as_done</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">is_done</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">True</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>شرح هذه الجزئية:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">mark_as_done</code> هي دالة بسيطة جدًا، كل ما تفعله هو تغيير قيمة الخاصية <code class="highlighter-rouge">is_done</code> إلى <code class="highlighter-rouge">True</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>5. تحديد كيفية طباعة المهمة (دالة <code class="highlighter-rouge">__str__</code>)</strong>
إذا حاولنا طباعة كائن المهمة مباشرة (<code class="highlighter-rouge">print(my_task)</code>), سيعرض بايثون شيئًا غير مفهوم. دالة <code class="highlighter-rouge">__str__</code> الخاصة تسمح لنا بتحديد الشكل النصي الذي نريده للمهمة عند طباعتها.</p>

<p>أضف الأسطر التالية داخل كلاس <code class="highlighter-rouge">Task</code>:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">__str__</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="n">status_icon</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">"✅"</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">is_done</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="s">"🔘"</span>
        <span class="n">formatted_date</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">created_at</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">strftime</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"%Y-%m-%d"</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="sa">f</span><span class="s">"[</span><span class="si">{</span><span class="n">status_icon</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s">] </span><span class="si">{</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">title</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s"> (Added: </span><span class="si">{</span><span class="n">formatted_date</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s">)"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>شرح هذه الجزئية:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">status_icon = "✅" if self.is_done else "🔘"</code>: هذا تعبير ثلاثي. إذا كانت المهمة منجزة (<code class="highlighter-rouge">is_done</code> هو <code class="highlighter-rouge">True</code>)، ستكون الأيقونة ✅. وإلا، ستكون 🔘.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">formatted_date = self.created_at.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")</code>: نستخدم دالة <code class="highlighter-rouge">strftime</code> لتنسيق التاريخ وعرضه بشكل مقروء.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">return f"..."</code>: نعيد نصًا منسقًا يجمع كل المعلومات معًا بشكل أنيق.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>الكود الكامل لملف <code class="highlighter-rouge">task.py</code></strong>
بعد اتباع كل الخطوات السابقة، يجب أن يبدو ملف <code class="highlighter-rouge">task.py</code> الخاص بك هكذا:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># This is the complete code for: task.py

<h3 id="الجزء-الثاني-بناء-وحدة-التخزين-ملف-storagepy"><strong>الجزء الثاني: بناء وحدة التخزين (ملف <code class="highlighter-rouge">storage.py</code>)</strong></h3>

<p>هذه الوحدة ستكون مسؤولة عن حفظ واسترجاع قائمة مهامنا من وإلى ملف على القرص الصلب. سنستخدم تنسيق JSON لأنه سهل القراءة والكتابة في بايثون.</p>

<p><strong>الآن، أنشئ ملفًا جديدًا باسم <code class="highlighter-rouge">storage.py</code> واتبع الخطوات التالية:</strong></p>

<p><strong>1. استيراد الوحدات اللازمة</strong>
سنحتاج إلى وحدة <code class="highlighter-rouge">json</code> للتعامل مع البيانات بصيغة JSON، وسنحتاج إلى استيراد كلاس <code class="highlighter-rouge">Task</code> من ملف <code class="highlighter-rouge">task.py</code> الذي أنشأناه للتو.</p>

<p>اكتب الأسطر التالية في ملف <code class="highlighter-rouge">storage.py</code>:</p>

<p><strong>شرح هذه الجزئية:</strong>
نحتاج إلى <code class="highlighter-rouge">datetime</code> أيضًا هنا لأننا سنتعامل مع تواريخ عند قراءة البيانات من الملف.</p>

<p><strong>2. تحديد اسم ملف التخزين</strong>
من الجيد دائمًا وضع اسم الملف في متغير ثابت في أعلى الملف لتسهيل تغييره لاحقًا إذا أردنا.</p>

<p>أضف السطر التالي:</p>

<p><strong>3. بناء دالة <code class="highlighter-rouge">save_tasks</code></strong>
هذه الدالة ستحول قائمة كائنات <code class="highlighter-rouge">Task</code> إلى صيغة يمكن حفظها في ملف JSON.</p>

<ul>
  <li>لا يمكن لـ JSON حفظ كائنات بايثون مباشرة. لذلك، نحن بحاجة لتحويل كل كائن <code class="highlighter-rouge">task</code> إلى قاموس <code class="highlighter-rouge">dict</code> بسيط.</li>
  <li>داخل الحلقة، ننشئ قاموسًا لكل مهمة. لاحظ أننا نحول التاريخ إلى نص باستخدام <code class="highlighter-rouge">isoformat</code>، لأن كائنات <code class="highlighter-rouge">datetime</code> لا يمكن حفظها مباشرة.</li>
  <li>في النهاية، نستخدم <code class="highlighter-rouge">json.dump</code> لحفظ قائمة القواميس في الملف. <code class="highlighter-rouge">indent=4</code> تجعل الملف منظمًا وسهل القراءة للإنسان.</li>

<p><strong>4. بناء دالة <code class="highlighter-rouge">load_tasks</code></strong>

<h3 id="الجزء-الثالث-بناء-الواجهة-الرئيسية-ملف-mainpy"><strong>الجزء الثالث: بناء الواجهة الرئيسية (ملف <code class="highlighter-rouge">main.py</code>)</strong></h3>

<p>هذا هو الملف الذي سيقوم المستخدم بتشغيله. إنه يجمع كل الأجزاء معًا.</p>

<p><strong>الآن، أنشئ ملفًا جديدًا باسم <code class="highlighter-rouge">main.py</code> واتبع الخطوات التالية:</strong></p>

<p><strong>1. استيراد الأدوات اللازمة</strong>
سنحتاج إلى استيراد الدوال من <code class="highlighter-rouge">storage.py</code> وكلاس <code class="highlighter-rouge">Task</code> من <code class="highlighter-rouge">task.py</code>.</p>

<p>اكتب الأسطر التالية في ملف <code class="highlighter-rouge">main.py</code>:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">storage</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">save_tasks</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">load_tasks</span>
<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">task</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">Task</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>2. بناء دالة لعرض القائمة الرئيسية</strong>
من الجيد دائمًا وضع الكود الذي يتكرر، مثل عرض القائمة، في دالة خاصة به.</p>

<p>أضف الأسطر التالية:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">show_menu</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s">--- To-Do List Application ---"</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"1. View all tasks"</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"2. Add a new task"</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"3. Mark a task as done"</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"4. Delete a task"</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"5. Exit"</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>3. بناء الدالة الرئيسية <code class="highlighter-rouge">main</code></strong>
هذه هي الدالة التي ستحتوي على المنطق الرئيسي للتطبيق.</p>

<p>أضف الأسطر التالية:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">main</span><span class="p">():</span>

</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>شرح هذه الجزئية:</strong></p>

  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">while True:</code>: نستخدم حلقة لا نهائية لإبقاء البرنامج يعمل ويعرض القائمة بشكل مستمر حتى يختار المستخدم الخروج.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>شرح هذه الجزئية:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>عرض المهام (<code class="highlighter-rouge">choice == '1'</code>)</strong>: يتحقق أولاً مما إذا كانت القائمة فارغة. إذا لم تكن كذلك، فإنه يستخدم <code class="highlighter-rouge">enumerate</code> لعرض المهام مرقمة.</li>
  <li><strong>إضافة مهمة (<code class="highlighter-rouge">choice == '2'</code>)</strong>: يطلب عنوانًا، ينشئ كائن <code class="highlighter-rouge">Task</code> جديدًا، يضيفه إلى القائمة، ثم يستدعي فورًا <code class="highlighter-rouge">save_tasks</code> لحفظ التغيير.</li>
  <li><strong>تحديث وحذف (<code class="highlighter-rouge">choice == '3'</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">'4'</code>)</strong>: يطلبان رقم المهمة. لاحظ أننا نستخدم <code class="highlighter-rouge">task_num - 1</code> للوصول إلى الفهرس الصحيح في القائمة (لأن المستخدم يرى الأرقام من 1، بينما الفهرسة تبدأ من 0). ثم يقومان بالتعديل أو الحذف، ويحفظان التغييرات.</li>
  <li><strong>الخروج (<code class="highlighter-rouge">choice == '5'</code>)</strong>: يستخدم <code class="highlighter-rouge">break</code> لكسر حلقة <code class="highlighter-rouge">while</code> وإنهاء البرنامج.</li>

<p><strong>5. تشغيل الدالة الرئيسية</strong>
أخيرًا، نحتاج إلى سطر يخبر بايثون ببدء تشغيل دالة <code class="highlighter-rouge">main</code> عند تنفيذ الملف.</p>

<h3 id="مقدمة-الفصل"><strong>مقدمة الفصل</strong></h3>

<p>عندما تعمل على مشاريع صغيرة، قد يكون من المقبول كتابة كل الكود في ملف واحد. لكن مع نمو المشروع وزيادة تعقيده، يصبح هذا الأسلوب كابوسًا. سيصعب عليك العثور على أجزاء معينة من الكود، وستزداد احتمالية حدوث أخطاء، وستكون عملية الصيانة والتطوير شبه مستحيلة.</p>

<p>لهذا السبب، يستخدم المبرمجون المحترفون تقنيات لتنظيم مشاريعهم وتقسيمها إلى أجزاء أصغر وأكثر قابلية للإدارة. في هذا الفصل، سنتعلم أهم طريقتين لتنظيم الكود في بايثون:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>الوحدات (Modules):</strong> لتقسيم الكود إلى ملفات منفصلة.</li>
  <li><strong>الحزم (Packages):</strong> لتجميع الوحدات المترابطة معًا في مجلدات.</li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h2 id="1-ما-هي-الوحدة-module"><strong>1. ما هي الوحدة (Module)؟</strong></h2>

<p>في أبسط صورها، <strong>الوحدة هي أي ملف بايثون بامتداد <code class="highlighter-rouge">.py</code></strong>. عندما تقوم بإنشاء دالة أو كلاس في ملف، يمكنك “استيراد” هذه الوحدة في ملف آخر واستخدام ما بداخلها. هذا يسمح لك بتقسيم منطق برنامجك إلى ملفات متعددة، كل ملف مسؤول عن مهمة محددة.</p>

<h3 id="كيفية-إنشاء-واستخدام-وحدة"><strong>كيفية إنشاء واستخدام وحدة</strong></h3>

<p><strong>الخطوة الأولى: إنشاء الوحدة</strong>
لنفترض أننا نعمل على برنامج يتطلب عمليات حسابية متكررة. بدلاً من كتابة هذه الدوال في ملفنا الرئيسي، سنقوم بإنشاء وحدة خاصة بها.</p>

<p>أنشئ ملفًا جديدًا باسم <code class="highlighter-rouge">math_operations.py</code> واكتب بداخله الكود التالي:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># module math_operations.py
</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">add</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="s">"""This function adds two numbers."""</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">y</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">subtract</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="s">"""This function subtracts two numbers."""</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">y</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>شرح هذه الجزئية:</strong>
لقد أنشأنا الآن وحدة اسمها <code class="highlighter-rouge">math_operations</code>. تحتوي على دالتين بسيطتين. لاحظ أننا أضفنا نصًا توضيحيًا (docstring) داخل كل دالة، وهي ممارسة جيدة لتوثيق الكود.</p>

<p><strong>الخطوة الثانية: استيراد الوحدة في ملف آخر</strong>
الآن، أنشئ ملفًا آخر في <strong>نفس المجلد</strong> باسم <code class="highlighter-rouge">main.py</code>. هذا سيكون برنامجنا الرئيسي. لاستخدام الدوال التي أنشأناها، سنقوم باستيراد الوحدة <code class="highlighter-rouge">math_operations</code>.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># this is main.py
</span>
<span class="c1"># We import the entire module

</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>شرح هذه الجزئية:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">import math_operations</code></strong>: هذا السطر يخبر بايثون بأننا نريد استخدام الكود الموجود في ملف <code class="highlighter-rouge">math_operations.py</code>.</li>
  <li><strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">math_operations.add(...)</code></strong>: للوصول إلى دالة داخل وحدة مستوردة، نكتب اسم الوحدة، متبوعًا بنقطة (<code class="highlighter-rouge">.</code>)، ثم اسم الدالة. هذا يمنع تضارب الأسماء إذا كانت لديك دالة بنفس الاسم في ملفك الرئيسي.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="طرق-أخرى-للاستيراد"><strong>طرق أخرى للاستيراد</strong></h3>

<p>في بعض الأحيان، قد ترغب في استيراد دالة معينة فقط، أو إعطاء الوحدة اسمًا مختصرًا.</p>

<p><strong>استيراد دالة محددة باستخدام <code class="highlighter-rouge">from</code>:</strong></p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># Import only the 'add' function from the module
</span><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">math_operations</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">add</span>

<span class="c1"># Now we can use the function directly without the module name
</span><span class="n">result</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">add</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">20</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">7</span><span class="p">)</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>إعطاء اسم مستعار للوحدة باستخدام <code class="highlighter-rouge">as</code>:</strong>
هذا مفيد جدًا مع الوحدات ذات الأسماء الطويلة.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># Import the module with a shorter alias 'mo'
</span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">math_operations</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">mo</span>

<h2 id="2-ما-هي-الحزمة-package"><strong>2. ما هي الحزمة (Package)؟</strong></h2>

<p>عندما يصبح مشروعك كبيرًا جدًا ويحتوي على عشرات الوحدات، فإن وضعها كلها في مجلد واحد يصبح فوضويًا. <strong>الحزمة هي طريقة لتنظيم الوحدات المترابطة معًا داخل مجلد</strong>.</p>

<p>ببساطة، <strong>الحزمة هي أي مجلد يحتوي على ملف خاص باسم <code class="highlighter-rouge">__init__.py</code></strong>.</p>

<p>وجود هذا الملف (حتى لو كان فارغًا) يخبر بايثون بأن هذا المجلد ليس مجرد مجلد عادي، بل هو حزمة يمكن استيراد الوحدات منها.</p>

<h3 id="هيكل-مشروع-يستخدم-الحزم"><strong>هيكل مشروع يستخدم الحزم</strong></h3>

<p>لنتخيل أننا نوسع مشروع الآلة الحاسبة ليشمل عمليات حسابية بسيطة وأخرى معقدة. يمكننا تنظيم المشروع على النحو التالي:</p>

<h3 id="مقدمة-الفصل"><strong>مقدمة الفصل</strong></h3>

<p>عندما تعمل على مشاريع صغيرة، قد يكون من المقبول كتابة كل الكود في ملف واحد. لكن مع نمو المشروع وزيادة تعقيده، يصبح هذا الأسلوب كابوسًا. سيصعب عليك العثور على أجزاء معينة من الكود، وستزداد احتمالية حدوث أخطاء، وستكون عملية الصيانة والتطوير شبه مستحيلة.</p>

<p>لهذا السبب، يستخدم المبرمجون المحترفون تقنيات لتنظيم مشاريعهم وتقسيمها إلى أجزاء أصغر وأكثر قابلية للإدارة. في هذا الفصل، سنتعلم أهم طريقتين لتنظيم الكود في بايثون:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>الوحدات (Modules):</strong> لتقسيم الكود إلى ملفات منفصلة.</li>
  <li><strong>الحزم (Packages):</strong> لتجميع الوحدات المترابطة معًا في مجلدات.</li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h2 id="1-ما-هي-الوحدة-module"><strong>1. ما هي الوحدة (Module)؟</strong></h2>

<p>في أبسط صورها، <strong>الوحدة هي أي ملف بايثون بامتداد <code class="highlighter-rouge">.py</code></strong>. عندما تقوم بإنشاء دالة أو كلاس في ملف، يمكنك “استيراد” هذه الوحدة في ملف آخر واستخدام ما بداخلها. هذا يسمح لك بتقسيم منطق برنامجك إلى ملفات متعددة، كل ملف مسؤول عن مهمة محددة.</p>

<h3 id="كيفية-إنشاء-واستخدام-وحدة"><strong>كيفية إنشاء واستخدام وحدة</strong></h3>

<p><strong>الخطوة الأولى: إنشاء الوحدة</strong>
لنفترض أننا نعمل على برنامج يتطلب عمليات حسابية متكررة. بدلاً من كتابة هذه الدوال في ملفنا الرئيسي، سنقوم بإنشاء وحدة خاصة بها.</p>

<p>أنشئ ملفًا جديدًا باسم <code class="highlighter-rouge">math_operations.py</code> واكتب بداخله الكود التالي:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># This is our module: math_operations.py
</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">add</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="s">"""This function adds two numbers."""</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">y</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">subtract</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="s">"""This function subtracts two numbers."""</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">y</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>شرح هذه الجزئية:</strong>
لقد أنشأنا الآن وحدة اسمها <code class="highlighter-rouge">math_operations</code>. تحتوي على دالتين بسيطتين. لاحظ أننا أضفنا نصًا توضيحيًا (docstring) داخل كل دالة، وهي ممارسة جيدة لتوثيق الكود.</p>

<p><strong>الخطوة الثانية: استيراد الوحدة في ملف آخر</strong>
الآن، أنشئ ملفًا آخر في <strong>نفس المجلد</strong> باسم <code class="highlighter-rouge">main.py</code>. هذا سيكون برنامجنا الرئيسي. لاستخدام الدوال التي أنشأناها، سنقوم باستيراد الوحدة <code class="highlighter-rouge">math_operations</code>.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># This is our main program: main.py
</span>
<span class="c1"># We import the entire module

</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>شرح هذه الجزئية:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">import math_operations</code></strong>: هذا السطر يخبر بايثون بأننا نريد استخدام الكود الموجود في ملف <code class="highlighter-rouge">math_operations.py</code>.</li>
  <li><strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">math_operations.add(...)</code></strong>: للوصول إلى دالة داخل وحدة مستوردة، نكتب اسم الوحدة، متبوعًا بنقطة (<code class="highlighter-rouge">.</code>)، ثم اسم الدالة. هذا يمنع تضارب الأسماء إذا كانت لديك دالة بنفس الاسم في ملفك الرئيسي.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="طرق-أخرى-للاستيراد"><strong>طرق أخرى للاستيراد</strong></h3>

<p>في بعض الأحيان، قد ترغب في استيراد دالة معينة فقط، أو إعطاء الوحدة اسمًا مختصرًا.</p>

<p><strong>استيراد دالة محددة باستخدام <code class="highlighter-rouge">from</code>:</strong></p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># Import only the 'add' function from the module
</span><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">math_operations</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">add</span>

<span class="c1"># Now we can use the function directly without the module name
</span><span class="n">result</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">add</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">20</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">7</span><span class="p">)</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>إعطاء اسم مستعار للوحدة باستخدام <code class="highlighter-rouge">as</code>:</strong>
هذا مفيد جدًا مع الوحدات ذات الأسماء الطويلة.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># Import the module with a shorter alias 'mo'

<h2 id="2-ما-هي-الحزمة-package"><strong>2. ما هي الحزمة (Package)؟</strong></h2>

<p>عندما يصبح مشروعك كبيرًا جدًا ويحتوي على عشرات الوحدات، فإن وضعها كلها في مجلد واحد يصبح فوضويًا. <strong>الحزمة هي طريقة لتنظيم الوحدات المترابطة معًا داخل مجلد</strong>.</p>

<p>ببساطة، <strong>الحزمة هي أي مجلد يحتوي على ملف خاص باسم <code class="highlighter-rouge">__init__.py</code></strong>.</p>

<p>وجود هذا الملف (حتى لو كان فارغًا) يخبر بايثون بأن هذا المجلد ليس مجرد مجلد عادي، بل هو حزمة يمكن استيراد الوحدات منها.</p>

<h3 id="هيكل-مشروع-يستخدم-الحزم"><strong>هيكل مشروع يستخدم الحزم</strong></h3>

<p>لنتخيل أننا نوسع مشروع الآلة الحاسبة ليشمل عمليات حسابية بسيطة وأخرى معقدة. يمكننا تنظيم المشروع على النحو التالي:</p>

            <h1 id="الفصل-الثاني-عشر-المكتبات-الخارجية-والبيئات-الافتراضية"><strong>الفصل الثاني عشر: المكتبات الخارجية والبيئات الافتراضية</strong></h1>

<h3 id="مقدمة-الفصل"><strong>مقدمة الفصل</strong></h3>

<p>لقد استكشفنا في الفصل السابق الأدوات القوية التي تأتي مدمجة مع بايثون في مكتبتها القياسية. الآن، حان الوقت لفتح الباب أمام القوة الحقيقية لمجتمع بايثون: <strong>النظام البيئي الهائل للمكتبات الخارجية (External Libraries)</strong>. هذه المكتبات هي التي تجعل من بايثون اللغة الأولى في مجالات مثل علم البيانات والذكاء الاصطناعي وتطوير الويب.</p>

<p>لكن قبل أن نبدأ بتثبيت هذه الأدوات، يجب أن نتعلم أولاً كيف نحافظ على تنظيم مشاريعنا. عندما تعمل على مشاريع مختلفة، قد يحتاج كل مشروع إلى إصدارات مختلفة من نفس المكتبة. فكيف نمنع حدوث تضارب بينها؟ الحل يكمن في <strong>البيئات الافتراضية (Virtual Environments)</strong>.</p>

<p>في هذا الفصل، سنتعلم الممارسة الاحترافية لإدارة المشاريع:</p>

<ol>
  <li>إنشاء بيئات معزولة لكل مشروع.</li>
  <li>استخدام مدير الحزم <code class="highlighter-rouge">pip</code> لتثبيت المكتبات داخل هذه البيئات.</li>
  <li>استكشاف بعض المكتبات الخارجية التي ستغير طريقة برمجتك.</li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h2 id="1-البيئات-الافتراضية-تنظيم-مساحة-عملك"><strong>1. البيئات الافتراضية: تنظيم مساحة عملك</strong></h2>

<p>تخيل أنك تعمل على مشروعين:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>المشروع أ:</strong> يتطلب مكتبة تحليل بيانات بالإصدار 1.0.</li>
  <li><strong>المشروع ب:</strong> هو مشروع أحدث ويتطلب نفس المكتبة ولكن بالإصدار 2.0.</li>
</ul>

<p>إذا قمت بتثبيت المكتبات على نظامك مباشرة، فستواجه مشكلة. لا يمكنك تثبيت إصدارين مختلفين من نفس المكتبة في نفس الوقت. هذا ما يسمى بـ “جحيم الاعتماديات” (Dependency Hell).</p>

<p><strong>الحل هو البيئة الافتراضية.</strong> البيئة الافتراضية هي نسخة معزولة ومستقلة من بايثون ومكتباتها، خاصة بمشروع واحد فقط. عندما تنشئ بيئة افتراضية لمشروعك، فإن أي مكتبة تقوم بتثبيتها ستكون موجودة فقط داخل هذه البيئة، ولن تؤثر على مشاريعك الأخرى أو على بايثون المثبت على نظامك.</p>

<p><strong>إنها أفضل ممارسة يجب على كل مبرمج بايثون اتباعها.</strong></p>

<h3 id="كيفية-إنشاء-وتفعيل-بيئة-افتراضية"><strong>كيفية إنشاء وتفعيل بيئة افتراضية</strong></h3>

<p>تحتوي بايثون على وحدة مدمجة اسمها <code class="highlighter-rouge">venv</code> لإنشاء البيئات الافتراضية.</p>

<p>أولاً، سنقوم بإنشاء البيئة. افتح سطر الأوامر (Terminal أو Command Prompt)، اذهب إلى مجلد مشروعك، ثم نفذ الأمر التالي لإنشاء مجلد بيئة افتراضية باسم <code class="highlighter-rouge">venv</code>.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># noexec</span>
python <span class="nt">-m</span> venv venv
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>ثانياً، يجب عليك “تفعيل” البيئة في كل مرة تريد العمل على مشروعك. طريقة التفعيل تختلف قليلاً بين أنظمة التشغيل.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>على Windows:</strong>
    <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># noexec</span>
venv<span class="se">\S</span>cripts<span class="se">\a</span>ctivate
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li><strong>على macOS و Linux:</strong>
    <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># noexec</span>
<span class="nb">source </span>venv/bin/activate
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>عند تفعيل البيئة، ستلاحظ أن اسم البيئة (<code class="highlighter-rouge">venv</code>) يظهر في بداية سطر الأوامر. هذا يعني أنك الآن تعمل داخل هذه البيئة المعزولة.</p>

<p>ثالثاً، عندما تنتهي من العمل على مشروعك، يمكنك الخروج من البيئة الافتراضية ببساطة عن طريق كتابة الأمر <code class="highlighter-rouge">deactivate</code>.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># noexec</span>
deactivate
</code></pre></div></div>

<hr />

<h2 id="2-pip-مدير-حزم-بايثون"><strong>2. <code class="highlighter-rouge">pip</code>: مدير حزم بايثون</strong></h2>

<p>الآن بعد أن أصبحت داخل بيئتك الافتراضية المفعلة، يمكنك استخدام <code class="highlighter-rouge">pip</code> بأمان لتثبيت المكتبات التي يحتاجها مشروعك فقط. <code class="highlighter-rouge">pip</code> هي الأداة الرسمية التي تتصل بمستودع ضخم على الإنترنت يسمى <strong>Python Package Index (PyPI)</strong> لجلب وتثبيت المكتبات.</p>

<h3 id="أ-تثبيت-مكتبة"><strong>أ. تثبيت مكتبة</strong></h3>

<p>سنقوم الآن بتثبيت مكتبة <code class="highlighter-rouge">requests</code>، والتي تستخدم لإجراء طلبات HTTP.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># noexec</span>
pip <span class="nb">install </span>requests
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="ب-عرض-المكتبات-المثبتة"><strong>ب. عرض المكتبات المثبتة</strong></h3>

<p>لمعرفة كل المكتبات الخارجية المثبتة في بيئتك الحالية، استخدم الأمر <code class="highlighter-rouge">pip list</code>.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>pip list
</code></pre></div></div>

<hr />

<h2 id="3-استكشاف-مكتبة-requests-مع-dummyjson-api"><strong>3. استكشاف مكتبة <code class="highlighter-rouge">requests</code> مع DummyJSON API</strong></h2>

<p>هذه هي أشهر مكتبة لجعل التواصل مع الإنترنت وواجهات برمجة التطبيقات (APIs) أمرًا بسيطًا للغاية. سنقوم الآن بكتابة سكربت لجلب بيانات منتجات من واجهة برمجة تطبيقات عامة وموثوقة.</p>

<p><strong>الخطوة الأولى: استيراد المكتبة وتحديد عنوان الـ API</strong>
في بداية السكربت، يجب استيراد المكتبة التي قمنا بتثبيتها. ثم، سنقوم بتعريف عنوان الـ API الذي نريد الوصول إليه في متغير. سنستخدم <code class="highlighter-rouge">dummyjson.com</code> التي توفر بيانات وهمية ممتازة للتجربة.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">requests</span>

<span class="n">api_url</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">"https://dummyjson.com/products/1"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>الخطوة الثانية: إرسال الطلب ومعالجة الأخطاء المحتملة</strong>
سنضع الكود الذي يتصل بالإنترنت داخل كتلة <code class="highlighter-rouge">try...except</code> للتعامل مع أي مشاكل في الاتصال. سنستخدم دالة <code class="highlighter-rouge">get</code> من مكتبة <code class="highlighter-rouge">requests</code> لإرسال الطلب، وسيتم تخزين كل معلومات الاستجابة في متغير اسمه <code class="highlighter-rouge">response</code>.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">try</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">response</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">requests</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">api_url</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="c1"># This line will raise an exception for bad status codes (like 404 or 500)
</span>    <span class="n">response</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">raise_for_status</span><span class="p">()</span> 
<span class="k">except</span> <span class="n">requests</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">exceptions</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">RequestException</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">e</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sa">f</span><span class="s">"An error occurred with the request: </span><span class="si">{</span><span class="n">e</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s">"</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>الخطوة الثالثة: التحقق من نجاح الاستجابة وتحويل البيانات</strong>
بعد التأكد من عدم وجود أخطاء في الاتصال، يجب أن نتحقق من أن الطلب نفسه كان ناجحًا. الرمز <code class="highlighter-rouge">200</code> هو الرمز القياسي للنجاح في بروتوكول HTTP. بعد ذلك، سنستخدم دالة <code class="highlighter-rouge">json</code> المدمجة في كائن الاستجابة، والتي تقوم بتحويل النص القادم من الـ API (والذي يكون بصيغة JSON) إلى قاموس بايثون يمكننا التعامل معه بسهولة.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">data</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">None</span>
<span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">response</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">status_code</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">200</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">data</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">response</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">json</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="k">else</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sa">f</span><span class="s">"Error: Failed to retrieve data. Status code: </span><span class="si">{</span><span class="n">response</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">status_code</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s">"</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>الخطوة الرابعة: استخراج وعرض المعلومات</strong>
الآن بعد أن أصبح لدينا قاموس بايثون، نستخدم المفاتيح للوصول إلى البيانات التي نريدها بالضبط، وفي هذه الحالة هي عنوان المنتج وسعره.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">data</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">product_title</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">data</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'title'</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">product_price</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">data</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'price'</span><span class="p">)</span>
    
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">product_title</span> <span class="ow">and</span> <span class="n">product_price</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sa">f</span><span class="s">"Successfully fetched product data:"</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sa">f</span><span class="s">"Product Title: </span><span class="si">{</span><span class="n">product_title</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s">"</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sa">f</span><span class="s">"Product Price: $</span><span class="si">{</span><span class="n">product_price</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s">"</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">else</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Could not find title or price in the response."</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="4-إدارة-المشاريع-باستخدام-requirementstxt"><strong>4. إدارة المشاريع باستخدام <code class="highlighter-rouge">requirements.txt</code></strong></h2>

<p>عندما تعمل على مشروع وتود مشاركته مع آخرين، كيف تضمن أنهم سيقومون بتثبيت نفس المكتبات التي استخدمتها؟ الحل هو ملف <code class="highlighter-rouge">requirements.txt</code>.</p>

<p>لإنشاء هذا الملف، تأكد من أن بيئتك الافتراضية مفعلة، ثم نفذ الأمر التالي. سيقوم هذا الأمر بحفظ قائمة بكل المكتبات المثبتة في بيئتك الحالية داخل الملف.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>pip freeze <span class="o">&gt;</span> requirements.txt
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>عندما يحصل شخص آخر على مشروعك، كل ما عليه فعله لتثبيت كل المكتبات المطلوبة هو إنشاء بيئته الافتراضية الخاصة، تفعيلها، ثم تشغيل أمر واحد:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>pip <span class="nb">install</span> <span class="nt">-r</span> requirements.txt
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>الخطوة 1: إعداد بيئة المشروع من سطر الأوامر</strong>
(هذه الخطوة تُنفذ مرة واحدة في بداية المشروع)</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">mkdir </span>product_searcher

<p><strong>شرح الخطوة 1:</strong>
بهذه الأوامر، قمنا بإنشاء مساحة عمل معزولة ونظيفة لمشروعنا، وقمنا بتثبيت المكتبة التي سنحتاجها.</p>

<p><strong>الخطوة 2: كتابة سكربت بايثون (ملف <code class="highlighter-rouge">search_app.py</code>)</strong>
الآن، أنشئ ملف <code class="highlighter-rouge">search_app.py</code> واكتب بداخله الكود التالي.</p>

<p>أولاً، سنقوم باستيراد المكتبة، تحديد عنوان الـ API، وطلب الفئة من المستخدم.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">requests</span>

<p><strong>شرح هذه الجزئية:</strong>
نستخدم <code class="highlighter-rouge">try...except</code> للاتصال الآمن. <code class="highlighter-rouge">data.get('products', [])</code> هي طريقة آمنة للحصول على قائمة المنتجات؛ إذا لم يكن المفتاح <code class="highlighter-rouge">'products'</code> موجودًا، فسنحصل على قائمة فارغة بدلاً من خطأ.</p>

<p><strong>شرح هذه الجزئية:</strong>
نستخدم متغيرًا منطقيًا (<code class="highlighter-rouge">found_products</code>) كعلم لتتبع ما إذا كنا قد وجدنا أي منتجات. نتكرر على قائمة <code class="highlighter-rouge">all_products</code>، وداخل الحلقة، نقارن فئة كل منتج مع مدخلات المستخدم. إذا وجدنا تطابقًا، نطبع التفاصيل ونرفع العلم. في النهاية، إذا بقي العلم <code class="highlighter-rouge">False</code>، فهذا يعني أننا لم نجد شيئًا، فنطبع الرسالة المناسبة.</p>

<h3 id="مقدمة-الفصل"><strong>مقدمة الفصل</strong></h3>

<p>واحدة من أعظم نقاط القوة في لغة بايثون هي أنها تأتي “مع بطاريات مدمجة”. هذا يعني أنها لا توفر لك أساسيات اللغة فحسب، بل تأتي أيضًا مع مجموعة ضخمة من الأدوات الجاهزة للاستخدام تسمى <strong>مكتبة بايثون القياسية (Python Standard Library)</strong>.</p>

<p>هذه المكتبة هي مجموعة من <strong>الوحدات (Modules)</strong> التي يمكنك استيرادها في برامجك لأداء مهام متخصصة دون الحاجة لكتابة الكود من الصفر. في هذا الفصل، سنستكشف بعضًا من أهم وأكثر هذه الوحدات استخدامًا، والتي ستحتاجها في العديد من مشاريعك المستقبلية.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="1-ما-هي-الوحدة-وكيف-نستخدمها"><strong>1. ما هي الوحدة وكيف نستخدمها؟</strong></h2>

<p>الوحدة هي ببساطة ملف بايثون (<code class="highlighter-rouge">.py</code>) يحتوي على دوال، كلاسات، ومتغيرات جاهزة للاستخدام. لاستخدام أي وحدة، يجب أولاً “استيرادها” في بداية ملفك باستخدام الكلمة المفتاحية <code class="highlighter-rouge">import</code>.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># To use the math module, we must import it first
# لاستخدام وحدة math، يجب استيرادها أولاً
</span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">math</span>

<ul>
  <li><strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">import math</code></strong>: هذا السطر يخبر بايثون بأننا نريد استخدام الأدوات الموجودة في الوحدة التي اسمها <code class="highlighter-rouge">math</code>.</li>
  <li><strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">math.pi</code></strong>: للوصول إلى دالة أو متغير داخل وحدة، نكتب اسم الوحدة، متبوعًا بنقطة (<code class="highlighter-rouge">.</code>)، ثم اسم الأداة التي نريدها. هنا، <code class="highlighter-rouge">pi</code> هو ثابت (متغير) معرف مسبقًا داخل وحدة <code class="highlighter-rouge">math</code> ويحتوي على قيمة تقريبية للعدد باي.</li>

<p><strong>شرح الخطوة 1:</strong>
نبدأ باستيراد وحدة <code class="highlighter-rouge">datetime</code> لتكون أدواتها متاحة لنا. ثم نستدعي دالة <code class="highlighter-rouge">now</code> من داخلها للحصول على اللحظة الحالية ونخزنها في المتغير <code class="highlighter-rouge">now</code>.</p>

<p><strong>الخطوة 2: تنسيق الوقت وإنشاء رسالة السجل</strong></p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>شرح الخطوة 2:</strong>
نستخدم دالة <code class="highlighter-rouge">strftime</code> لتحويل الوقت من كائن بايثون إلى نص يمكن كتابته في ملف. ثم نستخدم f-string لدمج هذا الوقت المنسق مع رسالة السجل. أضفنا <code class="highlighter-rouge">\n</code> في نهاية الرسالة لضمان أن كل سجل جديد سيكون على سطر منفصل.</p>

<p><strong>شرح الخطوة 3:</strong>
هذا هو الجزء الرئيسي. نفتح الملف <code class="highlighter-rouge">app_log.txt</code> في وضع الإضافة <code class="highlighter-rouge">'a'</code>. نستخدم <code class="highlighter-rouge">with</code> لضمان الإغلاق التلقائي. ثم نستخدم دالة <code class="highlighter-rouge">write</code> لكتابة رسالة السجل التي قمنا بإعدادها. أخيرًا، نطبع رسالة تأكيد للمستخدم.</p>

<p>رغم قوة المكتبة القياسية، إلا أن القوة الحقيقية لمجتمع بايثون تكمن في آلاف المكتبات الخارجية التي طورها المبرمجون حول العالم. في <strong>الفصل الثاني عشر</strong>، سنتعلم كيفية تثبيت هذه المكتبات الخارجية واستخدامها لبناء تطبيقات أكثر قوة وتخصصًا.</p>

<h3 id="مقدمة-الفصل"><strong>مقدمة الفصل</strong></h3>

<p>حتى الآن، تعلمنا تنظيم الكود في <strong>دوال</strong> لتجميع المهام المتكررة. هذا الأسلوب ممتاز، لكن عندما تكبر المشاريع وتصبح أكثر تعقيدًا، نحتاج إلى طريقة لتنظيم ليس فقط <strong>الأفعال (actions)</strong>، بل أيضًا <strong>البيانات (data)</strong> المرتبطة بتلك الأفعال.</p>

<p>هنا يأتي دور <strong>البرمجة كائنية التوجه (Object-Oriented Programming - OOP)</strong>. إنها ليست مجرد مجموعة من الأوامر، بل هي طريقة تفكير ونمط لتصميم البرامج يحاكي العالم الحقيقي. في هذا النمط، نفكر في برنامجنا كمجموعة من “الكائنات” (objects) المستقلة التي تتفاعل مع بعضها البعض. كل كائن لديه خصائصه (بياناته) وسلوكياته (وظائفه).</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="1-الفكرة-الأساسية-من-البيانات-والدوال-إلى-الكائنات"><strong>1. الفكرة الأساسية: من البيانات والدوال إلى الكائنات</strong></h2>

<p>لنفكر في مثال من العالم الحقيقي: <strong>سيارة</strong>.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>خصائص السيارة (البيانات):</strong> لونها، موديلها، سرعتها الحالية، كمية الوقود.</li>
  <li><strong>سلوكيات السيارة (الأفعال):</strong> يمكنها أن تتحرك، تتوقف، تسرّع، تبطئ.</li>
</ul>

<p>في البرمجة التقليدية، قد نخزن هذه البيانات في متغيرات منفصلة، ونكتب دوال منفصلة للتعامل معها.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># الطريقة التقليدية
</span><span class="n">car_model</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">"Toyota"</span>
<span class="n">car_color</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">"Red"</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">move_car</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"The car is moving..."</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>لكن لا يوجد رابط حقيقي بين البيانات والدوال.</p>

<p>في البرمجة كائنية التوجه، نقوم بتجميع كل ما يتعلق بالسيارة (بياناتها وسلوكياتها) داخل وحدة واحدة تسمى <strong>كائن (object)</strong>.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="2-المخطط-الأساسي-الكلاس-class"><strong>2. المخطط الأساسي: الكلاس (Class)</strong></h2>

<p>قبل أن نبني سيارة حقيقية، نحتاج إلى مخطط أو تصميم (blueprint). في OOP، هذا المخطط هو <strong>الكلاس (Class)</strong>.</p>

<p>الكلاس هو القالب الذي نستخدمه لإنشاء الكائنات. إنه يصف ما هي الخصائص والسلوكيات التي سيمتلكها أي كائن يتم إنشاؤه منه.</p>

<p><strong>كيف نعرّف كلاسًا بسيطًا:</strong>
نستخدم الكلمة المفتاحية <code class="highlighter-rouge">class</code>.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># Define a class named 'Car'
# تعريف كلاس اسمه 'Car'
</span><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Car</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">pass</span> <span class="c1"># 'pass' is a placeholder for future code
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>شرح الكود بالتفصيل:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">class Car:</code></strong>: هذا السطر يعلن عن إنشاء كلاس جديد اسمه <code class="highlighter-rouge">Car</code>. جرت العادة أن تبدأ أسماء الكلاسات بحرف كبير.</li>
  <li><strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">pass</code></strong>: هي كلمة مفتاحية في بايثون لا تفعل شيئًا. نستخدمها هنا لأن بنية الكلاس لا يمكن أن تكون فارغة، وهي بمثابة “مؤقت” إلى أن نضيف الخصائص والدوال لاحقًا.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="3-المُنشِئ-دالة-__init__"><strong>3. المُنشِئ: دالة <code class="highlighter-rouge">__init__</code></strong></h2>

<p>عندما ننشئ كائنًا جديدًا من كلاس (أي عندما نبني سيارة حقيقية من المخطط)، غالبًا ما نرغب في تحديد خصائصه الأولية (مثل لونها وموديلها). هنا يأتي دور دالة خاصة جدًا اسمها <code class="highlighter-rouge">__init__</code>.</p>

<p>تُسمى هذه الدالة بـ <strong>المُنشِئ (constructor)</strong>، ويتم استدعاؤها تلقائيًا في كل مرة يتم فيها إنشاء كائن جديد من الكلاس.</p>

<p><strong>فهم <code class="highlighter-rouge">self</code> والخصائص (Attributes):</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">self</code></strong>: هو معامل إلزامي في كل دوال الكلاس، وهو يشير إلى <strong>الكائن نفسه</strong> الذي يتم إنشاؤه أو استخدامه. يمكنك التفكير فيه ككلمة “أنا” بالنسبة للكائن.</li>
  <li><strong>الخصائص (Attributes)</strong>: هي المتغيرات التي تنتمي إلى الكائن، ونقوم بتعريفها داخل دالة <code class="highlighter-rouge">__init__</code> باستخدام <code class="highlighter-rouge">self</code>.</li>
</ul>

هنا نرى قوة OOP في العمل. أنشأنا كائنًا <code class="highlighter-rouge">account1</code>، ثم بدأنا بالتفاعل معه باستخدام الدوال التي صممناها. الكود منظم وسهل القراءة، حيث أن كل عملية (إيداع، سحب) هي استدعاء لدالة واضحة الاسم على الكائن الذي يخص “Ahmed”.</p>

<h3 id="مقدمة-الفصل"><strong>مقدمة الفصل</strong></h3>

<p>لا يوجد مبرمج في العالم يكتب كودًا خاليًا من الأخطاء تمامًا. الأخطاء هي جزء طبيعي من عملية البرمجة. يمكن أن تحدث لأسباب عديدة: المستخدم قد يُدخل قيمة غير متوقعة، قد تحاول فتح ملف غير موجود، أو قد تقوم بعملية حسابية غير ممكنة مثل القسمة على صفر.</p>

<p>عندما يحدث خطأ أثناء تشغيل برنامج بايثون، فإنه “يثير استثناءً” (raises an exception). إذا لم يتم التعامل مع هذا الاستثناء، سيتوقف برنامجك عن العمل فجأة، وهو ما يترك انطباعًا سيئًا لدى المستخدم.</p>

<p>في هذا الفصل، ستتعلم كيف تكتب برامج قوية ومرنة، قادرة على “التقاط” هذه الاستثناءات والتعامل معها بأناقة، بدلاً من الانهيار. هذه المهارة هي إحدى العلامات الفارقة التي تميز المبرمج المحترف عن المبتدئ.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="1-ما-هو-الاستثناء-وأشهر-أنواعه"><strong>1. ما هو الاستثناء؟ وأشهر أنواعه</strong></h2>

<p>الاستثناء هو حدث (خطأ) يعترض السير الطبيعي لبرنامجك. بايثون تحتوي على العديد من أنواع الاستثناءات المدمجة، ولكل منها اسم يدل على طبيعة الخطأ.</p>

<p><strong>أشهر أنواع الاستثناءات التي ستواجهها:</strong></p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: left;">اسم الاستثناء</th>
      <th style="text-align: left;">سبب الحدوث</th>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: left;"><code class="highlighter-rouge">ValueError</code></td>
      <td style="text-align: left;">عندما تكون قيمة البيانات غير مناسبة (مثل محاولة تحويل نص ليس رقمًا إلى رقم).</td>

<h2 id="2-التقاط-الأخطاء-باستخدام-try-و-except"><strong>2. التقاط الأخطاء باستخدام <code class="highlighter-rouge">try</code> و <code class="highlighter-rouge">except</code></strong></h2>

<p>لتجنب توقف البرنامج، يمكننا وضع الكود الذي نشك أنه قد يسبب خطأً داخل كتلة <code class="highlighter-rouge">try</code>. وإذا حدث خطأ بالفعل، فسيتم تنفيذ الكود الموجود داخل كتلة <code class="highlighter-rouge">except</code> المرتبطة به.</p>

<p><strong>البنية الأساسية:</strong></p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">try</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="c1"># Code that might cause an error

<p><strong>مثال عملي:</strong>
لنتخيل أننا نطلب من المستخدم إدخال عمره. المستخدم قد يخطئ ويدخل نصًا بدلاً من رقم.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">try</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="c1"># We try to convert the user's input to an integer

<p><strong>شرح الكود بالتفصيل:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li><strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">try:</code></strong>: نضع الكود “الخطير” داخل هذه الكتلة. في هذه الحالة، السطر <code class="highlighter-rouge">age = int(age_str)</code> هو مصدر الخطر، لأنه سيفشل إذا أدخل المستخدم نصًا مثل “عشرون”.</li>
  <li><strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">except:</code></strong>: إذا فشل أي سطر داخل كتلة <code class="highlighter-rouge">try</code> وأثار استثناءً، فإن بايثون تتوقف فورًا عن تنفيذ بقية كتلة <code class="highlighter-rouge">try</code> وتقفز مباشرة لتنفيذ الكود الموجود داخل كتلة <code class="highlighter-rouge">except</code>.</li>
  <li>بهذه الطريقة، بدلاً من أن يتوقف البرنامج ويعرض رسالة خطأ حمراء غير مفهومة للمستخدم، فإنه يعرض رسالة واضحة ولطيفة تخبر المستخدم بكيفية تصحيح خطئه، ثم يواصل عمله بشكل طبيعي (أو ينتهي بأمان).</li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h2 id="3-التعامل-مع-أنواع-محددة-من-الأخطاء"><strong>3. التعامل مع أنواع محددة من الأخطاء</strong></h2>

<p>الكتلة <code class="highlighter-rouge">except:</code> العامة تلتقط أي نوع من الأخطاء، لكن هذا ليس دائمًا السلوك المرغوب. من الأفضل تحديد نوع الخطأ الذي تتوقع حدوثه بالضبط. هذا يجعل كودك أكثر دقة ووضوحًا، ويمنع إخفاء أخطاء غير متوقعة.</p>

<p><strong>مثال: آلة حاسبة آمنة</strong>
هذا البرنامج قد يواجه خطأين محتملين: <code class="highlighter-rouge">ValueError</code> إذا أدخل المستخدم نصًا، و <code class="highlighter-rouge">ZeroDivisionError</code> إذا حاول القسمة على صفر.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">try</span><span class="p">:</span>

<p><strong>شرح الكود بالتفصيل:</strong>
يمكنك إضافة أي عدد من كتل <code class="highlighter-rouge">except</code> بعد <code class="highlighter-rouge">try</code>. عندما يحدث خطأ، سيبحث بايثون عن أول كتلة <code class="highlighter-rouge">except</code> تطابق نوع الخطأ الذي حدث ويقوم بتنفيذها. هذا يسمح لك بتخصيص رسائل مختلفة واستجابات مختلفة لكل نوع من المشاكل المحتملة.</p>

<p>في الفصل السابق، قمنا ببناء برنامج بسيط لدفتر الملاحظات. الآن، سنقوم بتحسينه ليكون أكثر قوة. سنضيف خيارًا جديدًا وهو “عرض الملاحظات”. يجب أن يتعامل هذا الخيار مع الحالة التي يحاول فيها المستخدم عرض الملاحظات ولكن الملف <code class="highlighter-rouge">notes.txt</code> غير موجود بعد.</p>

<h3 id="إرشادات-الحل"><strong>إرشادات الحل:</strong></h3>

<ol>
  <li><strong>أضف خيارًا جديدًا للقائمة:</strong> في البرنامج، أضف خيارًا رقم “2” في القائمة لعرض الملاحظات.</li>
  <li><strong>استخدم <code class="highlighter-rouge">try...except</code>:</strong> عند تنفيذ خيار عرض الملاحظات، ضع الكود الذي يقرأ الملف داخل كتلة <code class="highlighter-rouge">try</code>.</li>
  <li><strong>التقط الخطأ الصحيح:</strong> في كتلة <code class="highlighter-rouge">except</code>، التقط نوع الخطأ المحدد <code class="highlighter-rouge">FileNotFoundError</code>.</li>
  <li><strong>اعرض رسالة مناسبة:</strong> إذا تم التقاط الخطأ، اطبع رسالة واضحة للمستخدم مثل “لا توجد ملاحظات لعرضها بعد. حاول إضافة ملاحظة أولاً.”</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="مقدمة-الفصل"><strong>مقدمة الفصل</strong></h3>

<p>حتى هذه اللحظة، كل البيانات التي تعاملنا معها في برامجنا (مثل قيم المتغيرات أو عناصر القوائم) كانت تُخزّن في ذاكرة الحاسوب المؤقتة (RAM). هذا يعني أنها تُفقد تمامًا بمجرد إغلاق البرنامج.</p>

<p>لكن ماذا لو أردنا حفظ هذه البيانات بشكل دائم؟ ماذا لو أردنا أن يتذكر برنامجنا المهام التي أضافها المستخدم بالأمس، أو حفظ إعدادات معينة؟ هنا يأتي دور <strong>التعامل مع الملفات (File Handling)</strong>.</p>

<p>في هذا الفصل، سنتعلم كيفية جعل برامجنا تقوم بـ:</p>

<ul>
  <li>قراءة البيانات من ملفات نصية موجودة على القرص الصلب.</li>
  <li>كتابة بيانات جديدة إلى ملفات.</li>
  <li>تعديل محتوى الملفات عبر إضافة بيانات جديدة إليها.</li>
</ul>

<p>هذه المهارة أساسية لبناء أي تطبيق حقيقي يتجاوز كونه مجرد برنامج مؤقت.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="1-فتح-الملفات-بوابة-التعامل-مع-البيانات"><strong>1. فتح الملفات: بوابة التعامل مع البيانات</strong></h2>

<p>الخطوة الأولى دائمًا هي فتح الملف الذي نريد التعامل معه. نستخدم لهذا الغرض دالة بايثون المدمجة <code class="highlighter-rouge">open</code>. عند استدعاء هذه الدالة، يجب أن نحدد شيئين أساسيين: اسم الملف، و<strong>الوضع (mode)</strong> الذي نريد أن نفتح به الملف.</p>

<p><strong>أهم أوضاع فتح الملفات:</strong></p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: left;">الوضع</th>
      <th style="text-align: left;">اسم الوضع</th>
      <th style="text-align: left;">الوصف</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: left;"><code class="highlighter-rouge">'r'</code></td>
      <td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Read</strong> (قراءة)</td>
      <td style="text-align: left;">يفتح الملف للقراءة فقط. هذا هو الوضع الافتراضي. يسبب خطأ إذا كان الملف غير موجود.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: left;"><code class="highlighter-rouge">'w'</code></td>
      <td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Write</strong> (كتابة)</td>
      <td style="text-align: left;">يفتح الملف للكتابة. <strong>إذا كان الملف موجودًا، سيتم مسح محتواه بالكامل</strong>. إذا لم يكن موجودًا، سيقوم بإنشائه.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: left;"><code class="highlighter-rouge">'a'</code></td>
      <td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Append</strong> (إضافة)</td>
      <td style="text-align: left;">يفتح الملف لإضافة بيانات جديدة في <strong>نهايته</strong>. لا يقوم بمسح المحتوى الحالي. إذا لم يكن موجودًا، سيقوم بإنشائه.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h2 id="2-الكتابة-في-ملف-w"><strong>2. الكتابة في ملف (<code class="highlighter-rouge">'w'</code>)</strong></h2>

<p>لنبدأ بأول عملية، وهي كتابة بعض البيانات في ملف جديد.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># Create a file object by opening a file in write mode ('w')
# سيقوم بإنشاء الملف 'greeting.txt' إذا لم يكن موجودًا

<span class="c1"># Write a string to the file

</span>
<span class="c1"># Write another string on a new line
</span><span class="nb">file</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">write</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s">This is the second line."</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1"># \n لإضافة سطر جديد
</span>
<span class="c1"># It's crucial to close the file to save the changes
</span><span class="nb">file</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">close</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="c1"># إغلاق الملف لحفظ التغييرات
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>شرح الكود بالتفصيل:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li><strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">file = open("greeting.txt", "w")</code></strong>: هنا نطلب من بايثون فتح (أو إنشاء) ملف اسمه <code class="highlighter-rouge">greeting.txt</code> في وضع الكتابة <code class="highlighter-rouge">'w'</code>. الناتج من هذه العملية هو “كائن ملف” (file object)، قمنا بتخزينه في المتغير <code class="highlighter-rouge">file</code>. هذا الكائن هو الذي نستخدمه للتفاعل مع الملف.</li>
  <li><strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">file.write(...)</code></strong>: نستخدم دالة <code class="highlighter-rouge">write</code> التابعة لكائن الملف لكتابة النصوص. في السطر الثاني من الكتابة، استخدمنا <code class="highlighter-rouge">\n</code>، وهو رمز خاص يعني “سطر جديد” (newline)، لضمان أن النص التالي سيأتي في سطر منفصل.</li>
  <li><strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">file.close()</code></strong>: هذه الخطوة ضرورية جدًا. عند الكتابة في ملف، قد لا يتم حفظ البيانات على القرص الصلب فورًا، بل تبقى في ذاكرة مؤقتة. إغلاق الملف يضمن أن كل التغييرات تم حفظها بشكل كامل، كما أنه يحرر الملف ليتمكن نظام التشغيل من استخدامه في مكان آخر.</li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h2 id="3-الطريقة-الأفضل-للتعامل-مع-الملفات-with"><strong>3. الطريقة الأفضل للتعامل مع الملفات: <code class="highlighter-rouge">with</code></strong></h2>

<p>تذكر إغلاق الملف يدويًا في كل مرة قد يكون أمرًا مرهقًا وعرضة للنسيان، مما قد يسبب مشاكل في برنامجك. لحسن الحظ، توفر بايثون طريقة أفضل وأكثر أمانًا تضمن إغلاق الملف تلقائيًا، وهي باستخدام جملة <code class="highlighter-rouge">with</code>.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># The 'with' statement ensures the file is automatically closed

<span class="c1"># No need to call f.close(), Python handles it automatically
# لا داعي لاستدعاء دالة الإغلاق، بايثون تتكفل بذلك
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>شرح الكود بالتفصيل:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li><strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">with open(...) as f:</code></strong>: هذه هي البنية الأساسية. جملة <code class="highlighter-rouge">with</code> تقوم بإنشاء “سياق” (context). كل الكود الذي يأتي داخل هذه الكتلة (بمسافة بادئة) يمكنه استخدام كائن الملف الذي تم تخزينه في المتغير <code class="highlighter-rouge">f</code> (يمكنك اختيار أي اسم).</li>
  <li><strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">encoding="utf-8"</code></strong>: هذا جزء مهم جدًا، خاصة عند التعامل مع نصوص غير إنجليزية مثل اللغة العربية. <code class="highlighter-rouge">utf-8</code> هو معيار ترميز عالمي يسمح بتخزين وعرض جميع الأحرف والرموز من مختلف اللغات بشكل صحيح. <strong>اعتد دائمًا على إضافة <code class="highlighter-rouge">encoding="utf-8"</code> عند التعامل مع الملفات النصية لتجنب أي مشاكل مستقبلية.</strong></li>
  <li>بمجرد انتهاء كتلة <code class="highlighter-rouge">with</code> (أي عند الخروج من المسافة البادئة)، يقوم بايثون تلقائيًا بإغلاق الملف، حتى لو حدث خطأ داخل الكتلة. هذا يجعل كودك أكثر موثوقية وأمانًا.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
  <li><strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">try...except FileNotFoundError</code></strong>: لقد قمنا بوضع كود القراءة داخل كتلة <code class="highlighter-rouge">try</code> لمعالجة خطأ شائع وهو <code class="highlighter-rouge">FileNotFoundError</code>. إذا لم يكن الملف موجودًا، سيقوم البرنامج بطباعة رسالة خطأ واضحة بدلاً من التوقف عن العمل.</li>
  <li><strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">file.read()</code></strong>: هذه الدالة تقرأ محتوى الملف بالكامل من البداية إلى النهاية وتعيده كنص واحد (string). هذا مناسب للملفات الصغيرة.</li>
  <li><strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">for line in file:</code></strong>: هذه هي الطريقة الأكثر كفاءة لقراءة الملفات الكبيرة. بدلاً من تحميل الملف بأكمله في الذاكرة، تقوم حلقة <code class="highlighter-rouge">for</code> بقراءة الملف سطرًا بسطر، مما يستهلك ذاكرة أقل بكثير.</li>
  <li><strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">line.strip()</code></strong>: عند القراءة سطرًا بسطر، كل سطر ينتهي برمز السطر الجديد <code class="highlighter-rouge">\n</code>. دالة <code class="highlighter-rouge">strip</code> تقوم بإزالة أي مسافات فارغة (بما في ذلك <code class="highlighter-rouge">\n</code>) من بداية ونهاية النص، مما يجعل الطباعة أكثر نظافة.</li>

<h3 id="إرشادات-الحل"><strong>إرشادات الحل:</strong></h3>

<ol>
  <li><strong>اطلب من المستخدم إدخال ملاحظته:</strong> استخدم دالة <code class="highlighter-rouge">input</code> للحصول على نص الملاحظة من المستخدم وخزّنها في متغير.</li>
  <li><strong>افتح ملف الملاحظات:</strong> استخدم بنية <code class="highlighter-rouge">with open</code> لفتح ملف (ليكن اسمه <code class="highlighter-rouge">notes.txt</code>) في وضع الإضافة <code class="highlighter-rouge">'a'</code> مع ترميز <code class="highlighter-rouge">'utf-8'</code>.</li>

</ol>

<h3 id="الحل-المقترح-خطوة-بخطوة"><strong>الحل المقترح خطوة بخطوة:</strong></h3>

<p><strong>الخطوة 1: الحصول على مدخلات المستخدم</strong></p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># Ask the user to enter their note

<p><strong>شرح الخطوة 1:</strong>
هذا السطر بسيط ومباشر. نستخدم دالة <code class="highlighter-rouge">input</code> لعرض رسالة للمستخدم، ثم ننتظر منه كتابة ملاحظته. النص الذي يكتبه المستخدم يتم تخزينه في المتغير <code class="highlighter-rouge">note_text</code>.</p>

<p><strong>الخطوة 2: فتح الملف والكتابة فيه</strong></p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># Open the file in append mode ('a') to add the new note

<p><strong>شرح الخطوة 2:</strong>
هنا يكمن جوهر التمرين.</p>

<ul>
  <li>نستخدم <code class="highlighter-rouge">with open</code> لضمان أن الملف سيُغلق تلقائيًا.</li>
  <li>اسم الملف هو <code class="highlighter-rouge">"notes.txt"</code>.</li>
  <li>الوضع <code class="highlighter-rouge">'a'</code> (append) يعني أننا سنضيف إلى نهاية الملف. إذا لم يكن الملف موجودًا، سيتم إنشاؤه تلقائيًا في المرة الأولى.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">encoding="utf-8"</code> يضمن دعم اللغة العربية.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">f.write(note_text + "\n")</code> تقوم بكتابة الملاحظة التي أدخلها المستخدم، ونقوم بإلحاق <code class="highlighter-rouge">\n</code> بها للتأكد من أن كل ملاحظة مستقبلية ستبدأ على سطرها الخاص.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>الخطوة 3: طباعة رسالة تأكيد</strong></p>

<h3 id="مقدمة-الفصل"><strong>مقدمة الفصل</strong></h3>

<p>حتى الآن، تعاملنا مع أنواع بيانات أساسية تخزن قيمة واحدة فقط (مثل رقم أو نص). لكن في البرمجة الحقيقية، نادرًا ما تكون البيانات بهذه البساطة. غالبًا ما نحتاج إلى التعامل مع <strong>مجموعات من البيانات</strong> المترابطة، مثل قائمة بأسماء الطلاب، أو بطاقة معلومات لموظف تحتوي على اسمه وعمره وراتبه.</p>

<p>هنا تأتي أهمية <strong>هياكل البيانات (Data Structures)</strong>. هي طرق متخصصة لتنظيم وتخزين البيانات لتسهيل الوصول إليها وإدارتها بكفاءة. في هذا الفصل، سنتعمق في أهم ثلاثة هياكل بيانات أساسية في بايثون، والتي ستستخدمها في كل مشاريعك تقريبًا:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>القوائم (Lists):</strong> مجموعات مرتبة وقابلة للتعديل.</li>
  <li><strong>المجموعات الثابتة (Tuples):</strong> مجموعات مرتبة ولكن غير قابلة للتعديل.</li>
  <li><strong>القواميس (Dictionaries):</strong> مجموعات لتخزين البيانات على شكل “مفتاح-قيمة”.</li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h2 id="1-القوائم-lists"><strong>1. القوائم (Lists)</strong></h2>

<p>القائمة هي أكثر هياكل البيانات مرونة وشيوعًا في بايثون. يمكنك التفكير فيها كحاوية ديناميكية يمكنك إضافة عناصر إليها أو حذفها أو تعديلها في أي وقت.</p>

<p><strong>خصائص القائمة:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>مرتبة (Ordered):</strong> العناصر تحافظ على ترتيبها الذي أُضيفت به.</li>
  <li><strong>قابلة للتعديل (Mutable):</strong> يمكنك تغيير محتوياتها بعد إنشائها.</li>
  <li><strong>تسمح بالتكرار:</strong> يمكن أن تحتوي على نفس العنصر أكثر من مرة.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>إنشاء قائمة:</strong>
لإنشاء قائمة، نضع العناصر بين قوسين مربعين <code class="highlighter-rouge">[]</code> ونفصل بينها بفاصلة.</p>

<p><strong>شرح الكود:</strong>
في هذا المثال، قمنا بإنشاء ثلاث قوائم مختلفة. <code class="highlighter-rouge">fruits</code> تحتوي على نصوص، و <code class="highlighter-rouge">numbers</code> تحتوي على أرقام، بينما <code class="highlighter-rouge">mixed_list</code> توضح مرونة القوائم في احتواء أنواع بيانات مختلفة في نفس الوقت.</p>

<h3 id="الوصول-إلى-عناصر-القائمة-indexing"><strong>الوصول إلى عناصر القائمة (Indexing)</strong></h3>

<p>يمكنك الوصول إلى أي عنصر في القائمة باستخدام <strong>فهرسه (index)</strong>. تذكر دائمًا أن الفهرسة في بايثون تبدأ من الصفر <code class="highlighter-rouge">0</code>.</p>

<p><strong>شرح الكود:</strong>
نستخدم الأقواس المربعة <code class="highlighter-rouge">[]</code> بعد اسم القائمة ونضع بداخلها رقم الفهرس. <code class="highlighter-rouge">languages[0]</code> يعطينا العنصر الأول وهو “Python”. بايثون تدعم أيضًا الفهرسة السلبية، حيث <code class="highlighter-rouge">[-1]</code> يشير دائمًا إلى العنصر الأخير, و <code class="highlighter-rouge">[-2]</code> إلى العنصر قبل الأخير، وهكذا.</p>

<h2 id="2-المجموعات-الثابتة-tuples"><strong>2. المجموعات الثابتة (Tuples)</strong></h2>

<p>المجموعة الثابتة، أو الـ <code class="highlighter-rouge">tuple</code>، تشبه القائمة إلى حد كبير، لكن مع فرق جوهري واحد: <strong>هي غير قابلة للتعديل (Immutable)</strong>. بمجرد إنشائها، لا يمكنك تغيير محتوياتها.</p>

<p><strong>خصائص المجموعة الثابتة:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>مرتبة (Ordered):</strong> تحافظ على ترتيب عناصرها.</li>
  <li><strong>غير قابلة للتعديل (Immutable):</strong> لا يمكن تغييرها بعد الإنشاء.</li>
  <li><strong>تسمح بالتكرار.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>إنشاء مجموعة ثابتة:</strong>
لإنشاء <code class="highlighter-rouge">tuple</code>، نستخدم الأقواس العادية <code class="highlighter-rouge">()</code>.</p>

<p><strong>شرح الكود:</strong>
التعامل مع الـ <code class="highlighter-rouge">tuple</code> من حيث الوصول للعناصر مشابه تمامًا للقوائم. لكن السطر الأخير في التعليقات يوضح نقطة القوة (والضعف) في الـ <code class="highlighter-rouge">tuple</code>؛ أي محاولة لتغيير عنصر ستؤدي إلى خطأ برمجي.</p>

<p><strong>متى نستخدم الـ <code class="highlighter-rouge">tuple</code>؟</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>عندما يكون لديك بيانات لا ينبغي أن تتغير أبدًا، مثل إحداثيات جغرافية، أو ألوان ثابتة، أو إعدادات برنامج.</li>
  <li>استخدامها يوفر حماية ضد التغيير العرضي للبيانات.</li>
  <li>قد تكون أسرع بشكل طفيف في الأداء من القوائم في بعض الحالات.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="3-القواميس-dictionaries"><strong>3. القواميس (Dictionaries)</strong></h2>

<p>القاموس هو هيكل بيانات فريد لا يعتمد على الفهرسة الرقمية، بل يخزن البيانات على شكل أزواج من <strong>مفتاح وقيمة (key-value pairs)</strong>. يمكنك التفكير فيه كقاموس لغوي حقيقي، حيث تبحث عن كلمة (المفتاح) لتحصل على تعريفها (القيمة).</p>

<p><strong>خصائص القاموس:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>غير مرتب (Unordered) (في نسخ بايثون قبل 3.7) / مرتب (في 3.7 وما بعدها):</strong> كقاعدة عامة، لا تعتمد على ترتيب عناصر القاموس.</li>
  <li><strong>قابل للتعديل (Mutable):</strong> يمكنك إضافة وتعديل وحذف أزواج المفتاح-القيمة.</li>
  <li><strong>المفاتيح فريدة (Unique Keys):</strong> لا يمكن أن يحتوي القاموس على مفتاحين متماثلين.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>إنشاء قاموس:</strong>
لإنشاء قاموس، نستخدم الأقواس المعقوفة <code class="highlighter-rouge">{}</code> ونحدد أزواج المفتاح-القيمة.</p>
