            As the Python programming language continues to grow in popularity, our work here at PSF is also growing and evolving. To support our ongoing success, the Python Software Foundation (PSF) is promoting Loren Crary to Deputy Executive Director effective immediately. <br /><br />"Loren Crary’s promotion to Deputy Executive Director is a testament to her outstanding contributions, both within and beyond her official scope as Director of Resource Development. Her leadership and dedication have been instrumental in advancing the Python Software Foundation’s mission, and her new role marks another fantastic step forward for our organization. The entire community benefits from her vision and expertise, and we are thrilled she has accepted this position." Dawn Wages, PSF Board Chair<br /><br />Crary’s work at the PSF has been exemplary and she is constantly widening the frame on the work that she does here. This promotion serves to formally recognize that Loren’s role here has expanded, and that her increased responsibility is part of our ongoing plan to set the PSF up for continued growth and success. <br /><br />“When people step up and show that they are willing to learn and change and grow, it’s a huge win for small organizations like the PSF. I’m so glad that we can promote Loren and look forward to many more years with her here at the PSF.” Deb Nicholson, PSF Executive Director<br /><br />Loren has been serving the PSF for over three years as our Director of Resource Development and has been continually deepening her responsibilities. She will continue to bolster our strategic planning and budgeting processes with the Board and staff. She will also continue to provide support for our Program Director, Olivia Sauls, on the planning and execution of PyCon US going forward. Loren will also continue her stewardship of the PSF’s revenue, including sponsorships and developing new revenue channels, and continue to collaborate with our Community Communications Manager, Marie Nordin, in her work on community, outgoing grants, and communication work across the whole organization. <br /><br />___________________________________________________________<br /><br /><i>The mission of the Python Software Foundation is to promote, protect, and advance the Python programming language, and to support and facilitate the growth of a<a href="https://www.python.org/psf/diversity/"> diverse</a> and international community of Python programmers.

<p>If you've been on Mastodon for long enough it's likely you've heard the phrase “you are the algorithm” in reference to the fact that Mastodon by default doesn't provide algorithmic curation of your timeline. Instead, Mastodon implements a simple linear timeline and users are expected to "boost" posts so they reach a wider audience, specifically their own followers. I'll be calling Mastodon's approach "boost curation" in this post.</p>

<p>Don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of understandable systems and a <a href="https://sethmlarson.dev/for-you-is-not-for-me">critic of algorithmic curation</a>. I do wonder if Mastodon's allergy to algorithm curation does not play well for folks who have different expectations of social media, such as wanting more "town-square" moments [1] where a substantial number of users are talking about one or two topics that interest them all at once.</p>

<p>Here are some other downsides of boost curation compared to algorithmic curation:</p>

<ul>
<li>Boosts are only applied during your waking hours, meaning your followers in different timezones than you don't ever "benefit" from your curation.</li>
<li>Boosts immediately put content to the top of feeds, meaning whatever you see during a given interaction with Mastodon is likely to be one or two people boosting tons of posts in succession rather than a blend of boosted posts and new posts from your followers.</li>
<li>Boosts can mean that a post is seen more than once by a single person over the course of a day. This phenomenon might exacerbate the feeling of there being less content on Mastodon compared to other social media platforms.</li>
<li>Once a post is no longer being boosted it almost immediately craters because everyone's feeds move on to new content. With algorithmic curation this post would have chances for "second-winds" by being offered to readers outside the linear timeline.</li>
</ul>

<p>So what can be done about the above issues while maintaining a linear algorithm-less timeline?</p>

<h2>Breaking assumptions for smarter boosts</h2>

<p>Many other networked systems have methods for clients to "collaborate" and achieve a goal that helps users without actually needing to know intimate details about other implementations (which is impossible in a diverse ecosystem of clients) or to share additional information between clients. An example that comes to mind here is the different <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_congestion_control">TCP congestion control algorithms</a> which collaborate to maximize bandwidth without needing to directly share information.</p>

<p>What if selecting "boost" in a Mastodon client didn't mean the post was reposted <em>immediately</em> to your followers, only that the post would be reposted <em>eventually</em> at the clients' discretion? To keep control in the users' hands, clients could offer an override to repost immediately, like a double-tap?</p>

<p>With this assumption broken, the client is now allowed to be "smart" by choosing the timing when the boost is applied to a post. The following simple logic could be implemented:</p>

<ul>
<li>If the post was created recently, wait for a bit to see if the post garners any other boosts. This is done because the post is likely already at the "top" of relevant feeds.</li>
<li>If the post hadn't been boosted recently and the client hadn't boosted another post recently: boost the post. By only boosting one post at a time the client isn't clogging everyone's feeds with only boosts from a single account.</li>
<li>If not, delay for some amount of time and reevaluate.</li>
</ul>

<p>The above basic routine could be refined mostly by how the "delay" is calculated.
The delay could be a simple whole number or more complicated, like taking into account information about your followers or recent posts on the same topic. To avoid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thundering_herd_problem">thundering herds</a> between like-minded clients this delay could be treated
almost like a "retry" where a random jitter is applied.</p>

<p>Are there any Mastodon clients that already implement something similar to this that I'm not aware of? What pitfalls or other choices could a client make to make this behavior better? Send me your thoughts on this topic or Mastodon in general.</p>

          <p class="text-base-content">
            <p>I ran into an interesting problem with SQL the other day: how do you update multiple rows
while maintaining an uniqueness constraint?</p>
<p>I have a table where each row describes an item in an ordered list. Each row has a <code>position</code> value. They are
integers, not necessarily contiguous but each unique. A larger <code>position</code> means the row is further down the list. For
reordering the rows, I sometimes need to make space between two positions.</p>
<p>How do you do that? Well, the obvious answer is a simple update statement, assuming you want to make space for one item before <code>position</code> 5:</p>
<pre class="language-sql " style="background-color: #2b303b; color: #c0c5ce;"><code class="language-sql"><span style="color: #b48ead;">UPDATE</span><span> table
</span><span style="color: #b48ead;">SET</span><span> position = position + </span><span style="color: #d08770;">1
</span><span style="color: #b48ead;">WHERE</span><span> position &gt;= </span><span style="color: #d08770;">5
</span></code></pre>
<p>Despite having used SQL since the 90s I don't think I've ever needed to do this before. It seemed simple enough, but I found out the solution I went with is not only obvious but also wrong. When you have contiguous <code>position</code> values, that statement causes a unique constraint violation, in both SQLite and PostgreSQL. Having transaction isolation doesn't prevent collisions during updates, even if the end state would be valid.</p>
<p>A helpful LLM tried to suggest the broken solution, then a solution that caused a syntax error and then a solution that involved creating a temporary table. After that I went back to searching the web and finally found a mention about negating the values temporarily which sounded like way less hassle than temporary tables.</p>
<p>That worked great. So, to add space for <em>N</em> items before <code>position</code> <em>X</em>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Begin transaction.</li>
<li>Instead of incrementing the value on each row greater than or equal to <em>X</em> by <em>N</em>, multiply the value by -1 and decrement it by <em>N</em>.</li>
<li>Multiply each value smaller than zero by -1.</li>
<li>Commit.</li>
</ol>
<pre class="language-sql " style="background-color: #2b303b; color: #c0c5ce;"><code class="language-sql"><span style="color: #b48ead;">BEGIN</span><span> TRANSACTION;
</span><span>
</span><span style="color: #b48ead;">UPDATE</span><span> table
</span><span style="color: #b48ead;">SET</span><span> position = -position - </span><span style="color: #d08770;">1
</span><span style="color: #b48ead;">WHERE</span><span> position &gt;= </span><span style="color: #d08770;">5</span><span>;
</span><span>
</span><span style="color: #b48ead;">UPDATE</span><span> table
</span><span style="color: #b48ead;">SET</span><span> position = -position
</span><span style="color: #b48ead;">WHERE</span><span> position &lt; </span><span style="color: #d08770;">0</span><span>;
</span><span>
</span><span style="color: #b48ead;">COMMIT</span><span>;

<p>We are proud to announce the 7.6 release of <a href="https://www.tryton.org/">Tryton</a>.<br />
This release provides many bug fixes, performance improvements and some fine tuning.<br />
You can give it a <a href="https://www.tryton.org/demo">try on the demo server</a>, <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/tryton/tryton/">use the docker image</a> or <a href="https://www.tryton.org/download">download it here</a>.<br />
As usual <a href="https://docs.tryton.org/7.6/server/topics/setup_database.html#update-a-database">upgrading from previous series</a> is fully supported.</p>
<p>Here is a list of the most noticeable changes:</p>
<h2 id="heading--user">Changes for the User</h2>
<h3 id="heading--user-client">Client</h3>
<p>We added a new menu entry on the list to reset the column widths to their original size.</p>
<p></p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://discuss-cdn.tryton.org/uploads/default/original/2X/d/dac201d9ad502f3d6c460d4fdbb3d19d0d5a560a.png" title="Menu entry of reset column widths"><img alt="Menu entry of reset column widths" height="500" src="https://discuss-cdn.tryton.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/d/dac201d9ad502f3d6c460d4fdbb3d19d0d5a560a_2_217x500.png" width="217" /></a></div><p></p>
<p>A new widget has been added on the form to pick a color.</p>
<p></p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://discuss-cdn.tryton.org/uploads/default/original/2X/b/b4f65d54dfdcaf99d56bd8d469994928f2ef2acb.png" title="Color widget on product attribute"><img alt="Color widget on product attribute" height="500" src="https://discuss-cdn.tryton.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/b/b4f65d54dfdcaf99d56bd8d469994928f2ef2acb_2_487x500.png" width="487" /></a></div><p></p>
<p>A simple chat widget has been added on the sidebar in beta.<br />
It allows to chat in live between users on specific document.</p>
<p></p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://discuss-cdn.tryton.org/uploads/default/original/2X/f/fde9976dabf0cc2f0b3365a2ee4af559d965f98e.png" title="Chat on a sale order between Jim, Dwight and Michael"><img alt="Chat on a sale order between Jim, Dwight and Michael" height="350" src="https://discuss-cdn.tryton.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/f/fde9976dabf0cc2f0b3365a2ee4af559d965f98e_2_690x350.png" width="690" /></a></div><p></p>
<p>When saving a CSV export, the option to ignore the search limit is now stored also on the server.</p>
<h4 id="heading--user-client-web">Web</h4>
<p>It is now possible to resize the column widths (like on the desktop client).</p>
<h3 id="heading--user-accounting">Accounting</h3>
<p>As creating payment term is not always easy, we provide now by default the most common payment terms like “Net 30 days”, “Net 30 days End of Month” etc.</p>
<p>The legacy numbering of account move based on journal has been removed and the <em>Post Number</em> field has been renamed to <em>Number</em>.<br />
Also the numbering of account move is using now a strict sequence to guarantee any missing number.</p>
<p>The sign of the amount of account and analytic budgets has been inverted to be the same as the income statements.</p>
<p>The Spanish AEAT reports are not using a start and end periods instead of a list which may not be continuous.</p>
<p>Depending on the payment method, it is no more always needed to group payments to process them. For example, Stripe and Braintree payments do not create a payment group as they are managed individually.</p>
<p>It is now possible to download all the SEPA message at once.</p>
<p>When entering manually, the statement is using its start date to compute the start balance instead of balance of the last statement. This is useful if for some reasons, you are not entering the statements in the chronological order.</p>
<p>We added a new report displaying each statement journal with its latest date and balance.</p>
<p>It is now possible to order by custom preferences the bank account of a party. This is usefull for defining payment bank account as Tryton always pick the first one by default.</p>
<h3 id="heading--user-sale">Sale</h3>
<p>We manage now the expiration of quotation. A validity duration can be configured for the quotations. It is not possible to confirm a quotation with a sale date after the expiration date. When a quotation reaches its expiration without being confirmed, it will be automatically cancelled.</p>
<p>It is now possible to open a list of all the products from a sale order. This is useful for example to verify the available quantities at once.</p>
<p>A new action has been added to the complaint to create automatically a coupon number from a promotion. It is a common practice to answer to customer complaint by giving them such coupon. This feature prevents to give the access right to create coupon to the user managing the complaints.</p>
<p>The actual quantity of the sale line is now used when processing a complaint instead of the ordered quantity.</p>
<p>We added on the sale the original amount and total before any promotion was applied. This is useful if you want to show those amount to the customer.</p>
<p>We added a menu entry to open all the coupon numbers of promotion. This eases the management when you have a lot of coupon numbers.</p>
<p>Now if a secondary unit is defined on the product customer, then it is filled automatically on the sale line.</p>
<h3 id="heading--user-purchase">Purchase</h3>
<p>A date has been added to the purchase orders to store when the quotation will expire. This improves the following of quotations before they expire.</p>
<p>Now if a secondary unit is defined on the product supplier, then it is filled automatically on the purchase line.</p>
<h3 id="heading--user-stock">Stock</h3>
<p>We display the quantity of product when searching for a location; product or lot from a stock move.</p>
<p>The internal shipment gains a packed state when it is between two warehouses. This way we support also to create packages and shipping labels for such shipment.<br />
We also compute the measurements for the internal shipments as needed for some carrier.</p>
<p>The location place is now displayed on inventory line to help finding the products in the location.</p>
<h3 id="heading--user-company">Company</h3>
<p>It is now possible to define which tax identifier to use for a company per country and/or organization. For example a Belgian company with a Belgian VAT may have a French VAT number when doing business in France.</p>
<h3 id="heading--user-country">Country</h3>
<p>Tryton can now search subdivision by their shorted code. This provides a better user experience as the full subdivision codes are often prefixed with the country code that the user usually do no type.</p>
<h3 id="heading--user-incoterm">Incoterm</h3>
<p>We do not require anymore the Incoterm for sale between European countries.</p>
<h3 id="heading--user-notification">Notification</h3>
<p>It is now allowed to set a fallback user on notification without a field set. So the user is always notified.</p>
<h3 id="heading--user-party">Party</h3>
<p>We support now to enter structured address (with entries for the street name, building number, post box etc), then such address will be formatted following its country. We include in standard the format of 222 countries.</p>
<p></p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://discuss-cdn.tryton.org/uploads/default/original/2X/e/e086c63ac204db21a76595ef160e711ee8c9e759.png" title="Party form showing address filled with structured data"><img alt="Party form showing address filled with structured data" height="350" src="https://discuss-cdn.tryton.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/e/e086c63ac204db21a76595ef160e711ee8c9e759_2_690x350.png" width="690" /></a></div><p></p>
<p>We notify the user if he is about to create a contact mechanism that already exists.</p>
<p>We added new tax identifiers such as the Brazilian Company Identifier, the Canadian Business Number and the Croatian Identification Number.</p>
<h3 id="heading--user-web-shop">Web Shop</h3>
<p>On Shopify, we archive products that are removed from the shop instead of deleting them. This way if they are added back, we do not loose any customization done in Shopify admin.<br />
In the same way, we do not update the product description if it is empty so they can be fully managed in Shopify admin.</p>
<h2 id="heading--sysadmin">Changes for the System Administrator</h2>
<h3 id="heading--sysadmin-web-user">Web User</h3>
<p>We allow users of the *Party Administrator" group to edit web users.</p>
<h2 id="heading--developer">Changes for the Developer</h2>
<h3 id="heading--developer-server">Server</h3>
<p>To follow the official supported Python version, the support of Python 3.13 has been added and support of Python 3.8 has been removed.</p>
<p>We lock now records at the transaction start like for the table.</p>
<p>We include a <code>DecimalNull</code> in the tools that behaves  like the SQL NULL by with <code>Decimal</code>.</p>
<p>We introduce a chat backend as beta.</p>
<p><code>Transaction.check_warnings</code> is now a dictionary used to delete warnings all at once at the end of the transaction.</p>
<p>The target model of a field is now stored in <code>ir.model.field</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>ModelStorage</code> has been reworked to add dedicate hooks that replace and simplify in many cases the need to extend the <code>create</code>, <code>write</code> and <code>delete</code> methods. There is now:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>preprocess_values</code>: to prepare the values before <code>create</code> or <code>write</code></li>
<li><code>on_modification</code> : to trigger processes when some records and fields have been modified</li>
<li><code>check_modification</code>: to verify if a modification is permitted</li>
<li><code>on_write</code>: to set methods to be called once the records have been modified</li>
<li><code>on_delete</code>: to set methods to be called once the records have been deleted</li>
</ul>
<p>And there is now a <code>ModelStorage.compute_fields</code> method used to store new values for computed fields.<br />
All those changes allowed to remove almost all the extension of the CWD methods reducing the complexity and improve the performance.</p>
<p>The select timeout for the cache channels is now configurable.</p>
<p>The series of <code>trytond</code> is now stored in the database. This allows the server to prevent to use by mistake a database from a different series.</p>
<p>The wizard state views are now filled with the default values. This removes the need to use <code>getattr</code> with a default value.</p>
<p>As <code>passlib</code> does not support Python 3.13, it has been replaced by <code>pwdlib</code>.</p>
<p>It is now possible to limit the size of the RPC arguments. All the standard RPC methods have been reviewed to add such limitation when it makes sense.</p>
<p>The <code>field_names</code> argument is now optional when calling <code>Model.default_get</code>.</p>
<p>The XML data are now always synchronized with the database. So the <code>ModelStorage.check_xml_record</code> method has been removed.</p>
<p>When searching on <code>Char</code> and <code>Text</code>, the <code>None</code> values are converted as empty string which is the expected behavior by users.</p>
<p>It is now allowed to return instances as default values instead of id. The server will convert them automatically into ids for the client.</p>
<p>The metadata columns are now added automatically to the query of the <code>ModelSQL.table_query</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>Report.header_key</code> receive now also the <code>data</code> on which the report is executed. This permits to group records based on data from a wizard for example.</p>
<p>The integer part of the <code>digits</code> attribute is now also validated by the server.</p>
<p>We added the support for <code>DATE_TRUNC</code> and <code>EXTRACT</code> from <code>INTERVAL</code> to the SQLite backend.</p>
<p>Tryton now supports up to 4 translations depending on the plural setup of the language.</p>
<p>The methods <code>msg_gettext</code> and <code>msg_ngettext</code> are now available in the report context.</p>
<p>Tryton set the Decimal precision of the default context from the <code>TRYTOND_DECIMAL_PREC</code> environment variable.</p>
<p>We replaced the use of docstring of <code>Model</code> by a <code>__string__</code> attribute filled with a default value based on the <code>__name__</code> value. This allow to run the server with the level 2 of optimization of Python.<br />
The <code>name</code> field of <code>ir.model</code> has been renamed into <code>string</code> and <code>model</code> into <code>name</code> and the <code>field_description</code> of <code>ir.model.field</code> into <code>string</code>.</p>
<h3 id="heading--developer-proteus">Proteus</h3>
<p>We added an helper function <code>launch_action</code> which allow to launch an action on a lits of records using its XML ID. This ease writing scenario to test those actions.</p>
<h3 id="heading--developer--client">Client</h3>
<p>A new <code>color</code>  widget type has been added for the icon and image fields.</p>
<h3 id="heading--developer-accounting">Accounting</h3>
<p>A <code>company</code> argument has been added to method to check the credit limit to be explicit for which company is the amount it checked instead of relying on the contextual value.</p>
<p>The <code>description</code> field on payment has been renamed into <code>reference</code> to follow the Tryton naming convention and reflect the actual usage.</p>
<p>The Stripe checkout is now using the <a href="https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element">Payment Element</a>.</p>
<h3 id="heading--developer-party">Party</h3>
<p>The <code>name</code> field of address has been rename to <code>building_name</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>co_rut</code> tax identifier has been replaced by <code>co_nit</code>.</p>
<h3 id="heading--developer-sale">Sale</h3>
<p>We have added a scheduled task to confirm sales based on payment. This is to strengthen the process in case the payment is succeeded and the sale can not yet be confirmed.</p>
<p>We removed the <code>name</code> field on the promotion coupon.</p>

            Pandas is at a the core of virtually all data science done in Python, that is virtually all data science. Since it's beginning, Pandas has been based upon numpy. But changes are afoot to update those internals and you can now optionally use PyArrow. PyArrow comes with a ton of benefits including it's columnar format which makes answering analytical questions faster, support for a range of high performance file formats, inter-machine data streaming, faster file IO and more. Reuven Lerner is here to give us the low-down on the PyArrow revolution.

            <p>Kivy is a powerful framework for developing multi-touch GUI applications using Python. It provides a set of rich built-in widgets which you can use to build complex GUI applications.</p>
<p>In a previous tutorial we covered the <a href="/tutorials/kivy-ux-widgets/">basic Kivy widgets</a> such as text inputs, buttons and checkboxes. In this tutorial, we will take things further, exploring some more of the more complex widgets that Kivy provides. These include: <code>Bubble</code>, <code>DropDown</code>, <code>FileChooser</code>, <code>Popup</code>, <code>Spinner</code>, <code>RecycleView</code>, <code>TabbedPanel</code>, <code>VideoPlayer</code>, and <code>VKeyboard</code>. With them, you can add advanced features to your Kivy apps.</p>

<h2 id="writing-an-outline-kivy-app">Writing an Outline Kivy App</h2>
<p>We'll start this tutorial with a simple application skeleton, which we will then modify below. Save the following code in a file named <code>app.py</code>:</p>

        <div class="code-block">
        <span class="code-block-language code-block-python">python</span>
        <pre><code class="python">from kivy.app import App
from kivy.core.window import Window
from kivy.uix.boxlayout import BoxLayout

class WidgetNameApp(App):
    title = "WidgetName Widget"

    def build(self):
        Window.clearcolor = (0, 0.31, 0.31, 1.0)
        Window.size = (360, 640)

        root = BoxLayout()

        return root

WidgetNameApp().run()
</code></pre>
        </div>
        
<p>Here, we've created a Kivy application with an empty window. The <code>BoxLayout</code> acts as the root widget, this will act as the container to add our complex widgets to. The <code>build()</code> method sets the window's background color to a dark teal shade and adjusts the window size to 360x640 pixels, which is a mobile-friendly size.</p>

<h2 id="providing-option-selections-with-spinner">Providing Option Selections With <code>Spinner</code></h2>
<p>The <code>Spinner</code> is a dropdown selector that allows users to choose one option from multiple choices. This is ideal when working with a list of simple text choices. Below is an example that builds a <code>Spinner</code> that lets you select from different parts of this website.</p>

        <div class="code-block">
        <span class="code-block-language code-block-python">python</span>
        <pre><code class="python">from kivy.app import App
from kivy.core.window import Window
from kivy.uix.floatlayout import FloatLayout
from kivy.uix.spinner import Spinner

class SpinnerApp(App):
    title = "Spinner Widget"

    def build(self):
        Window.clearcolor = (0, 0.31, 0.31, 1.0)
        Window.size = (300, 300)

        root = FloatLayout()

        # Create the Spinner
        spinner = Spinner(
            text="Home",
            values=("Home", "Latest", "FAQ", "Forum", "Contact", "About"),
            size_hint=(None, None),
            size=(200, 70),
            pos_hint={"center_x": 0.2, "center_y": 0.9},
            sync_height=True,
        )

        root.add_widget(spinner)

        return root

SpinnerApp().run()
</code></pre>
        </div>
        
<p>The <code>Spinner</code> widget works as a simple dropdown list, allowing users to select one option from multiple text choices. We've set the <code>Spinner</code> to start with <code>"Home"</code> as the default <code>text</code> and provided other options (<code>"Latest"</code>, <code>"FAQ"</code>, <code>"Forum"</code>, <code>"Contact"</code>, and <code>"About"</code>) as a list of values.</p>
<p class="admonition admonition-note"><span class="admonition-kind"><i class="fas fa-sticky-note"></i></span>  You need to repeat the <code>"Home"</code> option in <code>values</code> so that you don't lose it when you select another option.</p>
<p class="admonition admonition-run"><span class="admonition-kind"><i class="fas fa-rocket"></i></span>  <strong>Run it!</strong> You'll get an app that looks as shown below.</p>

<p>The dropdown spinner allows users to select from predefined choices. You can use this widget to create elements that work like dropdown list, optimizing space and providing a clean UI.</p>
<h2 id="providing-options-with-dropdown-list">Providing Options With <code>DropDown</code> List</h2>
<p>The <code>DropDown</code> widget provides a more complex menu component that allows users to choose from multiple options. Like spinner, this provides an intuitive way for users to select from a set of choices, but here you can display more than just text. This makes it more complex to use, but allows for more flexibility.</p>
<p>Below is an example of using the widget to create a dropdown list that lets you select your favorite GUI library, displayed on a series of <code>Button</code> objects.</p>

        <div class="code-block">
        <span class="code-block-language code-block-python">python</span>

    title = "DropDown Widget"

    def build(self):
        Window.clearcolor = (0, 0.31, 0.31, 1.0)
        Window.size = (200, 200)

        root = BoxLayout(orientation="vertical", padding=10, spacing=10)

        # Create a dropdown with 4 buttons
        dropdown = DropDown()
        for item in ["Kivy", "PyQt6", "PySide6", "Tkinter"]:
            option_btn = Button(text=item, size_hint_y=None, height=50, width=150)
            option_btn.bind(on_release=lambda btn: dropdown.select(btn.text))
            dropdown.add_widget(option_btn)

        # Create a main button to show the dropdown
        button = Button(
            text="Library",

            size=(150, 50),
        )
        button.bind(on_release=dropdown.open)
        dropdown.bind(

<p>In this example, we have a <code>DropDown</code> widget that lets the user to select a library from a list of options. You populate the dropdown with four options <code>"Kivy"</code>, <a href="https://www.pythonguis.com/pyqt6/"><code>"PyQt6"</code></a>, <a href="https://www.pythonguis.com/pyside6/"><code>"PySide6"</code></a>, and <a href="https://www.pythonguis.com/tkinter/"><code>"Tkinter"</code></a>, which are displayed in <code>Button</code> objects.</p>
<p>We set each button to trigger the <code>dropdown.select()</code> method when clicked, passing the button's text as the selected value.</p>
<p>Then, we anchor the dropdown to a <em>Library</em> button. When we press the <em>Library</em> button, the dropdown menu opens, displaying the options. Once we select an option, the <code>on_select</code> event updates the main button's text to reflect the chosen library.</p>

<h2 id="accessing-files-with-filechooser">Accessing Files With <code>FileChooser*</code></h2>
<p>The <code>filechooser</code> module provides classes for describing, displaying and browsing file systems. In this module there are two ready-made widget views which present the file system as either a list, or as icons. The example below demonstrates these both in action.</p>

        <div class="code-block">
        <span class="code-block-language code-block-python">python</span>

    def build(self):
        Window.clearcolor = (0, 0.31, 0.31, 1.0)
        Window.size = (360, 640)

        root = BoxLayout(orientation="vertical")

        # Create icon-view and list-view file choosers
        filechooser_icons = FileChooserIconView()
        filechooser_list = FileChooserListView()

        root.add_widget(filechooser_icons)
        root.add_widget(filechooser_list)

        return root

FileChooserApp().run()
</code></pre>
        </div>
        
<p>In this example, we create file chooser widgets to browse and select files using two different views:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Icon view</strong> (<code>FileChooserIconView</code>)</li>
<li><strong>List view</strong> (<code>FileChooserListView</code>)</li>
</ol>
<p>The icon view displays files as wrapped rows of icons, clicking on a folder icon will navigate down into that folder. The list view presents them in a list-tree like format, where clicking on a folder will show files and folders nested under it.</p>
<p class="admonition admonition-run"><span class="admonition-kind"><i class="fas fa-rocket"></i></span>  <strong>Run it!</strong> On macOS, you'll see a window that looks something like the following. Try clicking on the folder icons and entries in the list view to see how navigation works in the two examples.</p>

<h2 id="building-quick-dialogs-with-popup">Building Quick Dialogs With <code>Popup</code></h2>
<p>The <code>Popup</code> widget allows us to display modal dialogs with custom content, layouts and widgets. They can be used to show messages or ask for input. The following popup message displays a simple message, with a title, message and OK button.</p>

        <div class="code-block">

        layout = BoxLayout(orientation="vertical", spacing=10, padding=10)

        message = Label(text="Hello, World!")

        ok_button = Button(text="OK", size_hint=(None, None), size=(80, 40))

        popup.open()

PopupApp().run()
</code></pre>
        </div>
        
<p>In this example, you create a <code>Popup</code> widget that displays information as a modal dialog. When the user clicks the <em>Open Popup</em> button, the <code>show_popup()</code> method is triggered, creating a <code>Popup</code> that occupies 60% of the screen in both directions.</p>
<p>We set <code>auto_dismiss</code> to <code>False</code>, which means the popup won't close if we click outside of it. The popup contains the <code>Hello, World!</code> message and an <em>OK</em> button. When we click the button, we dismiss (close) the popup. Popups are effective for displaying alerts, confirmations, or other information in a Kivy app.</p>
<p class="admonition admonition-run"><span class="admonition-kind"><i class="fas fa-rocket"></i></span>  <strong>Run it!</strong> You'll get a window with a button labeled "Open Popup". Click on the <em>Open Popup</em> button to display the popup window.</p>

<h2 id="creating-contextual-popups-with-bubble">Creating Contextual Popups With <code>Bubble</code></h2>
<p>The <code>Bubble</code> widget is a UI element commonly used for contextual popups, tooltips, or chat applications. Below is a quick Kivy application that shows some text and lets you click on it to change its format. We'll start by importing the necessary objects and subclassing the <code>Bubble</code> class:</p>

</code></pre>
        </div>
        
<p>The <code>FormattingBubble</code> class inherits from <code>Bubble</code> and provides text formatting options for a label. It initializes with a specific size, arrow position, and horizontal layout. The bubble will contain two buttons: <em>Bold</em> and <em>Italic</em>. When pressed, these buttons apply the respective formatting to the target text by triggering the <code>on_format()</code> method. This method wraps the text in Kivy's markup tags <code>[b]...[/b]</code> for bold and <code>[i]...[/i]</code> for italic.</p>
<p>The <code>BubbleApp</code> class represents the Kivy application. It sets up a <code>FloatLayout</code> with a centered <code>Label</code> displaying a message. When the user taps the label, the <code>show_bubble()</code> method creates and positions a <code>FormattingBubble</code> above the tapped location.</p>
<p>The app also ensures that only one bubble is visible at a time by removing existing ones before showing a new one. Additionally, tapping outside the label dismisses any active bubbles using the <code>dismiss_bubbles()</code> method.</p>
<p class="admonition admonition-run"><span class="admonition-kind"><i class="fas fa-rocket"></i></span>  <strong>Run it!</strong> The app features a dark teal background and a mobile-friendly window size. The <code>Bubble</code> widget appears when we click the text.</p>

<h2 id="displaying-data-with-recycleview">Displaying Data With <code>RecycleView</code></h2>
<p>The <code>RecycleView</code> widget efficiently displays data by recycling views or graphical elements. Instead of creating a widget for every item in the dataset, <code>RecycleView</code> reuses a small number of widgets to display visible items only, improving performance.</p>
<p>To illustrate, let's create a view that lets you inspect a database of employee profiles. The data is stored in a CSV file that looks like the following:</p>

        <div class="code-block">
        <span class="code-block-language code-block-csv">csv</span>

</code></pre>
        </div>
        
<p>You can read and load this data with the <code>csv</code> module. To visualize the data, you can create a view with the <code>RecycleView</code> widget. For the individual views, you can use the <code>Button</code> widget, which will let you display the employee's profile:</p>

<p>In this example, we subclass <code>RecycleView</code> to display the list of employees loaded from a CSV file. The <code>_read_from_csv()</code> method opens the file and reads the data using the <code>csv.DictReader()</code> class, which converts each CSV line into a dictionary whose keys come from the file header line.</p>
<p>The <code>data</code> attribute is key for the app to work because it'll hold the data that we want to display. To arrange widgets in a <code>RecycleView</code>, we use a <code>RecycleBoxLayout</code>. The <code>viewclass</code> attribute lets us set the widget that we'll use to display each data item.</p>
<p class="admonition admonition-warning"><span class="admonition-kind"><i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i></span>  It's important to note that for the <code>RecycleView</code> to work properly, we should set <code>viewclass</code> at the end when the data is already loaded and the layout is set up.</p>
<p>Then, we populate the <code>RecycleView</code> view with buttons, each displaying an employee's name. Clicking a button triggers <code>_create_callback()</code>, which generates a callback that opens a popup displaying the selected employee's profile details.</p>
<p class="admonition admonition-run"><span class="admonition-kind"><i class="fas fa-rocket"></i></span>  <strong>Run it!</strong> You'll get a nice-looking window listing the employees. Click a button to view the associated employee's profile. Scroll down to load more profiles.</p>

Below is a short app that demonstrates a virtual keyboard in action. When you type text using the keyboard, it is displayed on the label.</p>

<p>In this example, we manually add a virtual keyboard to our app's interface using the <code>VKeyboard</code> widget and display typed text using a label.</p>
<p>When a key is released, the <code>keyboard_on_key_up()</code> method processes the input. Printable characters are appended to the label text. Backspace removes the last character, and the spacebar inserts a space.</p>
<p class="admonition admonition-note"><span class="admonition-kind"><i class="fas fa-sticky-note"></i></span>  You typically wouldn't use the <code>VKeyboard</code> widget as in the example above. Input widgets, like <code>TextInput</code>, will automatically bring up the virtual keyboard when focused on mobile devices.</p>
<p>We ignore special keys like <em>Enter</em>, <em>Shift</em>, <em>Alt</em>, <em>Ctrl</em>, and <em>Escape</em>. This allows us to interact with a virtual keyboard and see the input displayed dynamically in the label.</p>
<p class="admonition admonition-run"><span class="admonition-kind"><i class="fas fa-rocket"></i></span>  <strong>Run it!</strong> A virtual keyboard appears at the button of the app's window, allowing you to enter text in touch-based devices. When you type on the virtual keyboard at the bottom of the app's window, the label reflects what you've typed.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Kivy provides a rich set of complex UX widgets that you can use to create cross-platform applications. Using the examples above as inspiration you should now be able to use <code>Bubble</code>, <code>DropDown</code>, <code>FileChooser</code>, <code>Popup</code>, <code>Spinner</code>, <code>RecycleView</code>, <code>TabbedPanel</code>, and <code>VKeyboard</code> in your own apps. See if you can extend these examples further, adding more widgets or functionality to them.</p>

            <p>Django is experimenting with a new GitHub repository specifically designed to manage feature ideas and their progression. This is a significant shift away from the previous process of posting those to the forum.</p>
<h3 id="s-introducing-the-django-features-repository">Introducing the Django Features Repository</h3>
<p>The Django Steering Council has launched a new GitHub repository, <a href="https://github.com/django/new-features">django/new-features</a> dedicated to managing feature requests and ideas. This repository works in conjunction with a <a href="https://github.com/orgs/django/projects/24">GitHub project</a> to provide more efficient tracking of feature ideas as they move through various stages of consideration.</p>
<h3 id="s-why-this-matters-for-django-developers">Why This Matters for Django Developers</h3>
<p>This new approach aims to addresses several challenges the Django community has faced with feature requests:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Community involvement</strong>: Clear guidelines on how to participate in feature discussions</li>
<li><strong>Structured workflow</strong>: A defined path from idea to implementation</li>
<li><strong>Better resource allocation</strong>: Prioritization based on community support and feasibility</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="s-the-new-feature-process-flow">The New Feature Process Flow</h3>
<p>The process follows a workflow with several key decision points:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>New Idea Submission</strong>: Community members submit feature ideas as GitHub issues</li>
<li><strong>Community Support Phase</strong>: The community reacts with emojis and comments to express support or concerns</li>
<li><strong>Evaluation for Core Inclusion</strong>: The Steering Council determines if the feature belongs in Django core or whether it is more appropriate as a 3rd party package</li>
<li><strong>Implementation Planning</strong>: Through an expedited DEP (Django Enhancement Proposal) process</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="s-how-to-participate">How to Participate</h3>
<h4 id="s-have-a-feature-idea">Have a Feature Idea?</h4>
<p>If you have an idea for improving Django, the process starts by creating an issue in the new repository. Before submitting, review the new feature process documentation to understand what to expect.</p>
<h4 id="s-want-to-help-shape-djangos-future">Want to Help Shape Django's Future?</h4>
<p>There are three key areas where community involvement is needed:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Community Support Assessment</strong>: Review open tickets and share your support using emoji reactions
<ul>
<li>👍 For features you would use</li>
<li>👎 For features that might cause problems</li>
<li>😕 For features you're indifferent about</li>
<li>🎉 For easy wins</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><strong>Core Evaluation</strong>: Help determine whether features should exist in Django core or as third-party packages
</li>
<li><strong>Implementation Volunteering</strong>: Assist with implementing, reviewing implementations, and maintenance of approved features
</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="s-benefits-for-the-django-community">Benefits for the Django Community</h3>
<p>We believe this new process can help with:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clearer communication</strong>: Understanding where a feature stands in the process</li>
<li><strong>More efficient feature development</strong>: Resources directed to features with demonstrated community support</li>
<li><strong>Better separation of concerns</strong>: Distinguishing between features that belong in core versus those better suited as third-party packages</li>
<li><strong>Reduced friction</strong>: Expedited processes for smaller feature requests</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="s-providing-feedback">Providing Feedback</h3>
<p>If you have thoughts about the new process itself, we'd love to get feedback through the <a href="https://forum.djangoproject.com/t/announcing-django-new-features-project/40658">Django Forum</a>.</p>
<h3 id="s-conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>The <strong>experimental</strong> new feature repository represents is one of several steps Django is taking in order to try and improve the contributor experience journey. By providing a structured, transparent process for feature requests, Django aims to better serve its community while maintaining the framework's quality and sustainability.</p>
<p>For developers interested in contributing to Django or proposing new features, this new system should provide clearer expectations while making it easier to locate and participate in the discussion around a specific feature.</p>
