            <p>Security and integrity of the Python packaging ecosystem is critical, and the smallest unit of a packaging ecosystem is a "package". Python packages use existing archive formats like ZIP and tar to distribute Python projects to their users. Archives seem simple on the surface, but many ZIP and tar features can be abused to confuse implementations into seeing different contents of the same archive.</p><p>These vulnerabilities affect the "integrity of the ecosystem" if tools can't agree what a package contents actually are. This can cause many downstream issues, such as vulnerability or malware scanners giving different results from the package when installed on disk.</p><p>The Python Software Foundation Security Developer-in-Residence, Seth Larson, <a href="https://alpha-omega.dev/blog/slippery-zips-and-sticky-tar-pits-security-and-archives-white-paper-by-seth-larson-python-software-foundation/">published a new white paper</a> with <a href="https://alpha-omega.dev">Alpha-Omega</a>&nbsp;titled "Slippery ZIPs and Sticky tar-pits: Security &amp; Archives" about work to remediate 10 vulnerabilities affecting common archive format implementations such as ZIP and tar for critical Python projects.</p><p>The white paper highlights how the PSF maintained&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.pypi.org/#preventing-zip-parser-confusion-attacks-on-python-package-installers">Python Package Index</a> (PyPI) can be used to protect insecure implementations of archives preemptively, whether their vulnerability status is known or unknown, by coordinating disclosures with other packaging tools.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh7uiJDZclfRKPtofLwbfd89GFQRL3MnbbhNGZ75p6Up0EBZR10s5OjLUmFqPFKyGWQHn1cJuZlrOlmG3Il7iVaCPXa47fcQGDnsoCxRw1r5KM5s9oJC-YlkVT9gHit9gFjQsq9Eg8p3z3xqs2tgAgvnKWdWEoBPuo0L8duCrKhqVD9KILdvQ/s1337/zip-file.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="Diagram showing how a file can be prepended to a ZIP archive and be read differently depending on whether the original file or ZIP header is read first." border="0" height="214" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh7uiJDZclfRKPtofLwbfd89GFQRL3MnbbhNGZ75p6Up0EBZR10s5OjLUmFqPFKyGWQHn1cJuZlrOlmG3Il7iVaCPXa47fcQGDnsoCxRw1r5KM5s9oJC-YlkVT9gHit9gFjQsq9Eg8p3z3xqs2tgAgvnKWdWEoBPuo0L8duCrKhqVD9KILdvQ/w400-h214/zip-file.png" width="400" /></a></div><br /><p></p><p>The white paper details potential future work to shore up the security of ZIP and tar implementations that are in widespread use, such as the zipfile and tarfile module in the Python standard library.

            <p>Last night was a <a href="https://about.bostonpython.com/" rel="external noopener">Boston Python project night</a> where I
had a good conversation with a few people that was mostly guided by questions
from a nice guy named Mark.</p><h1 id="h_how_to_write_nice_code_in_research">How to write nice code in research<a class="headerlink" href="#h_how_to_write_nice_code_in_research"></a></h1><p>Mark works in research and made the classic observation that research code is
often messy, and asked about how to make it nicer.</p><p>I pointed out that for software engineers, the code is the product. For
research, the results are the product, so there&#8217;s a reason the code can be and
often is messier.  It&#8217;s important to keep the goal in mind. I mentioned it might
not be worth it to add type annotations, detailed docstrings, or whatever else
would make the code &#8220;nice&#8221;.</p><p>But the more you can make &#8220;nice&#8221; a habit, the less work it will be to do it
as a matter of course. Even in a result-driven research environment, you&#8217;ll be
able to write code the way you want, or at least push back a little bit. Code
usually lives longer than people expect, so the nicer you can make it,
the better it will be.</p><h1 id="h_side_projects">Side projects<a class="headerlink" href="#h_side_projects"></a></h1><p>Side projects are a good opportunity to work differently. If work means messy
code, your side project could be pristine. If work is very strict, your side
project can be thrown together just for fun.  You get to set the goals.</p><p>And different side projects can be different. I develop
<a href="https://coverage.readthedocs.io" rel="external noopener">coverage.py</a> very differently
than <a href="https://nedbatchelder.com/blog/202510/natural_cubics_circular_simplex.html">fun math art
projects</a>. Coverage.py has an extensive test suite run on many versions of
Python (including nightly builds of the tip of main).  The math art projects
usually have no tests at all.</p><p>Side projects are a great place to decide how you want to code and to
practice that style.  Later you can bring those skills and learnings back to a
work environment.</p><h1 id="h_forgive_yourself">Forgive yourself<a class="headerlink" href="#h_forgive_yourself"></a></h1><p>Mark said one of his difficulties with side projects is perfectionism. He&#8217;ll
come back to a project and find he wants to rewrite the whole thing.</p><p>My advice is: forgive yourself.  It&#8217;s OK to rewrite the whole thing. It&#8217;s OK
to not rewrite the whole thing. It&#8217;s OK to ignore it for months at a time.  It&#8217;s
OK to stop in the middle of a project and never come back to it. It&#8217;s OK to
obsess about &#8220;irrelevant&#8221; details.</p><p>The great thing about a side project is that you are the only person who
decides what and how it should be.</p><h1 id="h_how_to_stay_motivated">How to stay motivated<a class="headerlink" href="#h_how_to_stay_motivated"></a></h1><p>But how to stay motivated on side projects? For me, it&#8217;s very motivating that
many people use and get value from coverage.py. It&#8217;s a service to the community
that I find rewarding.  Other side projects will have other motivations: a
chance to learn new things, flex different muscles, stretch myself in new
ways.</p><p>Find a reason that motivates you, and structure your side projects to lean
into that reason. Don&#8217;t forget to forgive yourself if it doesn&#8217;t work out the
way you planned or if you change your mind.</p><h1 id="h_how_to_write_something_people_will_use">How to write something people will use<a class="headerlink" href="#h_how_to_write_something_people_will_use"></a></h1><p>Sure, it&#8217;s great to have a project that many people use, but how do you find
a project that will end up like that?  The best way is to write something that
you find useful. Then talk about it with people.  You never know what will catch
on.</p><p>I mentioned my <a href="https://pypi.org/project/cogapp/" rel="external noopener">cog</a> project,
which I first wrote in 2004 for one reason, but which is now being used by other
people (including me) for different purposes.  It
<a href="https://nedbatchelder.com/blog/202201/cog_resurgence.html">took years to catch on</a>.</p><p>Of course there&#8217;s no guarantee something like that will happen: it most
likely won&#8217;t.  But I don&#8217;t know of a better way to make something people will
use than to start by making something that <em>you</em> will use.</p><h1 id="h_other_topics">Other topics<a class="headerlink" href="#h_other_topics"></a></h1><p>The discussion wasn&#8217;t as linear as this. We touched on other things along the
way: unit tests vs system tests, obligations to support old versions of
software, how to navigate huge code bases. There were probably other tangents
that I&#8217;ve forgotten.</p><p>Project nights are almost never just about projects: they are about
connecting with people in lots of different ways. This discussion felt like a
good connection.  I hope the ideas of choosing your own paths and forgiving
yourself hit home.</p>

            <p>In September, the Python Software Foundation (PSF) co-signed the <a href="https://openssf.org/blog/2025/09/23/open-infrastructure-is-not-free-a-joint-statement-on-sustainable-stewardship/" target="_blank">Open Infrastructure is Not Free: A Joint Statement on Sustainable Stewardship Letter</a> published by the <a href="https://openssf.org" target="_blank">Open Source Security Foundation</a> (OpenSSF) as a steward of the <a href="https://pypi.org" target="_blank">Python Package Index</a> (PyPI). As a follow up, I would like to share a bit more about the concerns expressed in this letter as they relate to our community and the PSF.<br /></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">History and Current Conditions</h2><p>PyPI (and Python) have continued to experience effectively exponential growth in usage over the past decade, from October 2018 to the present. This is clear in our telemetry:&nbsp;</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEikRtqvW0-U1lpe8glltzrF71lqUD-GVjlT-5xf31OOEWT0KnjX0fKlGCCDs4LV1B-gqaSvbZtwSXLdGWquTEotZ57o9Mhfyphd3zLLEViwuZVHBBa_cJg9rxMx8raOIHTMH_l88n1F5a5JKaewAVkgGh-S4nsNuj1x8GRrv6IuN188LCQqRQ/s512/pypi_dailyrequestsovertime.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="149" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEikRtqvW0-U1lpe8glltzrF71lqUD-GVjlT-5xf31OOEWT0KnjX0fKlGCCDs4LV1B-gqaSvbZtwSXLdGWquTEotZ57o9Mhfyphd3zLLEViwuZVHBBa_cJg9rxMx8raOIHTMH_l88n1F5a5JKaewAVkgGh-S4nsNuj1x8GRrv6IuN188LCQqRQ/w400-h149/pypi_dailyrequestsovertime.png" width="400" /></a><i>&nbsp;</i></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-size: x-small;">Daily requests over time for PyPI's services, showing a trend line starting in 2018 in the millions, reaching 2-3 billion per day at present.</span></i></div><p>This growth has been met with persistent and growing investment by the PSF. Starting with the hire of a full-time Director of Infrastructure in June 2018, as well as ongoing costs associated with operating PyPI and managing relationships, grants, and sponsorships that support it.<br /><br />At present, the PSF employs personnel and pays operational costs to keep PyPI online, reliable, secure, and supported to meet the <a href="https://openssf.org/blog/2025/09/23/open-infrastructure-is-not-free-a-joint-statement-on-sustainable-stewardship/#:~:text=Modern%20Expectations,%20Real%20Infrastructure" target="_blank">modern expectations</a> of the Python community globally. While we are very fortunate to have long-term partnerships with <a href="https://www.fastly.com/fast-forward" target="_blank">Fastly</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/opensource/" target="_blank">Amazon Web Services</a>, <a href="https://opensource.google" target="_blank">Google Cloud</a>, <a href="https://opensource.datadoghq.com" target="_blank">Datadog</a>, <a href="https://open.sentry.io" target="_blank">Sentry</a>, <a href="https://depot.dev/changelog" target="_blank">depot</a>, and <a href="https://www.pagerduty.com/impact-hub/" target="_blank">PagerDuty</a> that help us to develop, test, host, operate, monitor, and respond to incidents for PyPI, we still pay monthly fees for things like our support inboxes and other infrastructure.<br /><br />The largest cost for the PSF is staffing. The PSF staff who support PyPI include:</p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Ee Durbin (myself), Director of Infrastructure</li><li>Jacob Coffee, Infrastructure Engineer</li><li>Maria Ashna, PyPI Support Specialist</li><li>Mike Fiedler, PyPI Safety and Security Engineer</li></ul><p>While our Safety and Security Engineer role is funded via a grant from <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org" target="_blank">The Linux Foundation’s</a> <a href="https://alpha-omega.dev/grants/grantrecipients/" target="_blank">Alpha-Omega</a> project, all others are paid for from the PSF’s general fund, which comes from our <a href="https://www.python.org/sponsors/application/" target="_blank">sponsorship program</a> and <a href="https://psfmember.org/civicrm/contribute/transact/?reset=1&amp;id=2" target="_blank">individual contributions</a>.<br /><br />These roles ensure that the expectations of our community are met when it comes to reliability and availability of the infrastructure and systems that run PyPI. They also ensure responsiveness to both critical support concerns, such as account recovery and project ownership, and to security incidents and malware, as well as continuing improvements to PyPI’s security stance overall.<br /><br />We fulfill these roles and operate PyPI as a free resource for Python developers to find, install, and publish their open source projects in pursuit of our mission. This will not change, but we do believe that there are concrete ways that our community can help to support us. We also believe that there are changes that we can make to help guide PyPI and the PSF to long-term sustainability, commensurate with the value and usage of for-profit companies.<br /><br />While we echo the statement from the open letter, “<i>This is not (yet) a crisis.</i>”, we also believe that “<i>it is a critical inflection point</i>” as we look to the future of the sustainability of PyPI and the PSF.<br /></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">What Needs to Change</h2><p>We are aligned with the OpenSSF letter on their three key points, but would like to say more about how they relate to PyPI:<br /></p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Commercial and institutional partnerships</h3><p>In 2024, the PSF and <a href="https://www.fastly.com/fast-forward" target="_blank">Fastly</a> signed and <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@ThePSF/112456715341751673" target="_blank">announced</a> a five-year agreement under Fastly’s <a href="https://www.fastly.com/fast-forward" target="_blank">Fast Forward program</a>. This is a fundamentally different kind of commitment from others that we rely on to operate PyPI (and the rest of the Python Software Foundation infrastructure).<br /><br />We feel very fortunate to have long-term recurring partnerships with other providers, but the annual renewal cycles do come with overhead and risk. While we work incredibly hard to use donated credits and services as efficiently as possible<sup>1</sup>, a critical in-kind sponsor choosing not to renew would require precious engineering resources to prepare for and complete a migration to another provider or cost the PSF tens of thousands of dollars a month during an interim period to pay outright.<br /><br />As an organization, we will seek to establish similar long-term agreements with our infrastructure partners.<br /></p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Value-added capabilities &amp; tiered access models</h3><p>Having users pay for PyPI usage is something we cannot, and will not do. As we stated when we originally <a href="https://blog.pypi.org/posts/2023-04-23-introducing-pypi-organizations/" target="_blank">announced PyPI Organizations</a>, paid features must remain opt-in, and core features for publishing and installing projects will remain free.<br /><br />However, we do recognize that corporate publishers have been a large driver of the growth in the resources needed to serve PyPI. As we continue to develop PyPI Organizations features, providing these publishers with higher quotas will allow for the usage they drive by publishing large files to PyPI to be paid for.<br /><br />In general, our roadmap for PyPI Organizations will focus on value-added features that benefit Companies as well as Community projects alike, while continuing to provide those features to Community organizations at no cost.<br /></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">How You Can Help</h2><p>If you or your team install from PyPI for development, continuous integration testing, or deployment, please take time to review the ways in which your tooling utilizes caching, and implement as much of it as possible when installing from free package repositories. PyPI itself heavily utilizes caching when installing our own dependencies, leveraging <a href="https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/blob/691680fa603cce2375505b3b265fe72c0e5ca451/Dockerfile#L93-L101" target="_blank">Docker cache mounts and pip’s internal caching</a> to reduce usage and increase speed of builds, not only for our Python dependencies but <a href="https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/blob/691680fa603cce2375505b3b265fe72c0e5ca451/Dockerfile#L18-L19" target="_blank">npm</a> and <a href="https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/blob/691680fa603cce2375505b3b265fe72c0e5ca451/Dockerfile#L46-L68" target="_blank">apt</a> as well. This shared responsibility for usage is one that we all should bear, rather than treating package repositories as a limitless resource.<br /><br />Just as we intend to seek longer-term agreements with the providers we rely on to operate PyPI, we ask members of the community in organizations that provide such support to champion for similar long-term agreements with open source foundations and projects that rely on them for operations.<br /><br />If your company publishes projects to PyPI, consider signing up for <a href="https://pypi.org/manage/organizations/" target="_blank">PyPI Organizations</a>. The recurring revenue generated by Organizations is a key way that we hope to build a reliable and sustainable base for PyPI moving forward.<br /><br />Even if any of those do not apply to you or your company, but you rely on PyPI, you can always:</p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li><b><a href="https://psfmember.org/civicrm/contribute/transact/?reset=1&amp;id=1" target="_blank">Become a Member</a>:</b> When you sign up as a Supporting Member of the PSF, you become a part of the PSF.

        <p>Each of these class instances has their own separate data (a <code>name</code> attribute, and a <code>price</code> attribute):</p>

  <strong>Introduction</strong>
</h1>

<p>Every developer has that one project that started as a personal solution and unexpectedly found a life of its own. For me, that was <a href="https://github.com/cleder/fastkml" rel="noopener noreferrer">FastKML</a>, a library I built in 2012 to “scratch my own itch.” I needed to embed maps into a website, and at the time, <a href="https://developers.google.com/kml" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>KML</strong></a> was the de facto standard for visualizing geospatial data on the web. <a href="https://geojson.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">GeoJSON</a> existed but was still in its infancy and unsupported by <a href="https://openlayers.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenLayers</a>, which was then the best tool for embedding maps.</p>

<p>Other Python libraries for KML existed, but most were either limited in scope, lacked Python 3 support, or didn’t meet my performance needs. Performance was crucial, so I built <strong>FastKML</strong> using <code>lxml</code> instead of the slower XML DOM used by many contemporaries.</p>

<p>As FastKML evolved, it depended on <a href="https://github.com/shapely/shapely" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shapely</a> for geometry handling, an excellent library, but one that required C extensions and added installation complexity. That led to the birth of <a href="https://github.com/cleder/pygeoif" rel="noopener noreferrer">PyGeoIf</a>, a pure Python implementation of basic geospatial objects. PyGeoIf aimed to serve as a lightweight, dependency-free substitute for Shapely when users didn’t need all of its advanced geometry operations. The API mirrored Shapely’s closely, making migration as simple as replacing<br />

<p>Over the years, both projects aged gracefully, but not without technical debt. They bore the marks of an earlier Python era: Python 2/3 compatibility hacks (at the very beginning Python 2.6 was still in use), missing type hints, and occasionally ambiguous function signatures.</p>

<p>Still, they worked. The test coverage exceeded 95%, bugs were rare, and they continued solving real problems for users long after I had moved on to other roles outside GIS. To my surprise, the packages remained popular; downloads were steady, and employers still asked about them. But I knew the code looked dated, and if I had to review it today, it wouldn’t pass.</p>

<p>Fast forward to 2020. The geospatial landscape had changed; <strong>GeoJSON</strong> had overtaken KML, Python’s ecosystem had matured, and I had learned a great deal about clean code and maintainability. It was time to modernize these legacy projects for the new decade.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  The Need for Change
</h2>

<p>Modernization wasn’t just a matter of adding type hints or updating syntax, it was about bringing two long-lived projects in line with modern development practices. The original codebases had served well for years, but they were increasingly difficult to extend. Function signatures were ambiguous, internal logic was tangled, and adding new features often caused <em>shotgun surgery</em>, requiring edits across multiple unrelated files.</p>

<p>The <strong>Shapely</strong> API had evolved too, fully embracing <strong>PEP 8</strong> naming conventions and adopting more expressive methods. To remain compatible, PyGeoIf needed to evolve alongside it. Meanwhile, Python itself had transformed: type hints, static analysis, and property-based testing were now standard practice rather than novelty.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Drivers of Change
</h3>

<p>The single most important motivator was the <strong>introduction of type hints</strong> in Python. Type annotations have revolutionized how Python code is written, reviewed, and maintained, enhancing readability and catching subtle bugs early through tools like <strong>mypy</strong>.<br />
The first step was static analysis with tools like mypy, which immediately flagged legacy Python 2 compatibility hacks, ambiguous function signatures, and missing type hints. Extending the tests in tandem ensured that each refactor preserved correctness.</p>

<p>Beyond that, the desire for clearer APIs, more maintainable structures, and modern testing techniques pushed the modernization effort forward. I wanted code that not only worked but was <strong>readable, testable, and future-proof</strong>.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  A Tale of Two Refactors
</h3>

<p>For <strong>PyGeoIf</strong>, version 0.7 had been released in 2017. Four years later, in September 2021, I published the first beta of the 1.0 series: fully type-annotated, statically checked with <code>mypy</code>, and tested using <strong>property-based testing</strong> with <a href="https://hypothesis.works/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hypothesis</a> and improved tests with <strong>mutation testing</strong> with <a href="https://mutmut.readthedocs.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer">MutMut</a>. By September 2022, version 1.0 was stable, and by October 2025, it had matured to version 1.5.</p>

<p>For <strong>FastKML</strong>, after a long silence since version 0.11 in 2015, I released version 0.12 in September 2021, incorporating long-neglected pull requests and minor improvements. A month later came <strong>FastKML 1.0 alpha 1</strong> on PyPI. What I thought would be a quick release became an 18-iteration journey spanning three years, culminating in <strong>version 1.0</strong> in November 2024; finally the library I had envisioned years earlier.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Reflecting on Contributions and Community Support
</h2>

<p>Over the past few years of developing <strong>PyGeoIf</strong> and <strong>FastKML</strong>, the journey has been shaped not only by personal effort but also by the support and engagement of the open-source community. One striking example of this has been <strong>Hacktoberfest contributions</strong> which consistently provided motivation and tangible progress.</p>

<p>These contributions may seem small individually, but collectively they have <strong>kept the momentum going</strong>. Seeing community members engage with the projects during Hacktoberfest has been a <strong>continuing source of encouragement</strong>, reminding me that every bit of contribution helps make the software more robust, maintainable, and welcoming to others.</p>

<p>The positive impact goes beyond the specific changes. Hacktoberfest contributions have:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Encouraged ongoing improvement</strong> by motivating incremental updates.</li>
<li>
<strong>Highlighted the value of community participation</strong> in maintaining and modernizing open-source projects.</li>
<li>
<strong>Reinforced a sense of shared purpose</strong>, showing that even small efforts can collectively advance a project.</li>
</ul>

<p>This ongoing collaboration has made the development process <strong>more rewarding and sustainable</strong>, reinforcing a simple but powerful lesson: in open-source, community engagement isn’t just about code, it’s about inspiration and momentum.</p>

<p>Hacktoberfest contributions aren’t just code, they’re <strong>encouragement</strong>. They spark incremental improvements, highlight the value of shared effort, and inspire continued development. Seeing others invest their time and ideas in these projects has been a <strong>constant source of motivation</strong> to keep improving, testing, and refining.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Hacktoberfest and the Power of Community
</h2>

<p>Developing <strong>PyGeoIf</strong> and <strong>FastKML</strong> has been a journey of learning, coding, and refining, but it’s the <strong>community contributions</strong>, especially during Hacktoberfest, that have truly kept the momentum alive.</p>

<p>October has consistently brought a wave of engagement: pre-commit hooks, bug fixes, minor enhancements, and automated improvements. Each contribution, no matter how small, <strong>reinforced the sense of progress</strong> and reminded me that open-source thrives on collaboration.</p>

<p>Looking forward, this collaborative energy continues to <strong>fuel future features and refinements</strong>. Hacktoberfest has proven that even small contributions can make a big difference, both in the code and in the spirit of the community.</p>

The newest PSF Board has decided to continue investing in connecting with the global Python community by running the PSF Board Office Hour sessions on the <a href="https://discord.gg/4Hm36PPgpG" target="_blank">PSF Discord</a> into 2026.&nbsp;<br /><br />We began running these sessions in September 2024, and they have proven to be a great method for the community to connect with the board and vice versa. The sessions have provided the PSF Board and Staff the opportunity to hear what our community is up to and what challenges they are facing, as well as receive invaluable feedback about how the PSF can continue to improve our service to the Python community.&nbsp;<br /></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">What are the PSF Board Office Hours?</h2><p>During the PSF Board Office Hours, you can participate in a <b>text-based live chat</b> with PSF Board Directors. This is a chance to connect, share, and collaborate with the PSF Board and Staff to improve our community together. Occasionally, we will have dedicated topics such as PyCon US and the PSF Board Elections for the office hour sessions.&nbsp;<br /><br />Here is some of the work that we collaborate with staff and volunteers on:<br /><br /></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Promotion and outreach for the Python programming language</li><li>Supporting local Python communities</li><li>Organizing PyCon US</li><li>Diversity and Inclusion in our community</li><li>Support handling Code of Conduct issues within our communities</li><li>Furthering <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/mission/" target="_blank">the mission of the PSF</a></li></ul><p style="text-align: left;"><br />Unless we have a dedicated topic for a session, you are not limited to talking with us about the above topics, although the discussions should be focused on Python, the PSF, and our community. If you think there’s something we can help with or we should know, we welcome you to come and talk to us!<br /></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Joining the office hours</h2><p>The office hour sessions will take place on the PSF Discord server in the #psf-board channel. If you are new to Discord, make sure to check out <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360033931551-Getting-Started" target="_blank">a tutorial on how you can download the app and sign up for free</a>– then join us on the <a href="https://discord.gg/4Hm36PPgpG" target="_blank">PSF Discord</a>! To make the office hours more accessible, the office hours will be scheduled at alternating times, so no matter where you are based, you can find a time that is most convenient for you! Here is a list of the dates and times:</p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>November 4th, 2 pm UTC</li><li>December 9th, 9 pm UTC</li><li>January 13th, 2 pm UTC&nbsp;</li><li>February 10th, 9 pm UTC</li><li>March 10th, 1 pm UTC&nbsp;</li><li>April 14th, 9 pm UTC</li><li>May 12th, 1 pm UTC&nbsp;</li><li>June 9th, 9 pm UTC</li><li>July 14th, 1 pm UTC&nbsp;</li><li>August 11th, 9 pm UTC</li><li>September 8th, 1 pm UTC&nbsp;</li><li>October 13th, 9 pm UTC</li></ul><p><br />Each session lasts for an hour. Sessions after October 2026 will be announced in the future.<br /></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Who will be at the office hours?</h2><p>Some board members of the PSF will be attending each office hour, as well as members of the PSF Staff. The <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/board/#id33" target="_blank">list of the current PSF Board Directors</a> can be found on our website. We are passionate Python community members who are excited to listen, help, and provide support to you. We are happy to follow up with you if there are any issues we cannot address immediately during the office hour sessions. As always, you can email us at psf-board@python.org with inquiries, feedback, or comments any time.&nbsp;</p>

involves dropping support for whatever Python version is no longer supported

that, I go through the issue tracker, answer questions, and fix whatever I can
fix. Then I release new versions. Then I think about which projects I should

          <p class="text-base-content">
            <p>In January 2025, the PSF submitted a proposal to the US government National Science Foundation under the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/safe-ose-safety-security-privacy-open-source-ecosystems" target="_blank">Safety, Security, and Privacy of Open Source Ecosystems program</a> to address structural vulnerabilities in Python and PyPI. It was the PSF’s first time applying for government funding, and navigating the intensive process was a steep learning curve for our small team to climb. Seth Larson, PSF Security Developer in Residence, serving as Principal Investigator (PI) with Loren Crary, PSF Deputy Executive Director, as co-PI, led the multi-round proposal writing process as well as the months-long vetting process. We invested our time and effort because we felt the PSF’s work is a strong fit for the program and that the benefit to the community if our proposal were accepted was considerable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div><div>We were honored when, after many months of work, our proposal was recommended for funding, particularly as only <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/overview" target="_blank">36% </a>of new NSF grant applicants are successful on their first attempt. We became concerned, however, when we were presented with the terms and conditions we would be required to agree to if we accepted the grant. These terms included affirming the statement that we “do not, and will not during the term of this financial assistance award, operate any programs that advance or promote DEI, or discriminatory equity ideology in violation of Federal anti-discrimination laws.” This restriction would apply not only to the security work directly funded by the grant, <b>but to any and all activity of the PSF as a whole</b>. Further, violation of this term gave the NSF the right to “claw back” previously approved and transferred funds. This would create a situation where money we’d already spent could be taken back, which would be an enormous, open-ended financial risk.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div></div><div><br /></div><div>Diversity, equity, and inclusion are core to the PSF’s values, as committed to in our <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/mission/" target="_blank">mission statement</a>:&nbsp;</div><div><div></div></div><blockquote><div><div><i>The mission of the Python Software Foundation is to promote, protect, and advance the Python programming language, and to support and facilitate the growth of <b>a diverse and international community</b> of Python programmers.</i></div></div><div></div></blockquote><div><div>Given the value of the grant to the community and the PSF, we did our utmost to get clarity on the terms and to find a way to move forward in concert with our values. We consulted our NSF contacts and reviewed decisions made by other organizations in similar circumstances, particularly <a href="https://carpentries.org/blog/2025/06/announcing-withdrawal-of-nsf-pose-proposal/" target="_blank">The Carpentries</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div></div><div><br /></div><div><div>In the end, however, the PSF simply can’t agree to a statement that we won’t operate any programs that “advance or promote” diversity, equity, and inclusion, as it would be a betrayal of our mission and our community.&nbsp;</div></div><div><br /></div><div><div>We’re disappointed to have been put in the position where we had to make this decision, because we believe our proposed project would offer invaluable advances to the Python and greater open source community, protecting millions of PyPI users from attempted supply-chain attacks. The proposed project would create new tools for automated proactive review of all packages uploaded to PyPI, rather than the current process of reactive-only review. These novel tools would rely on capability analysis, designed based on a dataset of known malware. Beyond just protecting PyPI users, the outputs of this work could be transferable for all open source software package registries, such as NPM and Crates.io, improving security across multiple open source ecosystems.</div></div><div><br /></div><div><div>In addition to the security benefits, the grant funds would have made a big difference to the PSF’s budget. The PSF is a relatively small organization, operating with an annual budget of around $5 million per year, with a staff of just 14. $1.5 million over two years would have been quite a lot of money for us, and easily the largest grant we’d ever received. Ultimately, however, the value of the work and the size of the grant were not more important than practicing our values and retaining the freedom to support every part of our community. The PSF Board voted unanimously to withdraw our application.&nbsp;</div></div><div><br /></div><div><div>Giving up the NSF grant opportunity—along with inflation, lower sponsorship, economic pressure in the tech sector, and global/local uncertainty and conflict—means the PSF needs financial support now more than ever. We are incredibly grateful for any help you can offer. If you're already a PSF member or regular donor, you have our deep appreciation, and we urge you to share your story about why you support the PSF. Your stories make all the difference in spreading awareness about the mission and work of the PSF.&nbsp;</div></div><div><br /></div><div><div>How to support the PSF:</div></div><div><ul style="text-align: left;"><li><a href="https://psfmember.org/civicrm/contribute/transact/?reset=1&amp;id=1">Become a Member</a>: When you sign up as a Supporting Member of the PSF, you become a part of the PSF.

            Building a UI in Python usually means choosing between "quick and limited" or "powerful and painful." What if you could write modern, component-based web apps in pure Python and still keep full control? NiceGUI, pronounced "Nice Guy" sits on FastAPI with a Vue/Quasar front end, gives you real components, live updates over websockets, and it’s running in production at Zauberzeug, a German robotic company. On this episode, I’m talking with NiceGUI’s creators, Rodja Trappe and Falko Schindler, about how it works, where it shines, and what’s coming next. With version 3.0 releasing around the same time this episode comes out, we spend the end of the episode celebrating the 3.0 release.

            <p>With the release of <strong>psutil 7.1.2</strong>, wheels for free-threaded Python are now
available. This milestone was achieved largely through a <strong>community effort</strong>,
as several internal refactorings to the C code were required to make it
possible (see <a href="https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil/issues/2565#issuecomment-2910225647">issue #2565</a>).
Many of these changes were contributed by <a href="https://github.com/lysnikolaou">Lysandros

            This is a guest post from Dido Grigorov, a deep learning engineer and Python programmer with 17 years of experience in the field. Python’s flexibility and ease of use make it a go-to language for developers, but its interpreted nature and global interpreter lock (GIL) can lead to performance bottlenecks, especially in large-scale or resource-intensive [&#8230;]

        <div class="p-4 flex-grow overflow-hidden">
          <p class="text-base-content">
            <p>Plenty has been written about how hard it is to build in Europe versus the US.
The list is always the same with little process: brittle politics, dense
bureaucracy, mandatory notaries, endless and rigid
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_your_customer">KYC</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti%E2%80%93money_laundering">AML</a> processes.
Fine.  I know, you know.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not here to add another complaint to the pile (but if we meet over a beer
or coffee, I&#8217;m happy to unload a lot of hilarious anecdotes on you).  The
unfortunate reality is that most of these constraints won&#8217;t change in my
lifetime and maybe ever.  Europe is not culturally aligned with
entrepreneurship, it&#8217;s opposed to the idea of employee equity, and our laws
reflect that.</p>
<p>What bothers me isn&#8217;t the rules — it&#8217;s the posture that develops from it within
people that should know better.  Across the system, everyone points at someone
else.  If a process takes 10 steps, you&#8217;ll find 10 people who feel absolved of
responsibility because they can cite 9 other blockers.  Friction becomes a
moral license to do a mediocre job (while lamenting about it).</p>
<p>The vibe is: &#8220;Because the system is slow, I can be slow.  Because there are
rules, I don&#8217;t need judgment. Because there&#8217;s risk, I don&#8217;t need initiative.&#8221;
And then we all nod along and nothing moves.</p>
<p>There are excellent people here; I&#8217;ve worked with them.  But they are fighting
upstream against a default of low agency.  When the process is bad, too many
people collapse into it.  Communication narrows to the shortest possible
message.  Friday after 2pm, the notary won&#8217;t reply — and the notary surely will blame
labor costs or regulation for why service ends there.  The bank will cite
compliance for why they don&#8217;t need to do anything.  The registrar will point at
some law that allows them to demand a translation of a document by a court
appointed translator.  Everyone has a reason.  No one owns the outcome.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the US, our counsel replies when it matters, even after hours.
Bankers answer the same day.  The instinct is to enable progress, not enumerate
reasons you can’t have it.  The goal is the outcome and the rules are
constraints to navigate, not a shield to hide behind.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s the point?  I can&#8217;t fix politics.  What I can do: act with agency,
and surround myself with people who do the same and speak in support of it.
Work with those who start from &#8220;how do we make this work?&#8221; not &#8220;why this can&#8217;t
work.&#8221;  Name the absurdities without using them as cover.  Be transparent, move
anyway and tell people.</p>
<p>Nothing stops a notary from designing an onboarding flow that gets an Austrian
company set up in five days — standardized KYC packets, templated resolutions,
scheduled signing slots, clear checklists, async updates, a bias for same-day
feedback.  That could exist right now.  It rarely does or falls short.</p>
<p>Yes, much in Europe is objectively worse for builders.  We have to accept it.
Then squeeze everything you can from what is in your control:</p>
<ul>
<li>Own the handoff. When you&#8217;re step 3 of 10, behave like step 10 depends on you
and behave like you control all 10 steps.  Anticipate blockers further down
the line.  Move same day.  Eliminate ambiguity.  Close loops.</li>
<li>Default to clarity.  Send checklists.  Preempt the next two questions.
Reduce the number of touches.</li>
<li>Model urgency without theatrics.  Be calm, fast, and precise.  Don&#8217;t
make your customer chase you.</li>
<li>Use judgment.  Rules exist and we can&#8217;t break them all.  But we can work with
them and be guided by them.</li>

<p>Select for agency.  Choose partners who answer promptly when it&#8217;s material and
who don&#8217;t confuse process with progress.</p>
<p>The trap is not only regulation.  It&#8217;s the learned helplessness it breeds.  If
we let friction set our standards, we become the friction.  We won&#8217;t legislate
our way to a US-style environment anytime soon.  But we don&#8217;t need permission
to be better operators inside a bad one.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the contrast and it&#8217;s the part we control.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Postscript:</strong> Comparing Europe to the US triggers people and I&#8217;m concious of
that.  Maturity is holding two truths at once: they do some things right and
some things wrong and so do we.  You don&#8217;t win by talking others down or
praying for their failure.  I&#8217;d rather see both Europe and the US succeed than
celebrate Europe failing slightly less.</p>
<p>And no, saying I feel gratitude and happiness when I get a midnight reply
doesn&#8217;t make me anti-work-life balance (<a href="/2025/9/4/996/">I am not</a>).  It means
when something is truly time-critical, fast, clear action lifts everyone.  The
times someone sent a document in minutes, late at night, both sides felt good
about it when it mattered.  Responsiveness, used with judgment, is not
exploitation; it&#8217;s respect for outcomes and the relationships we form.</p>
