Lawrence Convention Center in beautiful downtown Pittsburgh. PyCon US 2025 was packed with 9 days of content, education, and networking for the Python community, including 6 Keynote Sessions, 91 Talks, including the Charlas Spanish track, 24 Tutorials, 20 Posters, 30+ Sprint Projects, 146 Open Spaces, and 60 Booths!&nbsp;</li><li><b>Continuing to enhance Python and PyPI’s security through Developers-in-Residence:</b> The PSF’s PyPI Safety and Security Engineer, Mike Fiedler, has implemented new safeguards, including automation to detect expiring email domains and prevent impersonation attacks, as well as guidance for maintainers to use more secure authentication methods like WebAuthn and Trusted Publishers. The PSF’s Security Developer-in-Residence, Seth Larson, continues to lead efforts to strengthen Python’s security and transparency. His work on PEP 770 introduces standardized Software Bill-of-Materials (SBOMs) within Python packages, improving visibility into dependencies for stronger supply chain security. A <a href="https://alpha-omega.dev/blog/slippery-zips-and-sticky-tar-pits-security-and-archives-white-paper-by-seth-larson-python-software-foundation/" target="_blank">new white paper co-authored with Alpha-Omega</a> outlines how these improvements enhance trust and measurability across the ecosystem.&nbsp;</li><li><b>Adoption of <a href="http://pypistats.org">pypistats.org</a>:</b> The <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2025/08/pypistats-org-is-now-operated-by-the-psf.html" target="_blank">PSF infrastructure team has officially adopted the operation of pypistats.org</a>, which had been run by volunteer Christopher Flynn for over six years (thank you, Christopher!). The PSF’s Infrastructure Team now handles the service’s infrastructure, costs, and domain registration– and the service itself remains open source and community-maintained.&nbsp;</li><li><b>Advancing PyPI Organizations:</b> The rollout of <a href="https://docs.pypi.org/organization-accounts/" target="_blank">PyPI Organizations</a> is now well underway, marking a major milestone in improving project management and collaboration across the Python ecosystem. With new Terms of Service finalized and supporting tools in place, the PSF has cleared its backlog of requests and approved thousands of organizations—including 2,409 Community and 4979 Company organizations as of today. Hundreds of these organizations have already begun adding members, transferring projects, and subscribing to the new Company tier, generating sustainable support for the PSF. We’re excited to see how teams are using these new features to better organize and maintain their projects on PyPI.</li><li><b>Empowering the Python community through Fiscal Sponsorship:</b> We are proud to continue supporting our 20 fiscal sponsoree organizations with their initiatives and events all year round. The PSF provides 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status to fiscal sponsorees such as PyLadies and Pallets, and provides back office support so they can focus on their missions. Consider <a href="https://linktr.ee/thepsf" target="_blank">donating to your favorite PSF Fiscal Sponsoree</a> and check out our <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/fiscal-sponsorees/" target="_blank">Fiscal Sponsorees page</a> to learn more about what each of these awesome organizations is all about!</li><li><b>Serving our community with grants:</b> The PSF Grants Program awarded approximately $340K to 86 grantees around the world; supporting local conferences, workshops, and community initiatives that keep Python growing and accessible to all. While we had to make <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2025/08/the-psf-has-paused-our-grants-program.html" target="_blank">the difficult decision to pause the program early</a> to ensure financial sustainability, we would love to reopen it as soon as possible. Your participation in this year’s fundraiser fuels that effort!</li><li><b>Honoring community leaders:</b> The PSF honored three leaders with Distinguished Service Awards this year. <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2025/03/psf-dsa-ewa-jodlowska.html" target="_blank">Ewa Jodlowska</a> helped transform the PSF into a professional, globally supportive organization. <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2025/03/dsa-thomas-wouters.html" target="_blank">Thomas Wouters</a> has contributed decades of leadership, guidance, and institutional knowledge. <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2025/03/dsa-van-lindberg.html" target="_blank">Van Lindberg</a> provided essential legal expertise that guided the PSF through growth and governance. Their dedication has left a lasting impact on the PSF, Python, and its community.&nbsp;The PSF was also thrilled to recognize <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2025/10/announcing-psf-community-service-award.html" target="_blank">Katie McLaughlin, Sarah Kuchinsky, and Rodrigo Girão Serrão with Community Service Awards</a>&nbsp;(CSA) for their outstanding contributions to the Python community. Their dedication, creativity, and generosity embody the spirit of Python and strengthen our global community.&nbsp;We recognized Jay Miller with a CSA for his work to improve diversity, inclusion, and equity in the global Python community through founding and sustaining Black Python Devs. We also honored Matt Lebrun and Micaela Reyes with CSA's for their efforts to grow and support the Python community in the Philippines through conferences, meetups, and volunteer programs.</li><li><b>Finding strength in the Python community:</b> When the PSF shared <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2025/10/NSF-funding-statement.html" target="_blank">the news about turning down a NSF grant</a>, the outpouring of support from the Python community was nothing short of incredible. In just one day, you helped raise over $60K and welcomed 125 new Supporting Members- in the week after, that number jumped to $150K+ and 270+ new Supporting Members! A community-led matching campaign and countless messages of support, solidarity, and encouragement reminded us that while some choices are tough, we never face them alone. The PSF Board &amp; Staff are deeply moved and energized by your words, actions, and continued belief in our shared mission. This moment has set the stage for a record-breaking end-of-year fundraiser, and we are so incredibly grateful to be in community with each of you.&nbsp;</li></ul>

    <h2>Parentheses can be used for grouping</h2>
    
      
        <p>Parentheses are used for 3 things in Python: <strong>calling callables</strong>, <strong>creating empty tuples</strong>, and <strong>grouping</strong>.</p>

      
        <p>Functions, classes, and other [callable][] objects can be called with parentheses:</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"I'm calling a function"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">I'm calling a function</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>Empty tuples can be created with parentheses:</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">empty</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">()</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>Lastly, parentheses can be used for <strong>grouping</strong>:</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="mi">3</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">4</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">7</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">33</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>Sometimes parentheses are <em>necessary</em> to convey the order of execution for an expression.
For example, <code>3 * (4 + 7)</code> is different than <code>3 * 4 + 7</code>:</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="mi">3</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">4</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">7</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">33</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="mi">3</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">4</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">7</span>
<span class="go">19</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>Those parentheses around <code>4 + 7</code> are for grouping that sub-expression, which changes the meaning of the larger expression.</p>

      
        <p>All confusing and unnecessary uses of parentheses are caused by this third use: <strong>grouping parentheses</strong>.</p>

      
    
  
    <h2>Python's <code>if</code> statements don't use parentheses</h2>
    
      <p>In JavaScript <code>if</code> statements look …</p>

<h2 id="pipdeptree">pipdeptree</h2>
<p><code>pipdeptree</code> is pip installable, but I don&rsquo;t want <code>pipdeptree</code> itself to be reported alongside everything else installed, so I usually install it outside of a project. We can use it system wide by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Installing with <code>uv tool install pipdeptree</code>.
<ul>
<li>Then running with <code>pipdeptree --python auto</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Running without installing with <code>uvx pipdeptree --python auto</code></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="usage">usage</h3>
<p>The <code>--python auto</code> tells <code>pipdeptree</code> to look at the current environment.</p>

            Today we’re digging into the Model Context Protocol, or MCP. Think LSP for AI: build a small Python service once and your tools and data show up across editors and agents like VS Code, Claude Code, and more. My guest, Den Delimarsky from Microsoft, helps build this space and will keep us honest about what’s solid versus what's just shiny. We’ll keep it practical: transports that actually work, guardrails you can trust, and a tiny server you could ship this week. By the end, you’ll have a clear mental model and a path to plug Python into the internet of agents.

            <p>It&#8217;s been a busy, bumpy week with coverage.py. Some things did not go
smoothly, and I didn&#8217;t handle everything as well as I could have.</p><p>It started with trying to fix <a href="https://github.com/coveragepy/coveragepy/issues/2064" rel="external noopener">issue 2064</a> about
conflicts between the &#8220;sysmon&#8221; measurement core and a concurrency setting.</p><p>To measure your code, coverage.py needs to know what code got executed. To
know that, it collects execution events from the Python interpreter. CPython now
has two mechanisms for this: trace functions and sys.monitoring.  Coverage.py
has two implementations of a trace function (in C and in Python), and an
implementation of a sys.monitoring listener.  These three components are the
measurement cores, known as &#8220;ctrace&#8221;, &#8220;pytrace&#8221;, and &#8220;sysmon&#8221;.</p><p>The fastest is sysmon, but there are coverage.py features it doesn&#8217;t yet
support.  With Python 3.14, sysmon is the default core.  Issue 2064 complained
that when the defaulted core conflicted with an explicit concurrency choice, the
conflict resulted in an error.  I agreed with the issue: since the core was
defaulted, it shouldn&#8217;t be an error, we should choose a different core.</p><p>But I figured if you explicitly asked for the sysmon core and also a
conflicting setting, that should be an error because you&#8217;ve got two settings
that can&#8217;t be used together.</p><p>Implementing all that got a little involved because of &#8220;metacov&#8221;: coverage.py
coverage-measuring itself.  The sys.monitoring facility in Python was added in
3.12, but wasn&#8217;t fully fleshed out enough to do branch coverage until 3.14. When
we measure ourselves, we use branch coverage, so 3.12 and 3.13 needed some
special handling to avoid causing the error that sysmon plus branch coverage
would cause.</p><p>I got it all done, and <a href="https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/7.11.3/changes.html#version-7-11-1-2025-11-07" rel="external noopener">released 7.11.1</a> on Friday.</p><p>Soon, <a href="https://github.com/coveragepy/coveragepy/issues/2077" rel="external noopener">issue 2077</a> arrived. Another fix in 7.11.1
involved some missing branches when using the sysmon core.  That fix required
parsing the source code during execution.  But sometimes the &#8220;code&#8221; can&#8217;t be
parsed: Jinja templates compile html files to Python and use the html file as
the file name for the code. When coverage.py tries to parse the html file as
Python, of course it fails. My fix didn&#8217;t account for this.  I fixed that on
Saturday and <a href="https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/7.11.3/changes.html#version-7-11-2-2025-11-08" rel="external noopener">released 7.11.2</a>.</p><p>In the meantime, <a href="https://github.com/coveragepy/coveragepy/issues/2076" rel="external noopener">issue 2076</a> and <a href="https://github.com/coveragepy/coveragepy/issues/2078" rel="external noopener">issue
2078</a> both pointed out that now some settings combinations that used to
produce warnings now produced errors. This is a breaking change, they said, and
should not have been released as a patch version.</p><p>To be honest, my first reaction was that it wasn&#8217;t that big a deal, the
settings were in conflict. Fix the settings and all will be well.  It&#8217;s hard to
remember all of the possibilities when making changes like this, it&#8217;s easy to
make mistakes, and semantic versioning is bound to have judgement calls anyway.
I had already spent a while getting 7.11.1 done, and .2 followed just a day
later. I was annoyed and didn&#8217;t want to have to re-think everything.</p><p>But the more I thought about it, I decided they were right: it does break
pipelines that used to work.  And falling back to a different core is fine: the
cores differ in speed and compatibility but (for the most part) produce the same
results. Changing the requested core with a warning is a fine way to deal with
the settings conflict without stopping test suites from running.</p><p>So I just <a href="https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/7.11.3/changes.html#version-7-11-3-2025-11-09" rel="external noopener">released 7.11.3</a> to go back to the older
behavior. Maybe I won&#8217;t have to do another release tomorrow!</p><p>While all this was going on, I also moved the code from my personal GitHub
account to a new <a href="https://github.com/coveragepy" rel="external noopener">coveragepy GitHub
organization</a>!</p><p>Coverage.py is basically a one-man show. Maybe the GitHub organization will
make others feel more comfortable chiming in, but I doubt it. I&#8217;d like to have
more people to talk through changes with.  Maybe I wouldn&#8217;t have had to make
three releases in three days if someone else had been around as a sounding
board.</p><p>I&#8217;m in the <a href="https://discord.gg/RBw567RyWc" rel="external noopener">#coverage-py</a> channel if you want to talk
about any aspect of coverage.py, or I can be reached in
<a href="https://nedbatchelder.com/site/aboutned">lots of other ways</a>. I&#8217;d love to talk to
you.</p>

            <p>I’ve recently migrated my VPS from Fedora to Ubuntu. Here’s a list of things that might be useful to keep in mind before, during, and after a migration of a server that hosts publicly accessible Web sites and applications, as well as other personal services, and how to get rid of the most annoying parts of Ubuntu.</p>
<!-- TEASER_END -->

<h2>Why switch?</h2>
<p>Fedora is a relatively popular distro, so it’s well supported by software vendors. Its packagers adopt a no-nonsense approach, making very little changes that deviate from the upstream.</p>
<p>Ubuntu is not my favorite distro, far from it. While it is perhaps the most popular distro out there, its packages contain many more patches compared to Fedora, and Canonical (the company behind Ubuntu) are famous for betting on the wrong horse (Unity, upstart, Mir…). But one thing Ubuntu does well is stability. Fedora makes releases every 6 months, and those releases are supported for just 13 months, which means upgrading at least every year. Every upgrade may introduce incompatibilities, almost every upgrade requires recreating Python venvs. That gets boring fast, and it does not necessarily bring benefits. Granted, the Fedora system upgrade works quite well, and I upgraded through at least eight releases without a re-install, but I would still prefer to avoid it. That’s why I went with Ubuntu LTS, which is supported for five years, with a new release every two years, but which still comes with reasonably new software (and with many third-party repositories if something is missing or outdated).</p>
<h2>Test your backups</h2>
<p>I have a backup “system” that’s a bunch of Bash scripts. After upgrading one of the services that is being backed up, the responsible script started crashing, and thus backups stopped working. Another thing that broke was e-mails from cron, so I didn’t know anything was wrong.</p>
<p>While I do have full disk backups enabled at <a href="https://hetzner.cloud/?ref=Qy1lehF8PwzP">Hetzner</a> <em>(disclaimer: referral link)</em>, my custom backups are more fine-grained (e.g. important configuration files, database dumps, package lists), so they are quite useful in migrating between OSes.</p>
<p>So, here’s a reminder not only to test your backups regularly, but also to make sure they are being created at all, and to make sure cron can send you logs somewhere you can see them.</p>
<p>Bonus cron tip: set <code>MAILFROM=</code> and <code>MAILTO=</code> in your crontab if your SMTP server does not like the values cron uses by default.</p>
<h2>Think about IP address reassignment (or pray to the DNS gods)</h2>
<p>A new VPS or cloud server probably means a new IP address. But if you get a new IP address, that might complicate the migration of your publicly accessible applications. If you’re proxying all your Web properties through Cloudflare or something similar, that’s probably not an issue. But if you have a raw A record somewhere, things can get complicated. DNS servers and operating systems do a lot of caching. The conventional wisdom is to wait 24 or even 48 hours after changing DNS values. This might be true if your TTL is set to a long value, but if your TTL is short, the only worry are DNS servers that ignore TTL values and cache records for longer. If you plan a migration, it’s good to check your TTL well in advance, and not worry too much about broken DNS servers.</p>
<p>But you might not need a new IP. Carefully review your cloud provider’s IP management options before making any changes. Hetzner is more flexible than other hosts in this regard, as it is possible to <a href="https://docs.hetzner.com/cloud/servers/primary-ips/faq">move primary public IP addresses (not “floating” or “elastic” IPs) between servers</a>, as long as you’re okay with a few minutes’ downtime (you will need to shut down the source and destination servers).</p>
<p>If you’re not okay with any downtime, you would probably want to leverage the floating/elastic IP feature, or hope DNS propagates quickly enough.</p>
<h2>Trim the fat</h2>
<p>My VPS ran a lot of services I don’t need anymore, but never really got around to decommissioning. For example, I had a full Xfce install with VNC access (the VNC server was only running when needed). I haven’t actually used the desktop for ages, so I just dropped it.</p>
<p>I also had an OpenVPN setup. It was useful years ago, when mobile data allowances were much smaller and speeds much worse. These days, I don’t use public WiFi networks at all, unless I’m going abroad, and I just buy one month of <a href="https://mullvad.net/">Mullvad VPN</a> for €5 whenever that happens. So, add another service to the “do not migrate” list.</p>
<p>One thing that I could not just remove was the e-mail server. Many years ago, I ran a reasonably functional e-mail server on my VPS. I’ve since then migrated to <a href="https://www.zoho.com/mail/">Zoho Mail</a> (which costs €10.80/year), in part due to IP reputation issues after changing hosting providers, and also to avoid having to fight spam. When I did that, I kept Postfix around, but as a local server for things like cron or Django to send e-mail with, and I configured it to send all e-mails via Zoho. But I did not really want to move over all the configuration, hoping that Ubuntu’s Postfix packages can work with my hacked together config from Fedora. So I replaced the server with <a href="https://www.opensmtpd.org/">OpenSMTPD</a> (from the OpenBSD project), and all the Postfix configuration files with just one short configuration file:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">table aliases file:/etc/aliases
table secrets file:/etc/mail-secrets

listen on localhost
listen on 172.17.0.1 # Docker

action "relay" relay host smtp+tls://smtp@smtp.example.net:587 auth &lt;secrets&gt; mail-from "@example.com"

match from any for any action "relay"
</pre></div>

<h2>Dockerize everything…</h2>
<p>My server runs a few different apps, some of which are exposed on the public Internet, while some do useful work in the background. The services I have set up most recently are containerized with the help of Docker. The only Docker-based service that was stateful (and did not just use folders mounted as volumes) was a MariaDB database. Migrating that is straightforward with a simple dump-and-restore.</p>
<p>Of course, not everything on my server is in Docker. The public-facing nginx install isn’t, and neither is PostgreSQL (but that was also a quick dump-and-restore migration with some extra steps).</p>
<h2>…especially Python</h2>
<p>But then, there are the Python apps. Python the language is cool (if a little slow), but the packaging story is a <a href="https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2023/01/15/how-to-improve-python-packaging/">total</a> dumpster <a href="https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2024/01/15/python-packaging-one-year-later/">fire</a>.</p>
<p>By the way, here’s a quick recap of 2024/2025 in Python packaging: the most hyped Python package manager (<code>uv</code>) is written in Rust, which screams “Python is a toy language in which you can’t even write a tool as simple as a package manager”. (I know, dependency resolution is computationally expensive, so doing <em>that</em> in Rust makes sense, but everything else could easily be done in pure Python. And no, the package manager should not manage Python installs.) Of course, almost all the other contenders listed in my 2023 post are still being developed. On the standards front, the community finally produced a lockfile standard after years of discussions.</p>
<p>Anyway, I have three Python apps. One of them is <a href="https://isso-comments.de/">Isso</a>, which is providing the comments box below this post. I used to run a modified version of Isso a long time ago, but I don’t need to anymore. I looked at the docs, and they offer <a href="https://isso-comments.de/docs/reference/installation/#using-docker">a pre-built Docker image</a>, which means I could just quickly deploy it on my server with Docker and skip the pain of managing Python environments.</p>
<p>The other two apps are Django projects built by yours truly. They are not containerized, they exist in venvs created using the system Python. Moving venvs between machines is generally impossible, so I had to re-create them. Of course, I hit a deprecation, because the Python maintainers (especially in the packaging world) does not understand their responsibility as maintainers of the most popular programming language. This time, it was caused by <a href="https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11457">an old editable install with setuptools (using setup.py develop, not PEP 660)</a>, and installs with more recent pip/setuptools versions would not have this error… although <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/do-we-want-to-keep-the-build-system-default-for-pyproject-toml/104759">some people want to remove the fallback to setuptools if there is no pyproject.toml</a>, so you need to stay up to date with the whims of the Python packaging industry if you want to use Python software.</p>
<h2>Don’t bother with ufw</h2>
<p>Ubuntu ships with <code>ufw</code>, the “uncomplicated firewall”, in the default install. I was previously using <code>firewalld</code>, a Red Hat-adjacent project, but I decided to give ufw a try. Since if it’s part of the default install, it might be supported better by the system.</p>
<p>It turns out that Docker and ufw <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/network/packet-filtering-firewalls/#docker-and-ufw">don’t play together</a>. <a href="https://github.com/chaifeng/ufw-docker?tab=readme-ov-file#solving-ufw-and-docker-issues">Someone has built a set of rules that are supposed to fix it</a>, but that did not work for me.</p>
<p>Docker <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/network/packet-filtering-firewalls/#integration-with-firewalld">does integrate with firewalld</a>, and Ubuntu has packages for it, so I just installed it, enabled the services that need to be publicly available and things were working again.</p>
<p><em>Update (2025-11-23):</em> The iptables integration was not very stable on my Ubuntu system, so I disabled the iptables integration and switched to <a href="https://dev.to/soerenmetje/how-to-secure-a-docker-host-using-firewalld-2joo">a simpler config in firewalld only</a>.</p>
<h2>Kill the ads (and other nonsense too)</h2>
<p>Red Hat makes money by selling a stable OS with at least 10 years of support to enterprises, and their free offering is Fedora, with just 13 months of support; RHEL releases are branched off from Fedora. SUSE also sells SUSE Linux Enterprise and has openSUSE as the free offering (but the relationship between the paid and free version is more complicated).</p>
<p>Ubuntu chose a different monetization strategy: the enterprise offering is the same OS as the free offering, but it gets extra packages and extra updates. The free OS advertises the paid services. It is fairly simple to get rid of them all:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">sudo apt autoremove ubuntu-pro-client
sudo chmod -x /etc/update-motd.d/*
</pre></div>

<p>Also, Ubuntu installs snap by default. Snap is a terrible idea. Luckily, there are no snaps installed by default on a Server install, so we can just remove <code>snapd</code>. We’ll also remove <code>lxd-installer</code> to save ~25 kB of disk space, since the installer requires snap, and lxd is another unsuccessful Canonical project.</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">sudo apt autoremove snapd lxd-installer
</pre></div>

<h2>The cost of downgrading</h2>
<p>Going from Fedora 42 (April 2025) to Ubuntu 24.04 (April 2024) means some software will be downgraded in the process. In general, this does not matter, as most software does not mind downgrades as much. One notable exception is WeeChat, the IRC client, whose config files are versioned, and Ubuntu’s version is not compatible with the one in Fedora. But here’s where Ubuntu’s popularity shines: <a href="https://weechat.org/download/debian/">WeeChat has its own repositories for Debian and Ubuntu</a>, so I could just get the latest version without building it myself or trying to steal packages from a newer version.</p>
<p>Other than WeeChat, I haven’t experienced any other issues with software due to a downgrade. Some of it is luck (or not using new/advanced features), some of it is software caring about backwards compatibility.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Was it worth it? Time will tell. Upgrading Fedora itself was not that hard, and I expect Ubuntu upgrades to be OK too — the annoying part was cleaning up and getting things to work after the upgrade, and the switch means I will have to do it only every 2-4 years instead of every 6-12 months.</p>
<p>The switchover took a few hours, especially since I didn’t have much up-to-date documentation of what is actually installed and running, and there are always the minor details where distros differ that may require adjusting to. I think a migration like this is worth trying if rolling-release or frequently-released distros are too unstable for your needs.</p>

        <p>Here we have a class called <code>Point</code> in a <code>points.py</code> file:</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Point</span><span class="p">:</span>

        <span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>And here's an instance of this <code>Point</code> class:</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">p</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Point</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>Normally, classes store their attributes in a <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/using-dictionaries-in-python/" target="_blank">dictionary</a> called <code>__dict__</code>.</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">p</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="vm">__dict__</span>
<span class="go">{'x': 1, 'y': 2, 'z': 3}</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>We have a class here where every instance has <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>z</code> attributes.
But we could add other attributes to any instance of this <code>Point</code> class, and another key-value pair will appear in this <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/where-are-attributes-stored/" target="_blank"><code>__dict__</code></a> dictionary.</p>

      
        <p>For example if we add a <code>w</code> attribute:</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">p</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">w</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">4</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>Our <code>__dict__</code> dictionary will now have a <code>w</code> attribute:</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">p</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="vm">__dict__</span>
<span class="go">{'x': 1, 'y': 2, 'z': 3, 'w': 4}</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>This is how classes work <em>by default</em>; classes work this way <strong>unless you use <code>__slots__</code></strong>.</p>

          <p class="text-base-content">
            <p>As the PSF heads into our end-of-year fundraiser, we want to share information to help “connect the dots” and show a more complete picture of the PSF’s current financial outlook. You’ve heard from us on subjects related to our financial position from several different angles recently (a list of those posts is below). We’ve prioritized proactive communications, because we believe in transparency, we have trust in our community, and we value keeping you informed— we know how invested in and impacted by our work you are. We now want to pull those threads together in order to create some shared clarity on the big picture, and, hopefully, inspire you to action to support our fundraising efforts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">The dots</h2><p>Many groups, organizers, and individuals in the Python community and beyond are experiencing the impacts of the current financial environment, including inflation, reduced sponsorship, economic pressure in the tech sector, and global/local uncertainty and conflict. Unfortunately, the PSF has felt these effects as well, in a number of ways. We’ve been doing our best to share how the current environment impacts our areas of service to the community as the PSF navigates these challenges over the past couple of years:<br /></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li><a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/12/psf-grants-program-charter-updates-tldr.html" target="_blank">PSF Grants Program Changes</a></li><li><a href="https://pycon.blogspot.com/2024/11/important-changes-ahead-commitment-to.html" target="_blank">PyCon US 2025 Financial Transparency</a></li><li><a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2025/08/the-psf-has-paused-our-grants-program.html" target="_blank">PSF Grants Program Pause</a></li><li><a href="https://openssf.org/blog/2025/09/23/open-infrastructure-is-not-free-a-joint-statement-on-sustainable-stewardship/" target="_blank">Open Infrastructure is not Free Joint Statement&nbsp;</a></li><li><a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2025/10/open-infrastructure-is-not-free-pypi.html" target="_blank">Our post on the Open Infrastructure is Not Free</a></li><li><a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2025/10/NSF-funding-statement.html" target="_blank">NSF Grant Application Withdrawal</a></li></ul><p>To briefly summarize, the PSF’s assets and yearly revenue have declined, and costs have increased, while the demand and need for our work has continued to multiply.&nbsp;<br /><br />Historically, PyCon US has been a source of revenue for the PSF, enabling us to fund programs like our currently paused <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/grants/" target="_blank">Grants Program</a>. A PSF-run PyCon US is also an essential program for the PSF to deliver value to our sponsors. Unfortunately, PyCon US has run at a loss for three years—and not from a lack of effort from our staff and volunteers! Everyone has been working very hard to find areas where we can trim costs, but even with those efforts, inflation continues to surge, and changing US and economic conditions have reduced our attendance. Because PyCon US is still a 2000+ person event, we must secure venue contracts for event spaces that can accommodate that number of people, years in advance. Those contracts come with a lot of requirements, such as union labor, required vendors, and many more details (iykyk) that, in the end, amount to a hefty spend.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Python usage has continued to surge (which is wonderful!), but rather than keep pace, corporate investment back into the language and the community has declined overall. The PSF has longstanding sponsors and partners that we are ever grateful for, but signing on new corporate sponsors has slowed. We have been seeking out alternate revenue channels to diversify our income, with some success and some challenges. <a href="https://docs.pypi.org/organization-accounts/pricing-and-payments/" target="_blank">PyPI Organizations offers paid features to companies</a> (PyPI features are always free to community groups) and has begun bringing in monthly income.&nbsp;<br /><br />We’ve also been seeking out grant opportunities where we find good fits with our mission. We made it far along in one large U.S. Government grant process, but <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2025/10/NSF-funding-statement.html" target="_blank">ultimately decided to withdraw our application because it conflicted with our values and mission</a>. The community's supportive response to that decision has been heartening and brought in an unexpected surge of material support totaling $135K+ USD from 1400+ donors, which includes 270+ new PSF members! The PSF is astounded and deeply appreciative at the outpouring of solidarity in both words and actions. This remarkable show of support reminds the us of the community’s strength, and reinforces our resolve in the decision to withdraw from the grant process, even as the $1.5M gap from the grant remains.<br /><br />Our <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/annual-report/2024/" target="_blank">2024 Annual Impact Report</a> provides a window on the current economic outlook for the PSF, with a loss in net income and a dip in the growth of assets in 2024. Because we have so few expense categories (the vast majority of our spending goes to running PyCon US, the Grants Program, and our small 13-member staff), we have limited “levers to pull” when it comes to budgeting and long-term sustainability. As you can see from the categories mentioned, each of these expense areas leads directly to the services we provide the community. Additionally, we have several sources of assets with donor restrictions (i.e. earmarked funds), meaning we can’t shift those funds to cover other areas of need.&nbsp;</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiZPIx4i6NVY6f8AVHYRfZ94Tk5-dQRuVfT9G4f7ca2Os8q9d5qVbpdfR362immobVURI1JvV8ivZUpeO8owWUZUJ1TWL7FbS5quiYak-mQwN1UrtyU1U6By56QcKoDAiKHQvkjlvWa1MLXD4KNC0-dr_5aFBiex6DgEubx5FNP98iH3RQcSQ/s1056/PYTHON_annual_report_2024_digital-1.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="309" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiZPIx4i6NVY6f8AVHYRfZ94Tk5-dQRuVfT9G4f7ca2Os8q9d5qVbpdfR362immobVURI1JvV8ivZUpeO8owWUZUJ1TWL7FbS5quiYak-mQwN1UrtyU1U6By56QcKoDAiKHQvkjlvWa1MLXD4KNC0-dr_5aFBiex6DgEubx5FNP98iH3RQcSQ/w400-h309/PYTHON_annual_report_2024_digital-1.png" width="400" /></a></div><br />&nbsp;<p></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">What does this mean?&nbsp;</h2><p>Overall, the PSF is facing significant financial challenges, but we are actively monitoring the situation and taking action where we can. This post is our way of “raising the flag” early and calling in the community proactively. We currently have more than six months of runway (as opposed to our preferred 12 months+ of runway), so the PSF is not at immediate risk of having to make more dramatic changes, but we are on track to face difficult decisions if the situation doesn’t shift in the next year.&nbsp;</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">What we’re doing</h2>Based on all of this, the PSF has been making changes and working on multiple fronts to combat losses and work to ensure financial sustainability, in order to continue protecting and serving the community in the long term. Some of these changes and efforts include:<br /><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Pursuing new sponsors, specifically in the AI industry and the security sector</li><li>Increasing sponsorship package pricing to match inflation</li><li>Making adjustments to reduce PyCon US expenses</li><li>Pursuing funding opportunities in the US and Europe</li><li>Working with other organizations to raise awareness</li><li>Strategic planning, to ensure we are maximizing our impact for the community while cultivating mission-aligned revenue channels</li></ul>The PSF’s end-of-year fundraiser effort is usually run by staff based on their capacity, but this year we have assembled a fundraising team that includes Board members to put some more “oomph” behind the campaign. We’ll be doing our regular fundraising activities; we’ll also be creating a unique webpage, piloting temporary and VERY visible pop-ups to python.org and PyPI.org, and telling more stories from our Grants Program recipients.&nbsp;<br /><h2 style="text-align: left;">What you can do</h2><b>So, what can you do to help us gain sponsors to ensure critical infrastructure, our community, and more can stay supported and sustainable?</b><br /><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>If your company is using Python to build its products and services, check to see if they already sponsor the PSF on our <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/sponsors/" target="_blank">Sponsors page</a>.</li><li>If not, reach out to your organization's internal decision-makers and impress on them just how important it is for us to power the future of Python together, and send them <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/prospectus2026/" target="_blank">our sponsor prospectus</a>.</li><li>Point out the various benefits they will receive from sponsoring the PSF. Mention that <a href="https://us.pycon.org/" target="_blank">PyCon US 2026</a> is coming up next spring, where they can connect with the community, recruit, and understand the current direction of the Python language!</li><li>Remind them to reach out to sponsors@python.org if they have any questions or would like a walk-through of our sponsorship program.</li></ol>As the PSF prepares for our end-of-year fundraiser, we want to emphasize the importance of our community's support. Your relentless passion for Python and our community, along with your individual donations, memberships, stories, advocacy, and more, all make a huge impact and keep our tiny-but-mighty PSF team inspired. Keep your eyes on the <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">PSF Blog</a>, the <a href="https://discuss.python.org/c/python-software-foundation/9" target="_blank">PSF category on Discuss</a>, and <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2025/02/where-is-psf-2025-edition.html" target="_blank">our social media accounts</a> for updates and information as we kick off the fundraiser this month. Your boosts of our posts and your personal shares of “why I support the PSF” stories will make all the difference in our end-of-year fundraiser.&nbsp;<br /><br />If this post has you all fired up to personally support the future of Python and the PSF <b><i>right now</i></b>, we always welcome new <a href="https://psfmember.org/civicrm/contribute/transact/?reset=1&amp;id=1" target="_blank">PSF Supporting Members</a> and <a href="https://psfmember.org/civicrm/contribute/transact/?reset=1&amp;id=2" target="_blank">donations</a>.

        <!-- Content Section -->
        <div class="p-4 flex-grow overflow-hidden">
          <p class="text-base-content">
            <p>It&#8217;s probably no surprise to you that we&#8217;re building
<a href="https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents">agents</a>
somewhere.  Everybody does it.  Building a good agent, however, brings back
some of the historic challenges involving durable execution.</p>
<p>Entirely unsurprisingly, a lot of people are now building durable execution
systems.  Many of these, however, are incredibly complex and require you to
sign up for another third-party service.  I generally try to avoid bringing in
extra complexity if I can avoid it, so I wanted to see how far I can go with
just Postgres.  To this end, I wrote
<a href="https://github.com/earendil-works/absurd">Absurd</a> <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>, a tiny SQL-only
library with a very thin SDK to enable durable workflows on top of just
Postgres — no extension needed.</p>
<h2>Durable Execution 101</h2>
<p>Durable execution (or durable workflows) is a way to run long-lived, reliable
functions that can survive crashes, restarts, and network failures without losing
state or duplicating work.  Durable execution can be thought of as the combination
of a queue system and a state store that remembers the most recently seen execution state.</p>
<p>Because Postgres <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190530143429/https://www.2ndquadrant.com/en/blog/what-is-select-skip-locked-for-in-postgresql-9-5/">is excellent at
queues</a>
thanks to <code>SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED</code>, you can use it for the queue (e.g.,
with <a href="https://github.com/pgmq/pgmq">pgmq</a>).  And because it&#8217;s a database, you
can also use it to store the state.</p>
<p>The state is important.  With durable execution, instead of running your logic in
memory, the goal is to decompose a task into smaller pieces (step functions) and
record every step and decision.  When the process stops (whether it fails,
intentionally suspends, or a machine dies) the engine can replay those events to
restore the exact state and continue where it left off, as if nothing happened.</p>
<h2>Absurd At A High Level</h2>
<p>Absurd at the core is a single <code>.sql</code> file
(<a href="https://github.com/earendil-works/absurd/blob/main/sql/absurd.sql"><code>absurd.sql</code></a>)
which needs to be applied to a database of your choice.  That SQL file&#8217;s goal is
to move the complexity of SDKs into the database.  SDKs then make the
system convenient by abstracting the low-level operations in a way that
leverages the ergonomics of the language you are working with.</p>
<p>The system is very simple: A <em>task</em> dispatches onto a given <em>queue</em> from where
a <em>worker</em> picks it up to work on.  Tasks are subdivided into <em>steps</em>, which are
executed in sequence by the worker.  Tasks can be suspended or fail, and when
that happens, they execute again (a <em>run</em>).  The result of a step is stored in
the database (a <em>checkpoint</em>).  To avoid repeating work, checkpoints are
automatically loaded from the state storage in Postgres again.</p>
<p>Additionally, tasks can <em>sleep</em> or <em>suspend for events</em> and wait until they are
emitted.  Events are cached, which means they are race-free.</p>
<h2>With Agents</h2>
<p>What is the relationship of agents with workflows?  Normally, workflows are DAGs
defined by a human ahead of time.  AI agents, on the other hand, define their own
adventure as they go.  That means they are basically a workflow with
mostly a single step that iterates over changing state until it determines that
it has completed.  Absurd enables this by automatically counting up steps if they
are repeated:</p>

<p>This defines a single task named <code>my-agent</code>, and it has just a single step.  The
return value is the changed state, but the current state is passed in as an
argument.  Every time the step function is executed, the data is looked up first
from the checkpoint store.  The first checkpoint will be <code>iteration</code>, the second
<code>iteration#2</code>, <code>iteration#3</code>, etc.  Each state only stores the new messages it
generated, not the entire message history.</p>
<p>If a step fails, the task fails and will be retried.  And because of checkpoint
storage, if you crash in step 5, the first 4 steps will be loaded automatically
from the store.  Steps are never retried, only tasks.</p>
<p>How do you kick it off? Simply enqueue it:</p>

<h2>That&#8217;s it!</h2>
<p>Really, that&#8217;s it.  There is really not much to it.  It&#8217;s just a queue and a
state store — that&#8217;s all you need.  There is <a href="https://useworkflow.dev/">no compiler
plugin</a> and no <a href="https://www.inngest.com/">separate
service</a> or <a href="https://temporal.io/">whole runtime
integration</a>.  Just Postgres.  That&#8217;s not to throw shade
on these other solutions; they are great.  But not every problem necessarily
needs to scale to that level of complexity, and you can get quite far with much
less.  Particularly if you want to build software that other people should be
able to self-host, that might be quite appealing.</p>

            Throughout your open source journey, you have no doubt been interacting with the core development team of the projects to which you have been contributing. Have you ever wondered how people become core developers of a project? In this post, I share my journey to becoming a core developer of numpydoc.

            <p>There are many great ideas that I&rsquo;ve gotten from TDD, Lean, Pragmatic, and more.
For the past few years, I&rsquo;ve really wanted to write a book about TDD, with an emphasis on using Lean teachings to cut out all the waste, and then grow TDD into more of a project wide process.</p>
<p>To motivate myself to just get it done finally, I&rsquo;ve started.
And I&rsquo;m using a holistic project wide process.</p>

            Today, we’re talking about building real AI products with foundation models. Not toy demos, not vibes. We’ll get into the boring dashboards that save launches, evals that change your mind, and the shift from analyst to AI app builder. Our guide is Hugo Bowne-Anderson, educator, podcaster, and data scientist, who’s been in the trenches from scalable Python to LLM apps. If you care about shipping LLM features without burning the house down, stick around.
