            <p>The PSF’s Grants Program is a key plank in our charitable <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/mission/" target="_blank">mission</a>
 to promote, protect, and advance the Python programming language and to
 support and facilitate the growth of a diverse and international 
community of Python programmers. After much research, input, and 
analysis, the PSF is pleased to share the PSF Grants Program 2024 
Transparency Report. The report includes context, numbers, analysis, and
 next steps for the Program. <br /><br />Similar to our <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/05/psf-grants-program-2022-2023.html" target="_blank">PSF Grants Program 2022 &amp; 2023 Transparency Report</a>,
 this 2024 report reflects the outcome of a significant amount of work. 
There are some differences in the position we are in as we approached 
the development of this report: <br /></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>The 2022 &amp; 2023 report provided concrete areas for improvement</li><li>During 2024, a notable amount of focused PSF Staff time was dedicated to improving our Grants Program and the processes</li><li>The
 PSF received and awarded a record-breaking amount of grants in 2024, 
which resulted in the need to re-evaluate the Program’s goals and 
sustainability</li></ul><p>The data from 2024 was truly wonderful to
 see (many WOW’s and 🥳🥳 were shared among PSF Staff)– and we are so 
happy to share it with the community. The PSF is also excited to share 
that we achieved many of the goals we listed in the 2022 &amp; 2023 
report and believe this is a reflection of the focused work we undertook
 in 2024. Even with these wins, the PSF recognizes multiple 
opportunities to continue to improve the Program. We are also aware that
 our recent sustainability-focused changes to the Program will likely 
result in the need for additional improvements and adjustments. <br /><br />The
 PSF continues to feel it is important to acknowledge that individual 
Pythonistas, regional communities, and the broader community are behind 
these statistics and commentaries. This report reflects the outcome of 
thousands of hours of efforts over 2024, 2023, and 2022 by the Grants 
Workgroup, the PSF Board, Python organizers, and PSF Staff worldwide. 
The PSF truly values this opportunity to share information on the 
success and challenges of our Grants Program, all while honoring the 
hard work of everyone involved in making the program and our mission 
possible.<br /><br />This report was compiled by PSF Staff and reviewed by 
the PSF Board and Grants Workgroup. If you have questions, comments, or 
feedback about the Grants Program or this report, please email 
grants@python.org or attend a session of the <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/02/introducing-psf-grants-office-hours.html" target="_blank">Grants Program Office Hours</a> on the <a href="https://discord.gg/7rthGF3BBe" target="_blank">PSF Discord</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Setting Context</h2><p style="text-align: left;">The PSF has been working to improve our Grants Program since receiving <a href="https://pythonafrica.blogspot.com/2023/12/an-open-letter-to-python-software_5.html" target="_blank">a call from our community</a>
 to address concerns and frustrations in December 2023. Our 2022 &amp; 
2023 report listed the actions the PSF has taken since we first received
 the call, and we are happy to share that since publishing our last 
report, the PSF Board, Grants Workgroup, and Staff have:<br /></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Held monthly <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/02/introducing-psf-grants-office-hours.html" target="_blank">Grants Program Office Hours</a>
 (now past its 1st anniversary) with much success and active 
participation at every session, and we plan to continue these 
indefinitely!</li><li>Strategized at the <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/11/psf-board-retreat-2024.html" target="_blank">PSF Board retreat</a>, which resulted in <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/grants/#guiding-principles" target="_blank">Guiding Principles</a> for the Grants Program</li><li>Evaluated
 the Grants Program expenditure using grant data to conduct scenario 
analysis and ensure long-term program and foundation sustainability. </li><li>Updated the Grants Workgroup Charter twice: </li><ul><li>The first update was focused on process improvements (<a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/11/psf-grants-program-updates-part1.html" target="_blank">part 1</a>, <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/11/psf-grants-program-updates-part2.html" target="_blank">part 2</a>).</li><li>The second update was focused on sustainability (<a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/12/psf-grants-program-charter-updates-tldr.html" target="_blank">TLDR</a>, <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/12/psf-grants-program-charter-updates-part-1.html" target="_blank">part 1</a>, <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/12/psf-grants-program-charter-updates-part-2.html" target="_blank">part 2</a>, <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/12/12psf-grants-program-charter-updates-part-3.html" target="_blank">part 3</a>).</li></ul><li>Ensured active Grants Workgroup engagement by conducting a confirmation of the workgroup memberships.</li><li>Updated the <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/grants/" target="_blank">main documentation page</a> for the Grants Program to improve clarity around the program’s processes, requirements, and what applicants can expect.</li><li>Updated the <a href="https://psfmember.org/grant-proposals/" target="_blank">Grants Program application form</a>
 to clarify questions that caused confusion, and added more questions to
 help us better review applications and perform additional grant data 
analysis in the future.</li><li>Revamped the former virtual events resource page to be an <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/grants/free-resources/" target="_blank">Event Organizer Resource Library</a> to include more types of resources and information for grant applicants.</li></ul><p style="text-align: left;"><br />For a high-level idea of the scope of our Grants Program, the PSF is happy to share:<br /></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>The
 PSF distributed $952K in Grants during 2024 for the Grants and PyCon US
 Travel Grants Programs combined, an increase of over 50% over 2023’s 
total. </li><li>The Grants Program distributed $637K In Grants during 2024. </li></ul><p style="text-align: left;"><br />A couple of additional notes:<br /></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>This transparency report is focused on the Grants Program only. If you want to learn more about travel grants check out the <a href="https://pycon.blogspot.com/2025/03/travelgrants2025.html" target="_blank">Travel Grants Process for PyCon US 2025</a> blog post on the PyCon US blog. </li><li>Across
 this report and our communications about grants, “distributed” means 
funds that were paid, and “awarded” means funds that were resolved to be
 distributed. While a subtle difference, there can be discrepancies 
between “awarded” and “distributed” figures for several reasons, such as
 grant recipients that never claim their awards, or grants that were 
awarded at the end of December but weren’t paid until January. </li><li>We
 discovered a corner case on applications and how data is gathered for 
this report; applications that were received in 2023 but weren’t voted 
on until 2024 were not included in the 2022 &amp; 2023 report. Those are
 included in this report. The following report will be on the 119 grants
 that the PSF reviewed during the year 2024.</li></ul><p style="text-align: left;"><br />Again,
 the growth the PSF Grants Program has seen from 2022 to 2024 (and over the years) is 
exciting to reflect on because of what it means– you, the community, are
 wonderfully thriving and active! The PSF can’t wait to see what 2025 
has in store for our Grants Program and the Python community.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjSYGn5a5ABlECv02dZyW1uuIm8tFx3gmurcp9JCDmetilvB2Bvod921kW0sWBeyMbGX7DVTfKdd6UwjtCe-NfytV9mKFATJtXMA5POK3JXELfhNicwgSfHtc9ZtiDaTL4TiXfrq0hyfHQmh9_Hc9Trjs3UVsKUvWzpC1VAtDWC_LdFlZvcAw/s892/PSF_GrantTrends_2015-2024.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="245" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjSYGn5a5ABlECv02dZyW1uuIm8tFx3gmurcp9JCDmetilvB2Bvod921kW0sWBeyMbGX7DVTfKdd6UwjtCe-NfytV9mKFATJtXMA5POK3JXELfhNicwgSfHtc9ZtiDaTL4TiXfrq0hyfHQmh9_Hc9Trjs3UVsKUvWzpC1VAtDWC_LdFlZvcAw/w400-h245/PSF_GrantTrends_2015-2024.png" width="400" /></a></div><p style="text-align: left;"><br /></p>

<h2 style="text-align: left;">The numbers (in graph form)<br /></h2>
<p>

</p>
<p>
  <i>Thanks to Tania Allard for helping improve the readability and
    accessibility of the graphs provided in this report.</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Our Analysis<i>&nbsp;</i></h2><h4 style="text-align: left;">General Trends, Observations, &amp; Notes</h4><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>The increase in total grant applications we received from 2024 over 2023, and again over 2022, is exciting! We anticipated more applications coming in throughout 2024 and we were correct. With the recent changes to our Grants Program, the trends we’ve seen in Q1 of 2025, and the funding crunch in the tech sector, we anticipate receiving even more applications in 2025.</li><li>Beyond just more applications, we had more of a lot; more successful grant applications, more funds awarded, more communications, more changes to the Program, and more dedicated PSF Staff time! </li></ul><h4 style="text-align: left;">Number of Total Grant Applications by Continent</h4><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Similar to last year’s report, we received the most number of applications from Africa and Europe, with South America not far behind. </li><li>The number of grant applications from almost all continents have continued to increase 2024 over 2023, and have more than doubled over the total number of applications we received in 2022.</li></ul><h4 style="text-align: left;">Percentage of Grants Approved</h4><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>The percentage of approved applications increased 2024 over 2023. We feel this increase can be attributed to the direct line of communications applicants have to program administrators via the PSF Grants Program Office Hours. </li><li>Some reasons applications were denied include:</li><ul><li>Unable to meet PSF Grants Program criteria</li><li>Unclear benefit to funding the application</li><li>Not Python related</li><li>Spam</li></ul></ul><h4 style="text-align: left;">Percentage of Grant Applications by Continent</h4><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Again in 2024, we received fewer applications from Asia, North America, and Oceania. Oceania is an outlier. Based on the distribution of populations globally, the percentage of applications from Asia is lower than expected. While we want to note that we cannot award Grants to certain countries due to United States OFAC restrictions that US-based 501(c)(3)s must follow, we again urge organizers from Asia to request Grant funding to supplement and enhance their events. </li><li>While the number of applications we’ve received have continued to increase, the distribution of grant applications across continents has remained relatively stable from 2022-2024. We do want to note a small but steady increase in the percentage of grant applications from Africa and North America, and a small decrease in applications from South America.</li></ul><h4 style="text-align: left;">Approved &amp; Declined Grant Applications by Continent</h4><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>The ratio of approved to declined grant applications (87.5% approved, 12.5% declined in 2024) from Africa is positive, as this was a stated area for improvement in last year’s report (68% approved, 32% declined in 2023). We believe this can be at least partially attributed to the PSF Grants Program Office Hours, plus more communications regarding how the Program works and the changes occurring around it.</li></ul><h4 style="text-align: left;">Dollar Amount Granted by Continent &amp; Percentage of Money Granted by Continent</h4><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>The amount granted to Africa more than doubled 2024 over 2023, and more than 14 times the amount granted to Africa in 2022! As we also received the most grant applications from Africa in 2024, we feel this outcome is positive. </li><li>Comparing the percentages of grant applications by continent versus the percentages of money granted by continent, we feel it is positive that these percentages closely match (i.e. awarding of funds is roughly equivalent to the percentage of applications across continents) with a couple points of difference. </li><li>The total amount of funds granted doubled 2023 over 2022 and again almost doubled 2024 over 2023. This continued dramatic increase resulted in our recent changes to the Grants Program to ensure the program’s sustainability. </li><li>The amount of funds awarded to Asia and South America are low compared to other continents taking into account global population distributions. While this aligns with the number of applications we received from these regions (i.e. the percentage of funds awarded and percentage of accepted applications for these regions are close), we would like to understand if the low number of applications is due to activity level, lack of awareness, or other factors. </li></ul><h4 style="text-align: left;">Average Amount Granted by Continent</h4><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Oceania continues to be an outlier; the PSF received one application in 2022, two in 2023, and two in 2024 from Oceania. Many more grants were awarded to other regions, which caused their average dollar amounts to be lower. </li><li>The average dollar amount across the rest of the continents are reasonably close, and we are pleased to see the average amount granted to Africa has risen. </li><li>Asia and South America are still lagging behind, which could be attributed to the type of grant requests we receive from that region (such as Django Girls workshop versus PyCons) and the amounts being requested. And the reverse side of that– grant applications from North America tend to be for conferences and not workshops or small events, hence the larger average amount granted.</li></ul><h4 style="text-align: left;">Grant Decision Times in Weeks by Number &amp; Percentage of Applications</h4><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>We are pleased to see that the majority of the grant review period falls around 4 and 5 weeks, which is reasonable based on the process and load of grant applications we received. </li><li>When we reviewed applications that took longer than 6-8 weeks to decide, we found one scenario in particular continues to arise. Applications are sometimes submitted without crucial information, and there is significant time spent on communications between applicants, PSF Staff, and the Grants Workgroup. Once requested, there are can be delays in receiving the required information back from applicants. </li></ul><h4 style="text-align: left;">Grants Program Average Days to Decide by Continent</h4><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>The average days to decide across continents is generally similar, with a few exceptions for Asia and Oceania being shorter. This graph also shows Oceania as an outlier, and, again, it is skewed because we received only two applications in 2024 from that region. The average number of days to decide for grant applications for Asia was high in 2023 at 45 days, and we are pleased to see that decrease significantly in 2024 to 25 days. </li><li>We are pleased to see the average number of days to come to a decision regarding grant applications has decreased to 28 days in 2024 over 32 days in 2023. We feel this can be attributed to process improvements, Grants Workgroup engagement, and more dedicated time from PSF Staff.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Next steps and a final note</h2><p>As the PSF reflects on all the successes of the Grants Program in 2024, we are preparing ourselves for even more adjustments to come with the updated Program and Grants Workgroup Charter. Some of our goals for 2025 include:<br /></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Continue building the <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/grants/free-resources/" target="_blank">Event Organizer Resource Library</a>.</li><li>Continue hosting the Grants Program Office Hours to increase ongoing transparency, support grant applicants, and identify and close any gaps in our updated documentation.</li><li>Monitor and evaluate the Grants Program awards on a quarterly, bi-annual, and yearly basis to ensure Program and Foundation sustainability.</li><li>Revisit the effectiveness and sustainability of the Grants Program yearly. </li><li>Continue to analyze, discuss, and compare the actual state of our Grants Program against the Guiding Principles for the program. </li><li>Work to first understand why we are receiving a proportionately lower number of applications from Asia and South America. </li></ul><p><br />The PSF hopes this transparency report will help our community understand the state of our Grants Program in 2024, and the previous two years. Again, the process has been instructive to the Board, the Grants Workgroup, and the PSF Staff who administer the Program to understand where our efforts paid off, and where we can continue to improve. This report will inform our future efforts as we continue to make adjustments and improvements to the program. The PSF looks forward to continuing to serve the Python community with grants in 2025!<br /><br />If you have any questions, comments, or feedback, please email grants@python.org.

contexts can now be stored, optionally so they are shared by all projects, and may be used
independently with different AI features.</p>
<p>AI requests can now also be stored in the current project or shared with all projects, and Wing
comes preconfigured with a set of commonly used requests. In addition to changing code in the
current editor, stored requests may create a new untitled file or run instead in AI Chat. Wing
11 also introduces options for changing code within an editor, including replacing code,
commenting out code, or starting a diff/merge session to either accept or reject changes.</p>
<p>Wing 11 also supports using AI to generate commit messages based on the changes being committed
to a revision control system.</p>
<p>You can now also configure multiple AI providers for easier access to different models.</p>

<h3>Package Management with uv</h3><p>Wing Pro 11 adds support for the <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">uv</span></tt> package manager in the New Project dialog and the
Packages tool.</p>
<p>For details see <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Project</span> <span class="pre">Manager</span> <span class="pre">&gt;</span> <span class="pre">Creating</span> <span class="pre">Projects</span> <span class="pre">&gt;</span> <span class="pre">Creating</span> <span class="pre">Python</span> <span class="pre">Environments</span></tt> and <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Package</span>

<h3>Improved Python Code Analysis</h3><p>Wing 11 improves code analysis of literals such as dicts and sets, parametrized type
aliases, <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">typing.Self</span></tt>, type variables on the <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">def</span></tt> or <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">class</span></tt> line that declares
them, generic classes with <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">[...]</span></tt>, and <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">__all__</span></tt> in <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">*.pyi</span></tt> files.</p>
<h3>Updated Localizations</h3><p>Wing 11 updates the German, French, and Russian localizations, and introduces a new experimental
AI-generated Spanish localization. The Spanish localization and the new AI-generated strings in the
French and Russian localizations may be accessed with the new <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">User</span> <span class="pre">Interface</span> <span class="pre">&gt;</span> <span class="pre">Include</span> <span class="pre">AI</span>
<span class="pre">Translated</span> <span class="pre">Strings</span></tt> preference.</p>
<h3>Improved diff/merge</h3><p>Wing Pro 11 adds floating buttons directly between the editors to make navigating differences
and merging easier, allows undoing previously merged changes, and does a better job managing
scratch buffers, scroll locking, and sizing of merged ranges.</p>
<p>For details see <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Difference</span> <span class="pre">and</span> <span class="pre">Merge</span></tt> under <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Wing</span> <span class="pre">Manual</span></tt> in Wing 11's <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Help</span></tt> menu.</p>
<h3>Other Minor Features and Improvements</h3><p>Wing 11 also improves the custom key binding assignment user interface, adds a <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Files</span> <span class="pre">&gt;</span>
<span class="pre">Auto-Save</span> <span class="pre">Files</span> <span class="pre">When</span> <span class="pre">Wing</span> <span class="pre">Loses</span> <span class="pre">Focus</span></tt> preference, warns immediately when opening a project with
an invalid Python Executable configuration, allows clearing recent menus, expands the set of
available special environment variables for project configuration, and makes a number of other
bug fixes and usability improvements.</p>
<h3>Changes and Incompatibilities</h3><p>Since Wing 11 replaced the <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span></tt> tool with <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span> <span class="pre">Coder</span></tt> and <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span> <span class="pre">Chat</span></tt>, and AI
configuration is completely different than in Wing 10, you will need to reconfigure your
AI integration manually in Wing 11. This is done with <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Manage</span> <span class="pre">AI</span> <span class="pre">Providers</span></tt> in the
<tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span></tt> menu. After adding the first provider configuration, Wing will set that provider as
the default. You can switch between providers with <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Switch</span> <span class="pre">to</span> <span class="pre">Provider</span></tt> in the <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span></tt> menu.</p>

            Do you or your company need accounting software? Well, there are plenty of SaaS products out there that you can give your data to. but maybe you also really like Django and would rather have a foundation to build your own accounting system exactly as you need for your company or your product. On this episode, we're diving into Django Ledger, created by Miguel Sanda, which can do just that.

            <p>Last year I updated my <a href="https://treyhunner.com/2018/04/how-to-make-the-most-of-your-first-pycon/">having a great first PyCon</a> post to note that Mastodon would likely be more popular than Twitter at PyCon.</p>

<p>My guess was correct.
During PyCon US 2024, <a href="https://mastodon.social/@treyhunner/112453920848761679">Mastodon overtook Twitter</a> for the most posts on the <code>#PyConUS</code> hashtag.</p>

<p>In the fall of 2024, Bluesky really took off.
It currently seems like Bluesky is now a bit more popular than Mastodon for Python posts in general&hellip; but that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean it will be the most popular social media network during the conference.</p>

<p>This year I&rsquo;m guessing that Mastodon will still be the most popular network for <code>#PyConUS</code> posts, though I wouldn&rsquo;t be very surprised if Bluesky took the lead instead.</p>

<h2>What do the social networks think?</h2>

<p>I decided to pose this question to the various social networks via a poll. I made sure to share these polls using both the <code>#Python</code> and <code>#PyConUS</code> hashtags for visibility&rsquo;s sake.</p>

<p>The results?</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/treyhunner_pyconus-python-activity-7313960284581216256-DdzA/">LinkedIn poll</a>: LinkedIn isn&rsquo;t sure whether Twitter is the new Twitter</li>
<li><a href="https://x.com/treyhunner/status/1908187705965703323">Twitter poll</a> Twitter (mostly) knows that Bluesky is the new Twitter</li>
<li><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/trey.io/post/3llyswsgkut2h">Bluesky poll</a> Bluesky knows the really nerdy tech folks hang out on Mastodon</li>
<li><a href="https://mastodon.social/@treyhunner/114280595068705311">Mastodon poll</a> Mastodon loves itself above all else</li>
</ul>


<p>In other words, LinkedIn leans more toward Bluesky being the leader than Mastodon, Twitter leans toward Bluesky, but Bluesky and Mastodon both lean toward Mastodon being the leader during PyCon.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t mention Threads or other platforms because they didn&rsquo;t seem like real contenders given where the most active PyCon-attending Python-posting folks seem to hang out in 2025.</p>

<h2>The actual results</h2>

<p>Here are the actual results of the polls.</p>

<h2>We&rsquo;re still fragmented</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, regardless of which network is the leader this year during PyCon US, we&rsquo;re still going to be much more fragmented than we used to be. Twitter <em>was</em> the clear leader years ago and it very clearly isn&rsquo;t anymore&hellip; at least not for PyCon US conference chatter.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be checking Mastodon and Bluesky and will post on <em>at least</em> Mastodon and possibly also Bluesky. I hope that other folks will also use one of these 2 social networks to organize dinners and gatherings! 🤞</p>

<p>Feel free to follow me <a href="https://mastodon.social/@treyhunner">on Mastodon</a> and <a href="https://mastodon.social/@treyhunner">Bluesky</a> during the conference.</p>

<p>Also let me know if you&rsquo;d like to join my <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/trey.io/post/3ln45jpzmik2c">PyCon US starter pack</a> on Bluesky.
Lists on Mastodon require following and I prefer not to follow everyone I meet at PyCon so, unfortunately, I probably won&rsquo;t have a Mastodon equivalent of this. 😢</p>

<p>I recommend checking the <code>#PyConUS</code> hashtag on both networks as well.
Note that you can <em>subscribe</em> to hashtags on Mastodon which is pretty neat!</p>

<h2>See you at PyCon!</h2>

<p>If this will be your first PyCon US, I recommend signing up for both Mastodon and Bluesky and checking the <code>#PyConUS</code> hashtag during the conference.</p>

<p>Also, be sure to see my <a href="https://treyhunner.com/2018/04/how-to-make-the-most-of-your-first-pycon/">post on having a great first PyCon</a> and <a href="https://mastodon.social/@treyhunner/112448459788776426">see this additional tips</a>.</p>

            <p>Python regexes have a number of features that bring new power to text
manipulation.  I&#8217;m not talking about fancy matching features like negative
look-behinds, but ways you can construct and use regexes.  As a demonstration,
I&#8217;ll show you some real code from a real project.</p><p>Coverage.py will expand environment variables in values read from its
configuration files.  It does this with a function called
<code>substitute_variables</code>:</p><blockquote class="code"><pre class="python"><div class="source"><span class="k">def</span><span class="w">&#xa0;</span><span class="nf">substitute_variables</span><span class="p">(</span>

</pre></blockquote><p>This isn&#8217;t a super-fancy regex: it doesn&#8217;t use advanced pattern matching.
But there are some useful regex features at work here:</p><ul>

<li>The <code>(?x)</code> flag at the beginning turns on &#8220;verbose&#8221; regex syntax. In
this mode, all white space is ignored so the regex can be multi-line and we can
indent to help see the structure, and comments are allowed at the ends of
lines.</li>

<li>Named groups like <code>(?P&lt;word1&gt; … )</code> are used to capture parts of
the text that we can retrieve later by name.</li>

<li>There are also two groups used to get the precedence of operators right, but
we don&#8217;t want to capture those values separately, so I use the non-capturing
group syntax for them: <code>(?: … )</code>.  In this code, we only ever access groups
by name, so I could have left them as regular capturing groups, but I think it&#8217;s
clearer to indicate up-front that we won&#8217;t be using them.</li>

</ul><p>The verbose syntax in particular makes it easier to understand the regex.
Compare to what it would look like in one line:</p><blockquote class="code"><pre class="python"><div class="source"><span class="sa">r</span><span class="s2">&quot;\$(?:(?P&lt;dollar&gt;\$)|(?P&lt;word1&gt;\w+)|\{(?P&lt;word2&gt;\w+)(?:(?P&lt;strict&gt;\?)|-(?P&lt;defval&gt;[^}]*))?})&quot;</span>
<br /></div>
</pre></blockquote><p>Once we have the regex, we can use <code>re.sub()</code> to replace the variables
with their values:</p><blockquote class="code"><pre class="python"><div class="source"><span class="n">re</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">sub</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">dollar_pattern</span><span class="p">,</span>&#xa0;<span class="n">dollar_replace</span><span class="p">,</span>&#xa0;<span class="n">text</span><span class="p">)</span>
<br /></div>
</pre></blockquote><p>But we&#8217;re going to use another power feature of Python regexes:
<code>dollar_replace</code> here isn&#8217;t a string, it&#8217;s a function! Each fragment the
regex matches will be passed as a match object to our <code>dollar_replace</code>
function.  It returns a string which re.sub() uses as the replacement in the
text:</p><blockquote class="code"><pre class="python"><div class="source"><span class="k">def</span><span class="w">&#xa0;</span><span class="nf">dollar_replace</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">match</span><span class="p">:</span>&#xa0;<span class="n">re</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Match</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">])</span>&#xa0;<span class="o">-&gt;</span>&#xa0;<span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">:</span>
<br /><span class="w">&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;</span><span class="sd">&quot;&quot;&quot;Called&#xa0;for&#xa0;each&#xa0;$replacement.&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>

</pre></blockquote><p>First we use <code>match.group()</code>.  Called with a number of names, it returns
a tuple of what those named groups matched. They could be the matched text, or
None if the group didn&#8217;t match anything.</p><p>The way our regex is written only one of those three groups will match, so
the tuple will have one string and two None&#8217;s.  To get the matched string, we
use <code>next()</code> to find it. If the built-in <code>any()</code> returned the first
true thing it found this code could be simpler, but it doesn&#8217;t so we have to do
it this way.</p><p>Now we can check the value to decide on the replacement:</p><ul>
<li>If the match was a dollar sign, we return a dollar sign.</li>

<li>If the word is one of our defined variables, we return the value of the
variable.</li>

<li>Since the word isn&#8217;t a defined variable, we check if the &#8220;strict&#8221; marker was
found, and if so, raise an exception.</li>

<li>Otherwise we return the default value provided.</li>

</ul><p>The final piece of the implementation is to use <code>re.sub()</code> and return
the result:</p><blockquote class="code"><pre class="python"><div class="source"><span class="k">return</span>&#xa0;<span class="n">re</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">sub</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">dollar_pattern</span><span class="p">,</span>&#xa0;<span class="n">dollar_replace</span><span class="p">,</span>&#xa0;<span class="n">text</span><span class="p">)</span>
<br /></div>
</pre></blockquote><p>Regexes are often criticized for being too opaque and esoteric.  But done
right, they can be very powerful and don&#8217;t have to be a burden.  What we&#8217;ve done
here is used simple pattern matching paired with useful API features to
compactly write a useful transformation.</p><p>BTW, if you are interested, the <a href="https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/blob/master/coverage/misc.py#L228-L276" rel="external noopener">real code is in

            Calling all community organizers! We want to sit down together and share what’s going well, what new tricks we’ve learned, and what’s been challenging in the area of organizing Python and Python adjacent communities. So if you’re attending PyCon US this year and you run a local Python meet-up, help organize a regional conference, or facilitate peer learning through workshops or hack nights, we hope you will join us at the <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2025/events/community-organizers-summit/">Community Organizer Summit</a> and the <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2025/events/open-spaces/">PSF &amp; Meetups Discussion</a>.<br /><b><br />Community Organizer Summit:</b> 10:30 am - 1 pm on Saturday, May 17th<br /><b>PSF &amp; Meetups Discussion:</b> 1pm - 2pm on Sunday, May 18th<br /><br />Saturday’s Community Organizer Summit kicks off with a keynote and then three short “Show &amp; Tell” slots, for which <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2025/events/community-organizers-summit/">the CFP is open now</a>. After the more formal sessions, we’ll break into unconference discussions, so be sure to bring your ideas. If you’re not able to make it to Pittsburgh but you want to join the ongoing conversation about conference organizing, please consider joining the bi-monthly <a href="https://www.conferencechats.org/">Conference Chats</a> on Discord. Thanks so much to Mason Egger,  Heather White and Kevin Horn for organizing the Summit!<br /><br />Sunday’s PSF &amp; Meetups Discussion is organized by the PSF board and is intended to kick off a more collaborative and purposeful era of Python community organizer knowledge sharing! Community organizer meetups have been happening casually at PyCon US and (more famously) at EuroPython for a few years now. We’re looking to make this year’s PyCon US session into a jumping off point for a global conversation that we hope to see happen regularly in lots of places around the world, as well as online. If you’ve got ideas or want to be involved in this conversation, please email community-organizing@pyfound.org<br /><br />This is not just for experienced organizers! Looking to start a community and want to learn from a group of awesome people? Come join us!

    <h2>What are sets?</h2>
    
      
        <p>Like <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/what-are-lists/" target="_blank">lists</a>, <strong>sets are collections of values</strong>:</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">fruits</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="s2">"apples"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"strawberries"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"pears"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"apples"</span><span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>But unlike lists, <strong>sets can't contain duplicate values</strong>:</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">fruits</span>
<span class="go">{'apples', 'pears', 'strawberries'}</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>And sets are also <strong>unordered</strong>, meaning the values within a set may move around as new items are added to the set:</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">fruits</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">add</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"limes"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">fruits</span>
<span class="go">{'apples', 'pears', 'lime', 'strawberries'}</span>
</code></pre></div>

            <p>The conference starts days before the first official talk. There’s topic-specific summits, sponsor presentations, and deep-dive tutorials that are definitely worth checking out. Similarly, the conference does not end with the last talk. For the next four days, groups of enthusiasts rally around their projects and sprint on making them better in person. Some say it’s the best part of the conference, actually. Let’s take a closer look then!</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Who organizes the sprints?</h3><p>Sprints at PyCon US are organized by the attendees. The conference provides the space with tables, power strips, Internet connectivity, and, for the first two days, catered lunches. The attendees band together to work on their open-source and community projects of choice.<br /><br />You can expect bigger projects like CPython, Django, Flask, or BeeWare, to have their own dedicated rooms to hack on their stuff. Smaller projects either group together topically or just join a random friendly room with empty seats.<br /><br />Of course, the general <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2025/about/health-safety-guidelines/">rules around health and safety</a> apply to the sprints as well. Same goes for the <a href="https://policies.python.org/us.pycon.org/code-of-conduct/">code of conduct</a>. PyCon US staff is still around during sprints, so you can talk to them or to the Sprints chairs, <a href="mailto:tania@python.org">Tania Allard</a> and <a href="mailto:cheuk@python.org">Cheuk Ting Ho</a>, if you need any help.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Who comes to sprints? Do I need to come for 4 days?</h3><p>You’ll find project maintainers, seasoned contributors, community organizers, and first-time contributors alike. Everybody’s welcome!<br /><br />Most don’t stay for all four days, so understandably, everybody wants to maximize what they get out of the experience. So come prepared. Especially if you’re only coming for a single day. Our recommendation would be to stay for at least two, this gives it enough time to set everything up and actually create a pull request with a bugfix or feature.<br /><br />But if you can only spare one day, that’s fine, too. Let’s cover some ways in which you can make your experience the best.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Which project should I join for sprints?</h3><p>This is a question worth answering before coming. Sprints work best for contributors who are already users of a given project. If you know a project like, say, CPython or Django well enough, you probably stumbled upon a bug in that software in the past. Maybe you looked into how some internals of that software work. Maybe you thought about making a change to it in the past. Or maybe you at least saw enough tracebacks that you feel somewhat familiar with the software you’re using.<br /><br />The most impactful way to participate in sprints is to choose a project you’re familiar with, at least as a user. The project maintainers who come to sprints are helpful people and want you to succeed with your contribution. Meet them halfway and choose a project you already use. There’s not enough time during the sprints for maintainers to install software for the first time and explain how it works on somebody else’s laptop.<br /><br />Of course, there’s going to be exceptions to every rule. If you first learned about some library or framework at the conference and you’re very excited to get involved, by all means join the sprint for that project!</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">First PR to CPython</h3><p style="text-align: left;">For CPython in particular, the maintainers at the sprint recommend that sprint attendees have at least 2 years of experience as users of the Python programming language. A sprint isn’t the best place to learn the basics of programming. But it’s totally okay to be new at contributing to Python. In fact, this year we’ll be trying something new: a dedicated space for first-time contributors to CPython to make sure the experts around you are best-equipped to help you get your first pull request merged. Look for the dedicated “First PR to CPython” signage on the sprint room list.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Are there any easy issues to work on?</h3><p>This depends on the project. Some issue trackers contain issues marked as “easy” or “help wanted”. You can look at those first. Sometimes such issues are a bit of a trap. When an “easy” issue is still open 3+ years later, it often means there’s something not particularly easy about it.<br /><br />Asking the maintainers present at the sprint for an issue to fix is another way to get something to work on. That will often mean that you’ll get involved with whatever that maintainer already planned to work on. This might be super interesting or pretty boring to you, depending on what that particular topic area is.<br /><br />So the best way to find an issue to work on is to scratch your own itch. Fix that bug you also stumbled upon. Add this thing you once wished a library had. Open the list of issues in a library you used last week. Maybe you’ll be able to reproduce a problem, add a test, and fix it.<br /><br />In fact, a related cool way to get involved is to have a laptop with an environment that the maintainer usually doesn’t work with. If you see issues on the tracker that need reproducing on Windows or macOS or FreeBSD and this just happens to be the platform that you’re on right now, that’s perfect!</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Speak up!</h3><p>Sprints are different from tutorials and talks. Everybody, including the experts in the room, hunker down and work on something. If you get stuck with an issue, others around you will probably not notice. A good rule of thumb is to fight with an issue for 45 minutes, and if you’re not making progress, let others know where you’re stuck. They might be able to help unblock you.<br /><br />Some maintainers will suggest pair programming, or will be open to the idea if you suggest it. So that’s a thing you can try as well if you’re both interested in solving a particular problem.<br /><br />Sometimes two newcomers band together to work on a single issue. This can also be a good strategy and it’s more fun to attack a problem with another person interested in solving it.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Preparing your work environment</h3><p>While the conference is ready for even a large cohort of sprinters to all access wifi at the same time during sprints, it’s best to avoid the network congestion on the first day when a lot of people first “git clone” their projects.<br /><br />If you know the project you want to contribute to, clone their repository before coming. Try to build it and run tests. Even if they’re failing for you, you are already way ahead.<br /><br />If you don’t have a project chosen yet, you can still prepare a few things in advance. Install and configure your text editor of choice, and if you already have one, run a round of updates before coming. If you’re using any system-wide package manager like Apt or Homebrew, updating your installed packages before coming is a good idea.<br /><br />Keep in mind that you will be working with other people. If you have a privacy screen on your laptop, it might be helpful to get rid of it for the time of the sprint. Or bring a different device. If you keep your terminal font size tiny to fit a ton of information on screen, you might want to figure out how to increase that font temporarily at least for the sprints so people you collaborate with can see what’s going on. This also applies to text editors and their color schemes. Think about your display brightness.<br /><br />Similarly, if your keyboard layout is esoteric, it will make it harder for others to type on your laptop if you need help. Maybe you can find a quick way to toggle between layouts to allow others to write stuff.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Stay safe</h3><p>The following section might sound a bit scary, but we’re sharing it as common-sense advice for any large gathering of industry professionals where technology is widely actively used. Don’t let it deter you from coming!<br /><br />First things first. Backup your system before coming to the event. You might drop it, you might spill liquid on it, you might leave it at a restaurant or issue just the wrong command on the terminal in the heat of the moment and lose your data. They are all unlikely events, but they all happen at conferences. Backup your system.<br /><br />This is a large event. People are generally nice and helpful. But if you leave your laptop or phone unattended, somebody might take it, deliberately or not. If you do decide to leave your hardware at the table, put some unique stickers on it, so people don’t mistake it for their own. This is especially effective when it comes to smaller accessories like laptop chargers. If you’re in need for stickers, you’ll find lots of them in the expo hall during the conference!<br /><br />Finally, don’t get hacked. You will be active on a conference-wide network. Keep your system up-to-date, don’t bring laptops with legacy operating systems that are no longer receiving security updates. Unless you know and trust the person you’re interacting with, be vigilant about system-wide software they want you to install and settings they want you to change. Don’t allow strangers to connect devices to your laptop or phone, whether they’re thumb drives, keyboards, slide clickers, USB-C chargers, or anything else.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Have fun!</h3><p>If everything above sounds like a lot, it’s only because it’s a list of tips gained through 15 years of experience attending sprints at programming conferences. It’s there to allow you to prepare, but don’t overthink it! Join us, you might really love it.<br /><br />Sprints are fun, surprisingly productive, and sometimes spark big things! We also can’t overstate the importance of putting a face to a name. “Don’t be a stranger” is good advice. Connecting a GitHub account name with a good experience you had at a conference is a great way to build trust and fast-track online collaboration in the future!<br /><br />And that’s that. The mysterious sprints demystified! Come and see for yourself whether they’re really the best part of PyCon US. <br /></p><p>Guest post by Łukasz Langa <br /></p>

Every year, we ask to fill over 300 onsite volunteer hours to ensure everything runs smoothly at the event. And the best part? You don't need to commit a lot of time to make a difference– some shifts are as short as 45 minutes long! You can sign up for as many or as few shifts as you’d like. Even a couple of hours of your time can go a long way in helping us create an amazing experience for attendees.<br /><br />Keep in mind that you need to be <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2025/attend/information/">registered for the conference</a> to sign up for a volunteer role.<br /><br />One important way to get involved is to sign up as a <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2025/volunteer/session-staff/">Session Chair or Session Runner</a>. This is an excellent opportunity to meet and interact with speakers while helping to ensure that sessions run smoothly. And who knows, you might just learn something new along the way! You can sign up for these roles directly on the <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2025/schedule/talks/">Talks schedule</a>.<br /><br />Volunteer your time at PyCon US 2025 and you’ll be part of a fantastic community that's passionate about Python programming and help us make this year's conference a huge success. <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2025/schedule/volunteering/">Sign up today for the shifts that call to you and join the fun!</a><div><h1 style="text-align: left;">Hatchery Program</h1>First introduced in 2018, <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2025/events/hatchery/">Hatchery program</a> offers the pathways for PyCon US attendees to introduce new tracks, activities, summits, demos, etc., at the conference—activities that all share and fulfill the<a href="https://www.python.org/psf/mission/"> Python Software Foundation’s mission</a> within the PyCon US schedule.<br /><br />Since its introduction, this program has “hatched” several new tracks that are now staples of our conference, including PyCon US Charlas, Mentored Sprints, and the Maintainer’s Summit. This year, we’ve received eight very compelling proposals.

Are you curious about data science? Taking the first steps in this area is hard, but you don’t have to do it alone. Join our workshop for complete beginners and get started in Python data science - even if you’ve never written a single line of code!<br /><br />We invite those from underrepresented groups to join us for a fun, supportive workshop that will give you the confidence to get started in this exciting area. You can expect plenty of exercises, as well as inspiring talks from those who were once in your shoes. You’ll cover the basics of programming in Python, as well as useful libraries and tools such as Jupyter notebooks, pandas, and Matplotlib.<br /><br />In this hands-on workshop, you’ll work through a series of beginner-friendly materials at your own pace. You’ll work within small groups, each with an assigned mentor, who will be there to help you with any questions or whenever you get stuck. All you’ll need to bring is a laptop that can connect to the internet and a willingness to learn!<br /><br />Humble Data aims to increase inclusivity and provide a safe community for Python and Data Science. We organise free workshops for people who are outside of the mainstream in the data science and tech industry. We encourage past participants to become mentors and even organise their own workshop one day. We are building a community where people can help and learn from each other. Remember to stay humble!
