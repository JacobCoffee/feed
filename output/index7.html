            <p>I'm pleased to announce the release of Python 3.13 beta 4.<br /><br /><a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3130b4/">https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3130b4/</a></p>

<h1 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">&nbsp;</span></h1><h1 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">This is a beta preview of Python 3.13</span></h1>
<p>Python 3.13 is still in development.  This release, 3.13.0b4, is the <strong>final</strong> beta release preview of 3.13.</p>
<p>Beta release previews are intended to give the wider community the 
opportunity to test new features and bug fixes and to prepare their 
projects to support the new feature release.</p>
<p>We <strong>strongly encourage</strong> maintainers of third-party Python projects to <strong>test with 3.13</strong> during the beta phase and report issues found to <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues">the Python bug tracker</a>
 as soon as possible.  While the release is planned to be feature 
complete entering the beta phase, it is possible that features may be 
modified or, in rare cases, deleted up until the start of the release 
candidate phase (Tuesday 2024-07-30).  Our goal is to have <strong>no ABI changes</strong>
 after this final beta release, and as few code changes as possible 
after 3.13.0rc1, the first release candidate.  To achieve that, it will 
be <strong>extremely important</strong> to get as much exposure for 3.13 as possible during the beta phase.</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that this is a preview release and its use is <strong>not</strong> recommended for production environments.</p>

            <p>The 2024 election for the PSF Board and proposed Bylaws changes created an opportunity for conversations about the PSF's work to serve the global Python community. We appreciate community members' perspectives, passion, and engagement in the election process this year.</p><p>We want to send a big thanks to everyone who ran and was willing to serve on the PSF Board. Even if you were not elected, we appreciate all the time and effort you put into thinking about how to improve the PSF and represent the parts of the community you participate in. We hope that you will continue to think about these issues, share your ideas, and join a PSF Work Group if you feel called to do so.</p><h4 style="text-align: left;">Board Members Elect</h4><p>Congratulations to our three new Board members who have been elected! <br /></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Tania Allard</li><li>KwonHan Bae</li><li>Cristián Maureira-Fredes</li></ul><p>We’ll be in touch with all the elected candidates shortly to schedule onboarding. Newly elected PSF Board members are provided orientation for their service and will be joining the upcoming board meeting. </p><h4 style="text-align: left;">PSF Bylaw Changes</h4><p>All three of the proposed PSF Bylaw changes are approved:<br /></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li><a href="https://github.com/python/psf-bylaws/compare/a35a6071de181adbb7a160d5d1447e7b0272359c...359cbc540f2f6bf00bc46b9dbe3e00a950612c27" target="_blank">Merging Contributing and Managing member classes</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/python/psf-bylaws/compare/a35a6071de181adbb7a160d5d1447e7b0272359c...6bac449" target="_blank">Simplifying the voter affirmation process by treating past voting activity as intent to continue voting</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/python/psf-bylaws/compare/a35a6071de181adbb7a160d5d1447e7b0272359c...5b24dd2" target="_blank">Allow for removal of Fellows by a Board vote in response to Code of Conduct violations, removing the need for a vote of the membership</a></li></ul><p>We appreciate the high level of engagement on the proposed Bylaw changes, and the range of perspectives and points that were raised. We hope that our efforts towards increased transparency, such as <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/06/faq-for-proposed-changes-to-psf-bylaws.html" target="_blank">the Office Hour session, and our responses in the FAQ</a> helped to continue to build trust with the community. Our goal with these changes continues to be: <br /></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Making it simpler to qualify as a Member for Python-related volunteer work</li><li>Making it easier to vote</li><li>Allowing the Board more options to keep our membership safe and enforce the Code of Conduct</li></ul><p>This announcement serves as notice that the Bylaws changes have been approved by the membership, and will automatically go into effect 15 days from now, on Thursday, August 1st, 2024. </p><h4 style="text-align: left;">Thank you!</h4><p>We’d like to take this opportunity to thank our outgoing board member, Débora Azevedo, for her outstanding service. Débora served on the PSF Board through a particularly eventful time; bringing PyCon US into an age of hybrid events, responding to calls from our community for transparency, and hiring multiple new staff members to continue to improve our organization. Thank you for supporting the PSF and the Python community through so much change- you are appreciated!<br /><br />Our heartfelt thanks go out to each of you who took the time to review the candidates and submit your votes. Your participation helps the PSF represent our community. We received 611 total votes, easily reaching quorum–1/3 of affirmed voting members (794). We’re especially grateful for your patience with continuing to navigate the changes to the voting process, which allows for a valid election and a more sustainable election system.<br /><br />We also want to thank everyone who helped promote this year’s board election, especially Board Members Denny Perez and Georgi Ker, who took the initiative to cover this year’s election and produced informational videos for our candidates. This promotional effort was inspired by the work of <a href="https://pythoncommunitynews.com/" target="_blank">Python Community News</a> last year. We also want to highlight the PSF staff members and PSF Board members who put in tons of effort each year as we work to continually improve the PSF elections.<br /></p><h4 style="text-align: left;">What’s next?</h4><p>If you’re interested in the complete tally, make sure to check the <a href="https://opavote.com/results/5004101476679680" target="_blank">Python Software Foundation Board of Directors Election 2024 Results</a> page. These results will be available until 10 Sep 2024 at 10:00 AM EDT.</p><p>The PSF Election team will conduct a retrospective of this year’s election process to ensure we are improving year over year. We received valuable feedback about the process and tooling. We hope to be able to implement changes for next year to ensure a smooth and accessible election process for everyone in our community.</p><p>Finally, it might feel a little early to mention this, but we will have at least 4 seats open again next year. If you're interested in running or learning more, we encourage you to contact a current PSF Board member or two this year and ask them about their experience serving on the board.<br /><br /></p>

<p>At the beginning one goes to the conferences to listen to the talks and make
new contacts. You meet a lot of new faces every time. Over time a few of them
will become great friends and then all conferences will become about friends.</p>
<p>We wait for the conferences so that we can meet our friends. I went back to
PyCon US this year after 5 years, means I met many friends after 5 years. It
was so happy feeling to see them again.</p>
<p>Last week I went to my first ever <a href="https://ep2024.europython.eu/">Euro Python</a>
in Prague, finally the visa was good in the right days of the year. This means
I managed to meet more friends, a few of them just after a month (as they were
present in PyCon US) and some after many many years. Really enjoyed the social
event place selections by the organizers. </p>
<p>Personally the social events allowed me to go full scale nerd out on technical
and social issues with friends. I was really missing these discussions. Heard
more stories and discussed about fun ideas. One is below :)</p>

          <p class="text-base-content">
            <p>In June I was at the <a href="https://pldi24.sigplan.org/">PLDI conference</a> in
Copenhagen to present a <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3652588.3663316">paper</a>
I co-authored with <a href="https://bernsteinbear.com/">Max Bernstein</a>. I also finally
met <a href="https://blog.regehr.org/">John Regehr</a>, who I'd been talking on social
media for ages but had never met. John has been working on compiler correctness
and better techniques for building compilers and optimizers since a very long
time. The blog post <a href="https://www.pypy.org/posts/2022/12/jit-bug-finding-smt-fuzzing.html">Finding JIT Optimizer Bugs using SMT Solvers and
Fuzzing</a>
was heavily inspired by this work. We talked a lot about his and his groups
work on using Z3 for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superoptimization">superoptimization</a> and for
finding missing optimizations. I have applied some of the things John told me
about to the traces of PyPy's JIT, and wanted to blog about that. However, my
draft felt quite hard to understand. Therefore I have now written this current
post, to at least try to provide a somewhat gentler on-ramp to the topic.</p>
<p>In <em>this</em> post we will use the Python-API to Z3 to find local peephole rewrite
rules for the operations in the intermediate representation of PyPy's tracing
JIT. The code for this is simple enough that we can go through all of it.</p>
<p>The PyPy JIT produces traces of machine level instructions, which are optimized
and then turned into machine code. The optimizer uses a number of approaches to
make the traces more efficient. For integer operations it applies a number of
arithmetic simplification rules rules, for example <code>int_add(x, 0) -&gt; x</code>. When
implementing these rules in the JIT there are <strong>two problems</strong>: How do we know
that the rules are correct? And how do we know that we haven't forgotten any
rules? We'll try to answer both of these, but the first one in particular.</p>
<p>We'll be using Z3, a satisfiability module theories (SMT) solver which has good
bitvector support and most importantly an excellent Python API. We can use the
solver to reason about bitvectors, which are how we will model machine
integers.</p>
<p>To find rewrite rules, we will consider the binary operations (i.e. those
taking two arguments) in PyPy traces that take and produce integers. The
completely general form <code>op(x, y)</code> is not simplifiable on its own. But if
either <code>x == y</code>
or if one of the arguments is a constant, we can potentially simplify the
operation into a simpler form. The results are either the variable <code>x</code>, or a
(potentially different) constant. We'll ignore constant-folding where both
arguments of the binary operation are constants. The possible results for a
simplifiable binary operation are the variable <code>x</code> or another constant. This
leaves the following patterns as possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>op(x, x) == x</code></li>
<li><code>op(x, x) == c1</code></li>
<li><code>op(x, c1) == x</code></li>
<li><code>op(c1, x) == x</code></li>
<li><code>op(x, c1) == c2</code></li>
<li><code>op(c1, x) == c2</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Our approach will be to take every single supported binary integer operation,
instantiate all of these patterns, and try to ask Z3 whether the resulting
simplification is valid for all values of <code>x</code>.</p>
<h3 id="quick-intro-to-the-z3-python-api">Quick intro to the Z3 Python-API</h3>
<p>Here's a terminal session showing the use of the Z3 Python API:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="go">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; import z3</span>
<span class="go">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; # construct a Z3 bitvector variable of width 8, with name x:</span>

<p>Z3 checks the "satisfiability" of a formula. This means that it tries to find
an example set of concrete values for the variables that occur in a formula,
such that the formula becomes true. Examples:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="go">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; solver = z3.Solver()</span>
<span class="go">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; solver.check(x * x == 3)</span>
<span class="go">unsat</span>
<span class="go">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; # meaning no x fulfils this property</span>
<span class="go">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</span>
<span class="go">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; solver.check(x * x == 9)</span>
<span class="go">sat</span>
<span class="go">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; model = solver.model()</span>
<span class="go">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; model</span>
<span class="go">[x = 253]</span>
<span class="go">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; model[x].as_signed_long()</span>
<span class="go">-3</span>
<span class="go">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; # 253 is the same as -3 in two's complement arithmetic with 8 bits</span>
</pre></div>

<p>In order to use Z3 to prove something, we can ask Z3 to find counterexamples
for the statement, meaning concrete values that would make the negation of the
statement true:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="go">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; solver.check(z3.Not(x ^ -1 == ~x))</span>
<span class="go">unsat</span>
</pre></div>

<p>The result <code>unsat</code> means that we just proved that <code>x ^ -1 == ~x</code> is true for
all <code>x</code>, because there is no value for <code>x</code> that makes <code>not (x ^ -1 == ~x)</code>
true (this works because -1 has all the bits set).</p>
<p>If we try to prove something incorrect in this way, the following happens:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="go">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; solver.check(z3.Not(x ^ -1 == x))</span>
<span class="go">sat</span>
</pre></div>

<p><code>sat</code> shows that <code>x ^ -1 == x</code> is (unsurprisingly) not always true, and we can
ask for a counterexample:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="go">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; solver.model()</span>
<span class="go">[x = 0]</span>
</pre></div>

<p>This way of proving this works because the <code>check</code> calls try to solve an
(implicit) "exists" quantifier, over all the Z3 variables used in the formula.
<code>check</code> will either return <code>z3.unsat</code>, which means that no concrete values make
the formula true; or <code>z3.sat</code>, which means that you can get some concrete
values that make the formula true by calling <code>solver.model()</code>.</p>
<p>In math terms we prove things using <code>check</code> by de-Morgan's rules for quantifiers:</p>
<p>$$ \lnot \exists x: \lnot f(x) \implies \forall x: f(x) $$</p>
<p>Now that we've seen the basics of using the Z3 API on a few small examples,
we'll use it in a bigger program.</p>
<h3 id="encoding-the-integer-operations-of-rpythons-jit-into-z3-formulas">Encoding the integer operations of RPython's JIT into Z3 formulas</h3>
<p>Now we'll use the API to reason about the integer operations of the PyPy JIT
intermediate representation (IR). The binary integer operations are:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="n">opnames2</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span>

<span class="s2">"int_pymod"</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="p">]</span>
</pre></div>

<p>There's not much special about the integer operations. Like in LLVM, most of
them are signedness-independent: <code>int_add</code>, <code>int_sub</code>, <code>int_mul</code>, ... work
correctly for unsigned integers but also for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement">two's-complement</a> signed
integers. Exceptions for that are order comparisons like <code>int_lt</code> etc. for
which we have unsigned variants <code>uint_lt</code> etc. All operations that produce a
boolean result return a full-width integer <code>0</code> or <code>1</code> (the PyPy JIT supports
only word-sized integers in its intermediate representation)</p>
<p>In order to reason about the IR operations, some ground work:</p>

<p>We map the semantics of a PyPy JIT operation to Z3 with the <code>z3_expression</code>
function. It takes the name of a JIT operation and its two (or one) arguments
into a pair of Z3 formulas, <code>result</code> and <code>valid_if</code>. The resulting formulas are
constructed with the operator overloading of Z3 variables/formulas.</p>
<p>The first element <code>result</code> of the result of <code>z3_expression</code> represents the result
of performing the operation. <code>valid_if</code> is a bool that represents a condition that
needs to be <code>True</code> in order for the result of the operation to be defined. E.g.
<code>int_pydiv(a, b)</code> is only valid if <code>b != 0</code>. Most operations are always valid,
so they return <code>True</code> as that condition (we'll ignore <code>valid_if</code> for a bit, but it
will become more relevant further down in the post).</p>
<p>We can define a helper function to prove things by finding counterexamples:</p>

<h3 id="finding-rewrite-rules">Finding rewrite rules</h3>
<p>Now we can start finding our first rewrite rules, following the first pattern
<code>op(x, x) -&gt; x</code>. We do this by iterating over all the supported binary
operation names, getting the z3 expression for <code>op(x, x)</code> and then asking Z3 to
prove <code>op(x, x) == x</code>.</p>

<h3 id="synthesizing-constants">Synthesizing constants</h3>
<p>Supporting the next patterns is harder: <code>op(x, x) == c1</code>, <code>op(x, c1) == x</code>, and
<code>op(c1, x) == x</code>. We don't know which constants to pick to try to get Z3 to
prove the equality. We could iterate over common constants like <code>0</code>, <code>1</code>,
<code>MAXINT</code>, etc, or even over all the 256 values for a bitvector of length 8.
However, we will instead ask Z3 to find the constants for us too.</p>
<p>This can be done by using quantifiers, in this case <code>z3.ForAll</code>. The query we
pose to Z3 is "does there exist a constant <code>c1</code> such that for all <code>x</code> the
following is true: <code>op(x, c1) == x</code>? Note that the constant <code>c1</code> is not
necessarily unique, there could be many of them. We generate several matching
constant, and add that they must be different to the condition of the second
and further queries.</p>
<p>We can express this in a helper function:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">find_constant</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">z3expr</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">number_of_results</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">):</span>

<h3 id="synthesizing-two-constants">Synthesizing two constants</h3>
<p>For the patterns <code>op(x, c1) == c2</code> and <code>op(c1, x) == c2</code> we need to synthesize
two constants. We can again write a helper method for that:</p>

<p>A few require a bit more thinking:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="n">int_or</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span>

</pre></div>

<p>The are true because in two's complement, <code>-1</code> has all bits set.</p>
<p>The following ones require recognizing that <code>-9223372036854775808 == -2**63</code> is
the most negative signed 64-bit integer, and <code>9223372036854775807 == 2 ** 63 -
1</code> is the most positive one:</p>

<h3 id="strength-reductions">Strength Reductions</h3>
<p>All the patterns so far only had a variable or a constant on the target of the
rewrite. We can also use the machinery to do strengh-reductions where we
generate a single-argument operation <code>op1(x)</code> for input operations <code>op(x, c1)</code>
or <code>op(c1, x)</code>. To achieve this, we try all combinations of binary and unary
operations. (We won't consider strength reductions where a binary operation
gets turned into a "cheaper" other binary operation here.)</p>

<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>
<p>With not very little code we managed to generate a whole lot of local
simplifications for integer operations in the IR of PyPy's JIT. The rules
discovered that way are "simple", in the sense that they only require looking
at a single instruction, and not where the arguments of that instruction came
from. They also don't require any knowledge about the properties of the
arguments of the instructions (e.g. that they are positive).</p>
<p>The rewrites in this post have mostly been in PyPy's JIT already. But now we
mechanically confirmed that they are correct. I've also added the remaining
useful looking ones, in particular <code>int_eq(x, 0) -&gt; int_is_zero(x)</code> etc.</p>
<p>If we wanted to scale this approach up, we would have to work much harder!
There are a bunch of problems that come with generalizing the approach to
looking at sequences of instructions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Combinatorial explosion: if we look at sequences of instructions, we very
  quickly get a combinatorial explosion and it becomes untractable to try all
  combinations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finding non-minimal patterns: Some complicated simplifications can be
  instances of simpler ones. For example, because <code>int_add(x, 0) -&gt; x</code>, it's
  also true that <code>int_add(int_sub(x, y), 0) -&gt; int_sub(x, y)</code>. If we simply
  generate all possible sequences, we will find the latter simplification rule,
  which we would usually not care about.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unclear usefulness: if we simply generate all rewrites up to a certain number
  of instructions, we will get a lot of patterns that are useless in the sense
  that they typically aren't found in realistic programs. It would be much
  better to somehow focus on the patterns that real benchmarks are using.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.pypy.org/posts/2024/07/mining-jit-traces-missing-optimizations-z3.html">next blog post</a> I'll discuss an alternative approach to simply generating
all possible sequences of instructions, that tries to address these problems.
This works by analyzing the real traces of benchmarks and mining those for
inefficiencies, which only shows problems that occur in actual programs.</p>

The Python Software Foundation committed to hiring to increase this capacity in April and we’re excited to have Maria on board to begin providing crucially needed support.</span></span></p></span><p></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"></span></span></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiQGpPAAP5MvvslbmTukVKnZdYch87AA0ya3qoyAPFNhPncEMaeK3WidlNofLAP52lQzBnaEO7z05uH238PsqCYGy5uA8N1xFuK5sF6KaPfwSx92ZSMSSy7qr7COdNVyxeAXh4qTqzsjcqKfUqVFk8HbvYXA0lgJd9_e043s19R8n5GwjAVx6U" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="" height="240" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiQGpPAAP5MvvslbmTukVKnZdYch87AA0ya3qoyAPFNhPncEMaeK3WidlNofLAP52lQzBnaEO7z05uH238PsqCYGy5uA8N1xFuK5sF6KaPfwSx92ZSMSSy7qr7COdNVyxeAXh4qTqzsjcqKfUqVFk8HbvYXA0lgJd9_e043s19R8n5GwjAVx6U" width="191" /></a></span></span></div><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"><br /></span></span><p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">From Maria, <i>“I am a firm believer in democratizing tech.

    <h2>Lists are ordered collections</h2>
    
      
        <p>This is a list:</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">colors</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">"purple"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"green"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"blue"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"yellow"</span><span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>We can prove that to ourselves by passing that object to Python's built-in <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/built-in-functions-in-python/#type" target="_blank"><code>type</code></a> function:</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="nb">type</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">colors</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">&lt;class 'list'&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>Lists are ordered collections of things.</p>

      
        <p>We can create a new list by using <strong>square brackets</strong> (<code>[]</code>), and inside those square brackets, we put <strong>each of the items</strong> that we'd like our list to contain, <strong>separated by commas</strong>:</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">numbers</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">7</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">11</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">numbers</span>
<span class="go">[2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11]</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>Lists <strong>can contain any type of object</strong>.
Each item in a list doesn't need to be of the same type, but <em>in practice</em>, they typically are.</p>

      
        <p>So we might refer to this as a list of strings:</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">colors</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">"purple"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"green"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"blue"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"yellow"</span><span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>While this is a list of numbers:</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">numbers</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">7</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">11</span><span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre></div>

            Python is special. It's used by the big tech companies but also by those you would rarely classify as developers. On this episode, we get a look inside how Python is being used at a Children's Hospital to speed and improve patient care. We have Dr. Somak Roy here to share how he's using Python in his day to day job to help kids get well a little bit faster.

            In this episode, we worked on a trial banner that could persist across all pages on the site. Because the banner needed data that was only available on the index page, we had to refactor the banner into an inclusion template tag to make the tag work consistently.

            Last night, I was at an outdoor theatre with Serena, watching Anatomy of a Fall (an excellent film). Outdoor theatres are becoming rare, which is a pity, and Arena del Sole is lovely with its strong vintage, 80s vibe. There&rsquo;s little as pleasant as watching a film under the stars with your loved one on a quiet summer evening.
Anyway, in the pause, I glanced at my e-mails and discovered I had been again granted the Microsoft MVP Award.

            Summary: I&#8217;ve created a demo web app where you can search an aerial photo of Southampton, UK using text queries such as "roundabout", "tennis court" or "ship". It uses vector embeddings to do this &#8211; which I explain in this blog post. In this post I&#8217;m going to try and explain a bit more about [&#8230;]

            <p>Some time ago, I was looking for an idea for a small <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> project to help
me get some practical experience with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly">WebAssembly</a> (wasm). I wanted to do
something fun and whimsical and when I came across the Rust <a href="https://crates.io/crates/noise">noise crate</a> I knew
I was on to something.</p>
<p>After much learning, iteration and procrastination, I present to you <a href="https://menno.io/faux-maps/">Faux Maps</a>,
a generator of random, cutesy maps.</p>
<p><a href="https://menno.io/faux-maps/"><img src="/images/faux-maps.png" /></a></p>
<p>Through the magic of WebAssembly, all the work of generating each map is done
inside your browser. The web server hosting Faux Maps is not involved once the page
is loaded.</p>
<p>I can take little credit for the actual map generation algorthm - that's all
handled by the noise crate. I only selected some suitable generation parameters
and colours, and wrapped it up into a WebAssembly build. <a href="https://github.com/mjs/faux-maps">The project</a> is simple
enough to be a clean reference for how to put together a Rust based WebAssembly
project. I started with the excellent <a href="https://github.com/rustwasm/rust-webpack-template">rust-webpack-template</a> repo and
simplified all aspects as much as possible.</p>
<p>I'd love to add some dynamic features to the maps such as drifting clouds and
flocks of birds. These could be done as separate layers which sit above the
base map image. Maybe some rainy afternoon...</p>
