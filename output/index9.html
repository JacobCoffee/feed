            <p>So this blog is now celebrating its 21st birthday (or 20 if you count
from zero, or 18 if you want to be pedantic), and I figured I would do
this yearly thing of reviewing how that went.</p>

<h1 id="number-of-posts">Number of posts</h1>

<p>2022 was the <a href="https://anarc.at/blog/2023-01-07-bring-back-blogging/">official 20th
anniversary</a> in any case, and
that was one of my best years on record, with 46 posts, surpassed only
by the noisy 2005 (62) and matching 2006 (46). 2023, in comparison,
was underwhelming: a feeble 11 posts! What happened!</p>

<p>Well, I was busy with other things, mostly away from keyboard, that I
will not bore you with here...</p>

<p>The other thing that happened is that the one-liner I used to collect
stats was broken (it counted folders and other unrelated files) and
wildly overestimated 2022! Turns out I didn't write <em>that</em> much then:</p>

<pre><code>anarc.at$ ls blog | grep '^[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9].*.md' | se
d s/-.*// | sort | uniq -c  | sort -n -k2
     57 2005
     43 2006
     20 2007
     20 2008
      7 2009
     13 2010
     16 2011
     11 2012
     13 2013
      5 2014
     13 2015
     18 2016
     29 2017
     27 2018
     17 2019
     18 2020
     14 2021
     28 2022
     10 2023
      1 2024
</code></pre>

<p>But even that is inaccurate because, in ikiwiki, I can tag any page as
being featured on the blog. So we actually need to process the HTML
itself because we don't have much better on hand without going through
ikiwiki's internals:</p>

<pre><code>anarcat@angela:anarc.at$ curl -sSL https://anarc.at/blog/ | grep 'href="\./' | grep -o 20[0-9][0-9] | sort | uniq -c 
     56 2005
     42 2006
     19 2007
     18 2008
      6 2009
     12 2010
     15 2011
     10 2012
     11 2013
      3 2014
     15 2015
     32 2016
     50 2017
     37 2018
     19 2019
     19 2020
     15 2021
     28 2022
     13 2023
</code></pre>

<p>Which puts the top 10 years at:</p>

<pre><code>$ curl -sSL https://anarc.at/blog/ | grep 'href="\./' | grep -o 20[0-9][0-9] | sort | uniq -c  | sort -nr | head -10
     56 2005
     50 2017
     42 2006
     37 2018
     32 2016
     28 2022
     19 2020
     19 2019
     19 2007
     18 2008
</code></pre>

<p>Anyway. 2023 is certainly not a glorious year in that regard, in any case.</p>

<h1 id="visitors">Visitors</h1>

<p>In terms of visits, however, we had quite a few hits. According to
<a href="https://github.com/arp242/goatcounter">Goatcounter</a>, I had 122 300 visits in 2023! 2022, in comparison,
had 89 363, so that's quite a rise.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-read">What you read</h2>

<p>I seem to have hit the Hacker News front page at least twice. I say
"seem" because it's actually pretty hard to tell <em>what</em> the HN
frontpage actually is on any given day. I had 22k visits on
2023-03-13, in any case, and you <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/front?day=2023-03-13">can't see me on the front that
day</a>. We do see a post of mine <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/front?day=2023-09-02">on 2023-09-02</a>, all the way down
there, which seem to have generated another 10k visits.</p>

<p>In any case, here were the most popular stories for you fine visitors:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://anarc.at/hardware/laptop/framework-12th-gen/">Framework 12th gen laptop
review</a>: 24k visits, which is
surprising for a 13k words article "without images", as some
critics have complained. 15k referred by Hacker News. Good
reference and time-consuming benchmarks, slowly bit-rotting.</p>

<p>That is, by far, my most popular article ever. A popular article in
2021 or 2022 was around 6k to 9k, so that's a big one. I suspect it
will keep getting traffic for a long while.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://anarc.at/software/desktop/calibre/">Calibre replacement considerations</a>:
15k visits, most of which without a referrer. Was actually an old
article, but I suspect HN brought it back to light. I keep updating
that wiki page regularly when I find new things, but I'm still
using Calibre to import ebooks.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://anarc.at/hardware/tablet/kobo-clara-hd/">Hacking my Kobo Clara HD</a>: is not
new but always gathering more and more hits, it had 1800 hits in
the first year, 4600 hits last year and now brought 6400 visitors
to the blog! Not directly related, but <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Kobo+Glo+HD+eReader+Battery+Replacement/143903">this iFixit
battery replacement guide I wrote</a> also seem to be quite popular</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Everything else was published before 2023. <a href="https://anarc.at/blog/2020-06-04-replacing-smokeping-prometheus">Replacing Smokeping with
Prometheus</a> is still around and <a href="https://anarc.at/software/desktop/wayland/">Looking at Wayland terminal
emulators</a> makes an entry in the top five.</p>

<h2 id="where-youve-been">Where you've been</h2>

<p>People send less and less private information when they browse the
web. The number of visitors without referrers was 41% in 2021, it rose
to 44% in 2023. Most of the remaining traffic comes from Google, but
Hacker News is now a significant chunk, almost as big as Google.</p>

<p>In 2021, Google represented 23% of my traffic, in 2022, it was down to
15% so 18% is actually a rise from last year, even if it seems much
smaller than what I usually think of.</p>

<table class="table">
<thead>
<tr>
<th> Ratio </th>
<th> Referrer              </th>
<th> Visits </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td> 18%   </td>
<td> Google                </td>

<td> 918    </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>Note that Facebook and Twitter do not appear at all in my referrers.</p>

<h2 id="where-you-are">Where you are</h2>

<p>Unsurprisingly, most visits still come from the US:</p>

<table class="table">
<thead>
<tr>
<th> Ratio </th>
<th> Country        </th>
<th> Visits </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td> 26%   </td>
<td> United States  </td>
<td> 32 010 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 14%   </td>
<td> France         </td>
<td> 17 046 </td>

<tr>
<td> 10%   </td>
<td> Germany        </td>
<td> 11 650 </td>

<tr>
<td> 6%    </td>

<td> 7 425  </td>

<tr>
<td> 5%    </td>

<td> 6 473  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 3%    </td>
<td> Netherlands    </td>
<td> 3 436  </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>Those ratios are nearly identical to last year, but quite different
from 2021, where Germany and France were more or less reversed.</p>

<p>Back in 2021, I mentioned there was a long tail of countries with at
least one visit, with 160 countries listed. I expanded that and
there's now 182 countries in that list, almost all of the 193 member
states in the UN.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-were">What you were</h2>

<p>Chrome's dominance continues to expand, even on readers of this blog,
gaining two percentage points from Firefox compared to 2021.</p>

<table class="table">
<thead>
<tr>
<th> Ratio </th>
<th> Browser </th>
<th> Visits </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td> 49%   </td>
<td> Firefox </td>
<td> 60 126 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 36%   </td>
<td> Chrome  </td>
<td> 44 052 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 14%   </td>
<td> Safari  </td>
<td> 17 463 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 1%    </td>
<td> Others  </td>
<td> N/A    </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>It seems like, unfortunately, my Lynx and Haiku users have not visited
in the past year. It seems like trying to read those metrics is like
figuring out tea leaves...</p>

<p>In terms of operating systems:</p>

<table class="table">
<thead>
<tr>
<th> Ratio </th>
<th> OS      </th>
<th> Visits </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td> 28%   </td>
<td> Linux   </td>
<td> 34 010 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 23%   </td>
<td> macOS   </td>
<td> 28 728 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 21%   </td>
<td> Windows </td>
<td> 26 303 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 17%   </td>
<td> Android </td>
<td> 20 614 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 10%   </td>
<td> iOS     </td>
<td> 11 741 </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>Again, Linux and Mac are over-represented, and Android and iOS are
under-represented.</p>

<h1 id="what-is-next">What is next</h1>

<p>I hope to write more next year. I've been thinking about a few posts I
could write for work, about how things work behind the scenes at Tor,
that could be informative for many people. We run a rather old setup,
but things hold up pretty well for what we throw at it, and it's worth
sharing that with the world...</p>

<p>So anyway, thanks for coming, faithful reader, and see you in the
coming 2024 year...</p>

How can I make sure, automatically, that all the links to other internal pages within the site continue to work? In this article, I&rsquo;ll show you how I managed to do that using Scrapy, a web scraping tool, and GitHub Actions, the project&rsquo;s Continuous Integration system.
To solve this problem, I decided to use a web scraper.

            <p>For the longest time, I've wanted to re-implement the original DOOM engine in Python, and compile it with Shedskin to get reasonable performance. So when I finally ran across a pretty <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp9IE5bph-E">small engine written in Java</a>, by Leonardo Ono, I decided to convert his version to Python.

<p>I left out some optimizations (most notably "visplanes"), for readability and in order to keep everything under 1000 lines of code (while following PEP8). So it could run quite a bit faster still. This is including a WAD loader and interactive Pygame wrapper, that makes it almost feel like you are playing DOOM.

<p>It's interesting how using Python (using just CPython) seems to be about as fast as using assembler back in the day.</p>
  
<p>This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=171AQx7l43s">video<a></a> shows the day-and-night difference in FPS after compilation using Shedskin.

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/shedskin/shedskin/tree/master/examples/doom">source code</a> can be found in the Shedskin examples directory.

<p>I may revisit the code now and then, to try and improve readability by adding comments and/or refactoring parts. Patches in this direction very much welcome of course.
    
<p>In general, we are also always looking to receive more feedback and contributions from the community! While not the 'final' solution to Python performance, Shed Skin is great fun to hack on. See some potential <a href="https://github.com/shedskin/shedskin/issues">issues</a> for the next release to start looking into.

            You are rendering content with Python and want to show some Markdown, but you style your pages with Tailwind. With Tailwind&rsquo;s built-in reset, how can you style the tags of your rendered HTML that come from Markdown? This article shows how that can be done.
Specifically, I am assuming that you are working with Python&rsquo;s Markdown package.
I recently worked on a project where I needed to render some Markdown descriptions.

            <p>I recently decided to sit down and finally port <a href="http://github.com/shedskin/shedskin">Shed Skin</a>, an experimental restricted-Python-to-C++ compiler in the works since 2005 or so, to Python3. Three painful months and a total diff of 50k lines later, everything now works with Python3 (Shed Skin itself, and all tests and examples..)
  
<p>This does not mean that every Python3 feature is supported, but what was there now at least works fine with Python3.. For example, unicode is still restricted to 1-byte characters, and there is no support (yet) for nice new features such as f-strings. Python2 support has been dropped with the new release, and subsequent releases should add support for various new Python3 features. 

<p>The following people have contributed along the way:
  
<ul>
  <li>Johan Kristensen (large patch for moving from compiler.ast to ast, still on Python2)</li>
  <li>Shakeeb Alireza (extension module support for Python3, ported many examples, improved OSX support, and various code cleanups)</li>
  <li>Folkert van Heusden (some fixes on the C++ side, move to c++17)</li>
  <li>Jeremie Roquet, Thomas Spura, Paul Boddie and others who kept doing maintenance on the project in my absence</li>
</ul>

<p>I started work on the port after realizing that Shed Skin was being removed from distributions, especially Debian, as it was still tied to Python2, and I really want to keep Shed Skin in a working state if possible.
  
<p>So what about the future of the project? Not really sure, but I'm happy to sit down again in a few months to prepare a new release. Any <a href="https://github.com/shedskin/shedskin/issues/296">feedback</a> on what to support or improve would be very welcome!
  
<p>For fun, here are screenshots of some of the Shed Skin example programs (in total 75 working example programs can be found on the github site):
