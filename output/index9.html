            I liked pySimpleGUI, because as a coder that likes <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/tk.html">tkinter</a> (the Tk/Tcl bindings) and as a former tcl/tk coder I enoyed the syntaxic sugar that was avoiding all the boiler plates required to build the application.<br /><br />

The main advantage was about not having to remember in wich order to make the <i>pack</i> and having to do the <i>mainloop</i> call. It was not a revolution, just a simple, elegant evolution, hence I was still feeling in control.<br /><br />

However, the projet made a jerk move by relicensing in full proprietary license that requires a key to work functionnaly.<br /><br />
I will not discuss this since the point have been made clearly on <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/pysimplegui-now-requires-a-paid-license-opinions/48790/7">python mailing list</a>.<br /><br />

Luckily I want to raise 2 points : 
<ul>
  <li>we have been numerous coders to fork the project for doing pull requests</li>
  <li>it higlights once more the danger of too much dependencies</li>
</ul>
<br />
<br />
<h1>If you have a working copy of the repository</h1>
<br /><br />
Well, you can still install a past version of pysimpleGUI, but unless you can do
<pre>
pip install  git+https://github.com/jul/PySimpleGUI#egg=pysimpleGUI
</pre>
<br />
<br /><b>Pro:</b> if that version suited you, your old code will work
<br />
<b>Con:</b> there will be no update for the bugs and it is pretty much a no-go.<br />
<br />
<h1>Expect free alternative</h1>
<br /><br />

One of the power of free software is the power to fork, and some coders already forked in a « free forever » version of pysimpleGUI.<br />
One of this fork is : <a href="https://github.com/spyoungtech/FreeSimpleGUI">Free Simple GUI</a>.
<br /><br />
<b>Pro:</b> migration is as simple as :
<pre>

pip install FreeSimpleGUI
</pre>
and then in the source :
<pre>
- import PySimpleGUI as sg
+ import FreeSimpleGUI as sg
</pre>
<br />
<b>Con:</b> a project is as useful as the capacity of the community to keep up with the job of solving issues and the strength of the community to follow up.
<br /><br />
<h1>Migrating to tkinter</h1>
<br />
<br />
This will be covered in the week to come by translating some examples to real life migration by myself.<br /><br />
Since tkinter has improved a lot and his a pillar of python distribution when it is not broken by debian, it is fairly easy.
<br /><br />
<b>Pro:</b> diminises the need for a dependency and empower you with the poweful concept of tk such as variables binded to a widget (an observer pattern).
<br />
<b>Con:</b> PySimpleGUI is a multi-target adaptor to not only tkinter but also <i>remi (web)</i>, <i>wx</i>, <i>Qt</i>. If you were using the versatility of pysimpleGUI and its multi-platform features you really need to look at the « free forever » alternatives.

            <p><em>subtext: in my opinion, and for companies (and their users) that want a
good balance between protecting their core business with Open Source
ideals.</em></p>
<p>Following up to my thoughts on the <a class="reference external" href="http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2024/9/19/open-source-tax/">case for funding Open Source</a>, there is a second topic I want to
discuss in more detail: Open Source and commercialization.  As our
founder likes to say: <a class="reference external" href="https://cra.mr/open-source-is-not-a-business-model/">Open Source is not a business model</a>.  And indeed it
really isn't.  However, this does not mean that Open Source and Open
Source licenses aren't a critical consideration for a technology company
and a fascinating interconnection between the business model and license
texts.</p>
<p>As some of you might know I'm a strong proponent of the concept now
branded as “<a class="reference external" href="https://fair.io/about/">Fair Source</a>” which we support at
Sentry.  Fair Source is defined by a family of springing licenses that
give you the right to read and modify code, while also providing an
exclusivity period for the original creator to protect their core
business.  After a designated time frame, the code transitions into Open
Source via a process called DOSP: <a class="reference external" href="https://opensource.org/delayed-open-source-publication">Delayed Open Source Publication</a>.  This is not
an entirely new idea, and I have been writing about it a few times before
<a class="footnote-reference" href="http://lucumr.pocoo.org/feed.atom#footnote-1" id="footnote-reference-1">[1]</a> <a class="footnote-reference" href="http://lucumr.pocoo.org/feed.atom#footnote-2" id="footnote-reference-2">[2]</a>.</p>
<p>A recurring conversation I have in this context is the AGPL (Affero
General Public License) as an alternative vehicle for balancing business
goals and Open Source ideals.  This topic also has resurfaced recently
because of Elasticsearch'es <a class="reference external" href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/elasticsearch-is-open-source-again">Open Source, Again</a> post
where they announced that they will license Elasticsearch under the AGPL.</p>
<p>In my view, while AGPL is a true Open Source license, it is an inferior
choice compared to the <a class="reference external" href="https://fsl.software/">FSL</a> (the Functional
Source License, a Fair Source license) for many projects.  Let me explain
my reasoning.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-single-vendor-model">
<h2>The Single Vendor Model</h2>
<p>When you take a project like Sentry, which started as an Open Source
project and later turned into a VC funded company, its model revolves
around a commercial entity being in charge.  That model is often referred
to as “single vendor.”  This is also the case with companies like
Clickhouse Inc. or Elastic and their respective projects.</p>
<p>Sentry today is no longer Open Source, it's Fair Source (FSL licensed).
Elastic on the other hand is indeed unquestionable Open Source (AGPL among
others).  What both projects have in common is that they value brand
(including trademarks), that they have strong opinions on how that project
should be run, and they use a <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement">CLA</a> to give
themselves the right to re-licenses it under other terms.</p>
<p>In a &quot;single vendor&quot; setup, the company behind the project holds
significant power (<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_copyright_terms_of_countries">for ~150 years</a>
give or take).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-illusion-of-equality">
<h2>The Illusion of Equality</h2>
<p>When you look at the AGPL as a license it's easy to imagine that everybody
is equal.  Every contributor to a project agrees with the underlying
license assumptions of the AGPL and acts accordingly.  However, in
practice, things are more complicated — especially when it comes to
commercial usage.  Many legal departments are wary of the AGPL and the
broader GPL family of licenses.  Some challenges are also inherent to the
licenses such as not being able to <a class="reference external" href="https://www.fsf.org/blogs/licensing/more-about-the-app-store-gpl-enforcement">publish *GPL code to the app store</a>.</p>
<p>You can see this also with Elasticsearch.  The code is not just AGPL
licensed, you can also retrieve it under the ELv2 and SSPL licensing
terms.  Something that Elastic can do due to the CLAs in place.</p>
<p>Compare this to Linux, which is licensed under GPLv2 with a syscall
exception.  This very specific license was chosen by Linus Torvalds to
ensure the project's continued success while keeping it truly open.  In
Linux' case, no single entity has more rights than anyone else.  There is
not even a realistic option to relicense to a newer version of the GPL.</p>
<p>The FSL explicitly recognizes the reality that the single vendor holds
significant power but balances it by ensuring that this power diminishes
over time.  This idea can also be found in copyright law, where a
creator's work eventually enters the public domain.  A key difference with
software though is that it continuously evolves, making it hard to
pinpoint when it might eventually become public domain as thousands of
people contribute to it.</p>
<p>The FSL is much more aggressive in that aspect.  If we run Sentry into the
ground and the business fails, within two years, anyone can pick up the
pieces and revive it like a Phoenix from the ashes.  This isn't just
hypothetical.  Bryan Cantrill recently mentioned the desire of <a class="reference external" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41258843">Oxide
forking CockroachDB</a>
once its BUSL change date kicks in.  While that day hasn't come yet, it's
a real possibility.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="dying-companies">
<h2>Dying Companies</h2>
<p>Let's face it: companies fail.  I have no intentions for Sentry to be one
of them, but you never know.  Companies also don't just die just once,
they can do so repeatedly.  <a class="reference external" href="https://xapian.org/">Xapian</a> is an example
I like to quote here.  It started out as a GPL v2+ licensed search project
called Muscat which was built at Cambridge.  After several commercial
acquisitions and transitions, the project eventually became closed source
(which was possible because the creators held the copyright).  Some of the
original creators together with the community forked the last GPLv2
version into a project that eventually <a class="reference external" href="https://xapian.org/history">became known as Xapian</a>.</p>
<p>What's the catch?  The catch is that the only people who could license it
more liberally than GPLv2 are long gone from the project.  Xapian
refers to its current license “<a class="reference external" href="https://trac.xapian.org/wiki/Licensing">a historical accident</a>”.  The license choice causes
some challenges specifically to how Xapian is embedded.  There are three
remaining entities that would need to agree to the relicensing.  From my
understanding none of those entities commercially use Xapian's original
code today but also have no interest in actually supporting a potential
relicensing.</p>
<p>Unlike trademark law which has <a class="reference external" href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/1127">a concept of abandonment</a>, the copyright
situation is stricter.  It would take two lifetimes for Xapian to enter the
public domain and at that point it will be probably be mostly for archival
purposes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="equal-grounds-now-or-later">
<h2>Equal Grounds Now or Later</h2>
<p>If Xapian's original code would have been FSL licensed, it would have been
Apache 2.0 (or MIT with the alternative model) many times over.  You don't
need to hope that the original license holder still cares, by the time you
get hold of the source code, you already have an irrevocable promise that
it will eventually turn into Apache 2.0 (or MIT with the alternative license
choice) which is about as non-strings attached as it can get.</p>
<p>So in some ways a comparison is “AGPL now and forever” vs “FSL now, Apache
2.0/MIT in two years”.</p>
<p>That's not to say that AGPL (or SSPL) don't have their merits.  Xapian as
much as it might suffer from their accidental license choice also <em>is</em> a
successful Open Source project that helped a lot of developers out there.
Maybe the license did in fact work out well for them, and because
everybody is in the same boat it also has created a community of equals.</p>
<p>I do believe however it's important to recognize that “single-vendor AGPL
with a CLA” is absolutely not the same as “community driven AGPL project
without the CLA”.</p>
<p>The title claims that FSL balances Open Source better than AGPL, and it's
fair to question how a license that isn't Open Source can achieve that.
The key lies in understanding that Fair Source is built on the concept of
<em>delayed</em> Open Source.  Yes, there's a waiting period, but it’s a
relatively short one: just two years.  Count to two and the code
transitions to full, unshackled openness.  And that transition to Open
Source is a promise that can't be taken from you.</p>

  <p>Software security has historically been treated as extra or "nice-to-have",
  not a core feature that users expect. This means we have accumulated
  plenty of tech debt. Now there are growing incentives and requirements
  for producing secure software to meet user expectations.</p>
  
  <p>Luckily for us, many of the tools, data, and systems already exist to
  help us <strong>build a culture of security for Python</strong>. These tools help relay messages
  between software creators and users so we can collaborate on this shared goal.</p>
  
  <p>By actively participating you are starting the positive feedback loop of software security, making users safer faster!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Below is a list of items that actions can implement to build a culture of security for Python:</p>

<h4>Maintainers</h4>

<ul>
<li>Adopt <a href="https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/using-a-publisher/">Trusted Publishers</a> if you use GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, Google Cloud Build, or ActiveState to publish Python packages.</li>
<li>Use lock files for the build and publish workflow, such as pip-tools, Poetry, or PDM.</li>
<li>Adopt a lightweight security policy. Do not stress about CVEs: fix, release, publish a CVE.</li>
<li>Contribute new insecure code detections to <a href="https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Bandit</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Users</h4>

<ul>
<li>Update dependencies that have vulnerabilities. Prioritize projects that are connected to the internet.</li>
<li>Update software on a semi-regular basis to avoid out-of-date and end-of-life software. Staying up-to-date helps you being able to upgrade to fixed versions in the future.</li>
<li>Run tests with <code>PYTHONWARNINGS</code> with <code>DeprecationWarning</code> and <code>PendingDeprecationWarning</code> set to errors to avoid missing deprecated features.</li>
<li>Create a secure open source usage policy, using verified data to evaluate open source projects. Do not install new projects without checking your policy first.</li>
<li>If you need a Software Bill-of-Materials document there are tools available to generate one. Those tools will improve over time from new Python package SBOM standards.</li>
<li>Add a vulnerability scanner like pip-audit, Grype, or Trivy.</li>
</ul>

    <h2>Prompting for user input</h2>
    
      
        <p>Python has a built-in <code>input</code> function that we can use to <strong>prompt a user of our program to enter some text</strong>:</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">color</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">input</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"Favorite color:"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">Favorite color:&#9647;</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>Our Python <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/terms/#REPL" target="_blank">REPL</a> is now hanging and waiting for us (the user) to input text.
Let's type <code>purple</code>:</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">color</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">input</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"Favorite color:"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">Favorite color:purple&#9647;</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>After the user has typed the text they'd like to enter, they can hit the Enter key to <strong>lock-in the value</strong>.</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">color</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">input</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"Favorite color:"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">Favorite color:purple</span>
<span class="go">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>Now the <code>color</code> variable contains the string <code>purple</code>:</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">color</span>
<span class="go">'purple'</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>When working with data in Python, using Pandas to read JSON from URL is an excellent tool that lets you directly load JSON data from a web source into a Pandas dataframe. This tutorial will teach you the steps to accomplish this task, building upon our previous discussions on reading JSON with Python more generally. [&#8230;]</p>

<h2><img src="https://wingware.com/images/wing18.png" /> What's New in Wing 10</h2>
<br /><img alt="Wing 10 Screen Shot" class="doc-image" src="https://wingware.com/images/screenshots/wing10-screenshot.png" /><br /><div class="section">
<h3 class="title-3">AI Assisted Development</h3>
<p>Wing Pro 10 takes advantage of recent advances in the capabilities of generative AI to
provide powerful AI assisted development, including AI code suggestion, AI driven code
refactoring, description-driven development, and AI chat. You can ask Wing to use AI to
(1) implement missing code at the current input position, (2) refactor, enhance, or extend
existing code by describing the changes that you want to make, (3) write new code from a
description of its functionality and design, or (4) chat in order to work through
understanding and making changes to code.</p>
<p>Examples of requests you can make include:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&quot;Add a docstring to this method&quot;
&quot;Create unit tests for class SearchEngine&quot;
&quot;Add a phone number field to the Person class&quot;
&quot;Clean up this code&quot;
&quot;Convert this into a Python generator&quot;
&quot;Create an RPC server that exposes all the public methods in class BuildingManager&quot;
&quot;Change this method to wait asynchronously for data and return the result with a callback&quot;
&quot;Rewrite this threaded code to instead run asynchronously&quot;
</pre>
<p>Yes, really!</p>
<p>Your role changes to one of directing an intelligent assistant capable of completing a
wide range of programming tasks in relatively short periods of time. Instead of typing out
code by hand every step of the way, you are essentially directing someone else to work
through the details of manageable steps in the software development process.</p>

<h3 class="title-3">Support for Python 3.12, 3.13, and ARM64 Linux</h3>
<p>Wing 10 adds support for Python 3.12 and 3.13, including (1) faster debugging with PEP 669 low
impact monitoring API, (2) PEP 695 parameterized classes, functions and methods, (3) PEP 695 type
statements, and (4) PEP 701 style f-strings.</p>
<p>Wing 10 also adds support for running Wing on ARM64 Linux systems.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h3 class="title-3">Poetry Package Management</h3>
<p>Wing Pro 10 adds support for Poetry package management in the New Project dialog and the
<tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Packages</span></tt> tool in the <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Tools</span></tt> menu.  Poetry is an easy-to-use cross-platform dependency
and package manager for Python, similar to <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">pipenv</span></tt>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h3 class="title-3">Ruff Code Warnings &amp; Reformatting</h3>
<p>Wing Pro 10 adds support for Ruff as an external code checker in the <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Code</span> <span class="pre">Warnings</span></tt>
tool, accessed from the <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Tools</span></tt> menu. Ruff can also be used as a code reformatter
in the <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Source</span> <span class="pre">&gt;</span> <span class="pre">Reformatting</span></tt> menu group.  Ruff is an incredibly fast Python code
checker that can replace or supplement flake8, pylint, pep8, and mypy.</p>

            In this episode, we continued on the cloud migration path. We need to build a Docker container with all the necessary static files. Some of these come from Go via Hugo for a content blog. Some comes from JavaScript via Tailwind for CSS. Some come from Python via Sphinx for documentation. All need to built into the same image. That&rsquo;s what we covered on this stream.

        <div class="p-4 flex-grow overflow-hidden">
          <p class="text-base-content">
            <p>Both last week at London tech leaders and this week at the Open Source
Summit in Vienna I engaged in various discussions about pledging
money to Open Source.  At Sentry we have been <a class="reference external" href="https://blog.sentry.io/we-just-gave-500-000-dollars-to-open-source-maintainers/">funding our Open Source
dependencies</a>
for a few years now and we're trying to encourage others to do the same.</p>
<p>It’s not an easy ask, of course.  One quite memorable point raised
was what I would call “accidental spending”.  The story goes like this:
an engineering team spins up a bunch of Kubernetes machines.
As the fleet grows in scale some inefficiencies creep in.  To troubleshoot
or optimize, additional services such as load balancers, firewalls, cloud
provider log services, etc. are provisioned with minimal discussion.
Initially none of that was part of the plan, but ever so slightly for
every computing resource, some extra stuff is paid on top creating largely
hidden costs.  Ideally all of that pays off (after all, hopefully by
debugging quicker you reduce that downtime, by having that load balancer
you can auto scale and save on unused computing resources etc.).
But often, the payoff feels abstract and are hard to quantify.</p>
<p>I call those purchases “accidental” because they are proportional to the
deployed infrastructure and largely acting like a tax on top of
everything.  Only after a while does the scale of that line item become
apparent.  On the other hand intentionally purchasing a third party system
is a very intentional act.  It's very deliberate, requiring conversations
and more scrutiny is placed for putting a credit card into a new service.
Companies providing services understand this and are positioning
themselves accordingly.  Their play could be to make the case that that
their third party solution is better, cheaper etc.</p>
<p>Open Source funding could be seen through both of these lenses.  Today, in
many ways, pledging money to Open Source is a very intentional decision.  It
requires discussions, persuasion and justification.  The purpose and the
pay-off is not entirely clear.  Companies are not used to the idea of
funding Open Source and they don't have a strong model to reason about
these investments.  Likewise many Open Source projects themselves also
don't have a good way of dealing with money and might lack the governance
to handle funds effectively.  After all many of these projects are run by
individuals and not formal organizations.</p>
<p>Companies are unlikely to fund something without understanding the return
on investment.  One better understood idea is to turn that one “random
person in Nebraska” maintaining a critical dependency into a
well-organized team with good op-sec.  But for that to happen, funding
needs to scale from pennies to dollars, making it really worthwhile.</p>
<p>My colleague Chad Whitacre floated an idea: what if platforms like AWS or
GitHub started <a class="reference external" href="https://openpath.chadwhitacre.com/2024/a-vision-for-software-commons/">splitting the check</a>?
By adding a line-item to the invoices of their customers to support Open
Source finding.  It would turn giving to Open Source into more of a tax
like thing.  That might leverage the general willingness to just pile up
on things to do good things.  If we all pay 3% on top of our Cloud or SaaS
bills to give to Open Source this would quickly add up.</p>
<p>While I’m intrigued by the idea, I also have my doubts that this would
work.  It goes back to the problem mentioned earlier that some
Open Source projects just have no governance or are not even ready to
receive money.  How much value you put on a dependency is also very
individual.  Just because an NPM package has a lot of downloads does not
necessarily mean it's critical to the mission of the company.  <a class="reference external" href="https://www.rrweb.io/">rrweb</a> is a good example for us at Sentry.  It sits at
the core of our session replay product but since we we vendor a pinned
fork, you would not see rrweb in your dependency tree.  We also value that
package more than some algorithm would be able to determine about how
important that package is to us.</p>
<p>So the challenge with the tax — as appealing as it is — is that it might
make the “purchase decision” of funding Open Source easier, but it would
probably make the distribution problem much worse.  Deliberate,
intentional funding is key.  At least for the moment.</p>
<p>Still, it’s worth considering.  The “what if” is a powerful idea.  Using a
restaurant analogy, the “open-source tax” is like the mandatory VAT or
health surcharge on your bill: no choice is involved.  Another model could
be more like the tip suggestions on a receipt offering a choice but also
guidance on what’s appropriate to contribute.</p>
<p>The current model we propose with our upcoming <a class="reference external" href="https://osspledge.com/about/">Open Source Pledge</a> is to suggest like a tip what you
should give in relation to your developer work force.  Take the average
number of full time engineers you have over a year, multiply this by 2000.
That is the amount in US dollars you should give to your Open Source
dependencies.</p>
<p>That sounds like a significant amount!  But let's put this in relation for
a typical developer you employ: that's less than a fifth of what you would
pay for FICA (Federal Insurance Contributions Act in the US) in the US.
That's less than the communal tax you would pay in Austria.  I'm sure you
can think of similar payroll taxes in your country.</p>
<p>I believe that after step one of recognizing there is a funding problem
follows an obvious step two: having a baseline funding amount that stands
in relation to your business (you own or are a part of) of what the amount
should be.  Using the size of the development team as a metric offers an
objective and quantifiable starting point.  The beauty in my mind of the
developer count in particular is that it's somewhat independently
observable from both the outside and inside <a class="footnote-reference" href="http://lucumr.pocoo.org/feed.atom#footnote-1" id="footnote-reference-1">[1]</a>.  The latter is important!  It
creates a baseline for people within a company to start a conversation
about Open Source funding.</p>

<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_tax">Window Tax</a> was taxation
based on the number of Windows in a building.  That made enforcement
easy because you could count them from street level.  The downside of
taht was obviously the unintended consequences that this caused.
Something to always keep in mind!</td></tr>

    <h2>What do all the symbols mean in help output?</h2>
    
      
        <p>We'll cover what the <code>*</code> and <code>/</code> symbols below mean:</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">help</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">sorted</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">Help on built-in function sorted in module builtins:</span>

<span class="go">sorted(iterable, /, *, key=None, reverse=False)</span>
<span class="go">    Return a new list containing all items from the iterable in ascending order.</span>

<span class="go">    A custom key function can be supplied to customize the sort order, and the</span>
<span class="go">    reverse flag can be set to request the result in descending order.</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>We'll also talk about the different formats that help output comes in.
For example, note the square brackets in <code>[x]</code> below and note that there are two different styles noted for calling <code>int</code>:</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">help</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">int</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">Help on class int in module builtins:</span>

<span class="go">class int(object)</span>
<span class="go"> |  int([x]) -&gt; integer</span>
<span class="go"> |  int(x, base=10) -&gt; integer</span>
</code></pre></div>
