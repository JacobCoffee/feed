            English is now an API. Our apps read untrusted text; they follow instructions hidden in plain sight, and sometimes they turn that text into action. If you connect a model to tools or let it read documents from the wild, you have created a brand new attack surface. In this episode, we will make that concrete. We will talk about the attacks teams are seeing in 2025, the defenses that actually work, and how to test those defenses the same way we test code. Our guides are Tori Westerhoff and Roman Lutz from Microsoft. They help lead AI red teaming and build PyRIT, a Python framework the Microsoft AI Red Team uses to pressure test real products. By the end of this hour you will know where the biggest risks live, what you can ship this quarter to reduce them, and how PyRIT can turn security from a one time audit into an everyday engineering practice.

<p>&#8220;I think we will be there in three to six months, where AI is writing 90% of
the code. And then, in 12 months, we may be in a world where AI is writing
essentially all of the code&#8221;</p>
<p>— <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/anthropic-ceo-ai-90-percent-code-3-to-6-months-2025-3">Dario Amodei</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="/2025/6/4/changes/">Three months ago</a> I said that AI changes everything.  I
came to that after plenty of skepticism.  There are still good reasons to doubt
that AI will write all code, but my current reality is close.</p>
<p>For the infrastructure component I started at my new company, I&#8217;m probably
north of 90% AI-written code.  I don&#8217;t want to convince you — just share what I
learned.  In parts, because I approached this project differently from my first
experiments with AI-assisted coding.</p>
<p>The service is written in Go with few dependencies and an OpenAPI-compatible
REST API.  At its core, it sends and receives emails.  I also generated SDKs
for Python and TypeScript with a custom SDK generator.  In total: about 40,000
lines, including Go, YAML, Pulumi, and some custom SDK glue.</p>
<p>I set a high bar, especially that I can operate it reliably.  I&#8217;ve run similar
systems before and knew what I wanted.</p>
<h2>Setting it in Context</h2>
<p>Some startups are already near 100% AI-generated.  I know, because many build
in the open and you can see their code.  Whether that works long-term remains
to be seen.  I still treat every line as my responsibility, judged as if I
wrote it myself.  AI doesn&#8217;t change that.</p>
<p>There are no weird files that shouldn&#8217;t belong there, no duplicate
implementations, and no emojis all over the place.  The comments still follow
the style I want and, crucially, often aren&#8217;t there.  I pay close attention to
the fundamentals of system architecture, code layout, and database interaction.
I&#8217;m incredibly opinionated.  As a result, there are certain things I don&#8217;t let
the AI do.  I know it won&#8217;t reach the point where I could sign off on a commit.
That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s not 100%.</p>
<p>As contrast: another quick prototype we built is a mess of unclear database
tables, markdown file clutter in the repo, and boatloads of unwanted emojis.
It served its purpose — validate an idea — but wasn&#8217;t built to last, and we had
no expectation to that end.</p>
<h2>Foundation Building</h2>
<p>I began in the traditional way: system design, schema, architecture.  At this
state I don&#8217;t let the AI write, but I loop it in AI as a kind of rubber duck.
The back-and-forth helps me see mistakes, even if I don&#8217;t need or trust the
answers.</p>
<p>I did get the foundation wrong once.  I initially argued myself into a more
complex setup than I wanted.  That&#8217;s a part where I later used the LLM to redo
a larger part early and clean it up.</p>
<p>For AI-generated or AI-supported code, I now end up with a stack that looks
something like something I often wanted, but was too hard to do by hand:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Raw SQL:</strong> This is probably the biggest change to how I used to write
code.  I really like using an ORM, but I don&#8217;t like some of its effects.  In
particular, once you approach the ORM&#8217;s limits, you&#8217;re forced to switch to
handwritten SQL.  That mapping is often tedious because you lose some of the
powers the ORM gives you.  Another consequence is that it&#8217;s very hard to find
the underlying queries, which makes debugging harder.  Seeing the actual SQL
in your code and in the database log is powerful.  You always lose that with
an ORM.</p>
<p>The fact that I no longer have to write SQL because the AI does it for me is
a game changer.</p>
<p>I also use raw SQL for migrations now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>OpenAPI first:</strong> I tried various approaches here.  There are many
frameworks you can use.  I ended up first generating the OpenAPI specification
and then using code generation from there to the interface layer.  This
approach works better with AI-generated code.  The OpenAPI specification is
now the canonical one that both clients and server shim is based on.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Iteration</h2>
<p>Today I use Claude Code and Codex. Each has strengths, but the constant is
Codex for code review after PRs.  It&#8217;s very good at that.  Claude is
indispensable still when debugging and needing a lot of tool access (eg: why do
I have a deadlock, why is there corrupted data in the database etc.).  The
working together of the two is where it&#8217;s most magical.  Claude might find the
data, Codex might understand it better.</p>
<p>I cannot stress enough how bad the code from these agents can be if you&#8217;re not
careful.  While they understand system architecture and how to build something,
they can&#8217;t keep the whole picture in scope.  They will recreate things that
already exist.  They create abstractions that are completely inappropriate for
the scale of the problem.</p>
<p>You constantly need to learn how to bring the right information to the context.
For me, this means pointing the AI to existing implementations and giving it
very specific instructions on how to follow along.</p>
<p>I generally create PR-sized chunks that I can review.  There are two paths to
this:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Agent loop with finishing touches:</strong> Prompt until the result is close,
then clean up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lockstep loop:</strong> Earlier I went edit by edit. Now I lean on the first
method most of the time, keeping a todo list for cleanups before merge.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It requires intuition to know when each approach is more likely to lead to the
right results.  Familiarity with the agent also helps understanding when a task
will not go anywhere, avoiding wasted cycles.</p>
<h2>Where It Fails</h2>
<p>The most important piece of working with an agent is the same as regular
software engineering.  You need to understand your state machines, how the
system behaves at any point in time, your database.</p>
<p>It is easy to create systems that appear to behave correctly but have unclear
runtime behavior when relying on agents.  For instance, the AI doesn&#8217;t fully
comprehend threading or goroutines.  If you don&#8217;t keep the bad decisions at bay
early it, you won&#8217;t be able to operate it in a stable manner later.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example: I asked it to build a rate limiter.  It &#8220;worked&#8221; but lacked
jitter and used poor storage decisions.  Easy to fix if you know rate limiters,
dangerous if you don’t.</p>
<p>Agents also operate on conventional wisdom from the internet and in tern do
things I would never do myself.  It loves to use dependencies (particularly
outdated ones).  It loves to swallow errors and take away all tracebacks.
I&#8217;d rather uphold strong invariants and let code crash loudly when they fail,
than hide problems.  If you don&#8217;t fight this, you end up with opaque,
unobservable systems.</p>
<h2>Where It Shines</h2>
<p>For me, this has reached the point where I can&#8217;t imagine working any other way.
Yes, I could probably have done it without AI.  But I would have built a
different system in parts because I would have made different trade-offs.  This
way of working unlocks paths I&#8217;d normally skip or defer.</p>
<p>Here are some of the things I enjoyed a lot on this project:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Research + code, instead of research and code later:</strong> Some things that
would have taken me a day or two to figure out now take 10 to 15 minutes.<br />
It allows me to directly play with one or two implementations of a problem.
It moves me from abstract contemplation to hands on evaluation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Trying out things:</strong> I tried three different OpenAPI implementations and
approaches in a day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Constant refactoring:</strong> The code looks more organized than it would
otherwise have been because the cost of refactoring is quite low.  You need
to know what you do, but if set up well, refactoring becomes easy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Infrastructure:</strong> Claude got me through AWS and Pulumi.  Work I generally
dislike became a few days instead of weeks.  It also debugged the setup issues
as it was going through them.  I barely had to read the docs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Adopting new patterns:</strong> While they suck at writing tests, they turned out
great at setting up test infrastructure I didn&#8217;t know I needed.  I got a
recommendation on Twitter to use
<a href="https://golang.testcontainers.org/">testcontainers</a> for testing against
Postgres.  The approach runs migrations once and then creates database clones
per test.  That turns out to be super useful.  It would have been quite an
involved project to migrate to.  Claude did it in an hour for all tests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>SQL quality:</strong> It writes solid SQL I could never remember.  I just need to
review which I can.  But to this day I suck at remembering <code>MERGE</code> and <code>WITH</code>
when writing it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>What does it mean?</h2>
<p>Is 90% of code going to be written by AI?  I don&#8217;t know.  What I do know is,
that for me, on this project, the answer is already yes.  I&#8217;m part of that
growing subset of developers who are building real systems this way.</p>
<p>At the same time, for me, AI doesn&#8217;t own the code.  I still review every line,
shape the architecture, and carry the responsibility for how it runs in
production.  But the sheer volume of what I now let an agent generate would
have been unthinkable even six months ago.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m convinced this isn&#8217;t some far-off prediction.  It&#8217;s already here
— just unevenly distributed — and the number of developers working like this is
only going to grow.</p>
<p>That said, none of this removes the need to actually be a good engineer.  If you
let the AI take over without judgment, you&#8217;ll end up with brittle systems and
painful surprises (data loss, security holes, unscalable software).  The tools
are powerful, but they don&#8217;t absolve you of responsibility.</p>

            <h1>Foreword what is yahi?</h1>
<br /><br />
<a href="https://pypi.org/project/yahi/">Yahi</a> is a python module that can installed with pip to make a all in one static html page aggregating the data from a web server.

Actually, as <a href="https://yahi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/misusing.html">shown with the parsing of auth.log in the documentation</a>, it is pretty much a versatile log analyser based on regexp enabling various aggregation : by geo_ip, by histograms, chronological series.<br />
The demo is <a href="https://jul.github.io/cv/demo.html"> here</a>. It pretty much is close to awstats which is discontinued or <a href="https://goaccess.io"> goaccess</a>.
<br /><br />
As the author of yahi I may not be very objective, but I claim it is having a quality other tools don't have : it is easy to abuse for format other than web logs and here is an example out of the norm : parsing CSV.

<br /><br />

<p>There are simple cases when CSV don’t have strings embedded and are litteraly comma separated integers/floats.</p>
<p>In this case, CSV can be parsed as a regexp and it’s all the more convenient when the CSV has no title.</p>
<p>Here is an example using the CSV coming from the CSV generated by <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jul/trollometre/">trollometre</a></p>

<p>And here we can see that each counseler is following on average ~250 jobless persons.</p>
<img alt="" src="https://yahi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/csv_3.png" width="1080px" />
<p>And the frequency of the firstname</p>
<img alt="" src="https://yahi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/csv_4.png" width="1080px" />
<p>Which correlated with the demographic of the firstname as included here below tends to prove
that the older you are the less likeky you are to be jobless.</p>
<p>I am not saying <em>ageism</em>, the data are doing it for me.</p>

            <p>Reviewed by: Sumit Sarabhai and Gaurav Sharma If you’ve worked with databases in Python, you know the boilerplate: open a connection, create a cursor, run queries, commit or rollback transactions, close cursors and connection. Forgetting just one cleanup step can lead to resource leaks (open connections) or even inconsistent data. That’s where context managers step [&#8230;]</p>

            <p>Wing Python IDE version 11.0.5 has been released.  It fixes remote development with
older Python versions, improves Python code analysis when using Python 3.14 and
for type hints on instance attributes, and fixes Find Uses and Refactoring to
find all overrides of a method.</p>
<img alt="Wing 11 Screen Shot" class="eye-candy-image unfloat-at-900" src="https://wingware.com/images/screenshots/wing11-screenshot.png" width="650px" /><h3>Downloads</h3><div class="note">
Be sure to <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Check</span> <span class="pre">for</span> <span class="pre">Updates</span></tt> in Wing's <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Help</span></tt> menu after downloading, to make
sure that you have the latest hot fixes.</div>

<p>Wing 10 and earlier versions are not affected by installation of Wing 11 and
may be installed and used independently. However, project files for Wing 10
and earlier are converted when opened by Wing 11 and should be saved under a
new name, since Wing 11 projects cannot be opened by older versions of Wing.</p>
<h2><img src="https://wingware.com/images/wing18.png" /> New in Wing 11</h2><h3>Improved AI Assisted Development</h3><p>Wing 11 improves the user interface for AI assisted development by introducing two separate
tools <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span> <span class="pre">Coder</span></tt> and <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span> <span class="pre">Chat</span></tt>. <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span> <span class="pre">Coder</span></tt> can be used to write, redesign, or extend code
in the current editor. <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span> <span class="pre">Chat</span></tt> can be used to ask about code or iterate in creating a
design or new code without directly modifying the code in an editor.</p>
<p>Wing 11's AI assisted development features now support not just OpenAI but also Claude, Grok,
Gemini, Perplexity, Mistral, Deepseek, and any other OpenAI completions API compatible AI provider.</p>
<p>This release also improves setting up AI request context, so that both automatically and
manually selected and described context items may be paired with an AI request. AI request
contexts can now be stored, optionally so they are shared by all projects, and may be used
independently with different AI features.</p>
<p>AI requests can now also be stored in the current project or shared with all projects, and Wing
comes preconfigured with a set of commonly used requests. In addition to changing code in the
current editor, stored requests may create a new untitled file or run instead in AI Chat. Wing
11 also introduces options for changing code within an editor, including replacing code,
commenting out code, or starting a diff/merge session to either accept or reject changes.</p>
<p>Wing 11 also supports using AI to generate commit messages based on the changes being committed
to a revision control system.</p>
<p>You can now also configure multiple AI providers for easier access to different models.</p>
<p>For details see <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span> <span class="pre">Assisted</span> <span class="pre">Development</span></tt> under <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Wing</span> <span class="pre">Manual</span></tt> in Wing 11's <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Help</span></tt> menu.</p>
<h3>Package Management with uv </h3><p>Wing Pro 11 adds support for the <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">uv</span></tt> package manager in the New Project dialog and the
Packages tool.</p>
<p>For details see <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Project</span> <span class="pre">Manager</span> <span class="pre">&gt;</span> <span class="pre">Creating</span> <span class="pre">Projects</span> <span class="pre">&gt;</span> <span class="pre">Creating</span> <span class="pre">Python</span> <span class="pre">Environments</span></tt> and <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Package</span>

<h3>Improved Python Code Analysis</h3><p>Wing 11 makes substantial improvements to Python code analysis, with better support for
literals such as dicts and sets, parametrized type aliases, <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">typing.Self</span></tt>, type of
variables on the <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">def</span></tt> or <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">class</span></tt> line that declares them, generic classes with
<tt class="literal"><span class="pre">[...]</span></tt>, <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">__all__</span></tt> in <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">*.pyi</span></tt> files, subscripts in <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">typing.Type</span></tt> and similar, type
aliases, type hints in strings, <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">type[...]</span></tt> and <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">tuple[...]</span></tt>,
<tt class="literal"><span class="pre">&#64;functools.cached_property</span></tt>, base classes found also in <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">.pyi</span></tt> files, and
<tt class="literal"><span class="pre">typing.Literal[...]</span></tt>.</p>
<h3>Updated Localizations</h3><p>Wing 11 updates the German, French, and Russian localizations, and introduces a new experimental
AI-generated Spanish localization. The Spanish localization and the new AI-generated strings in the
French and Russian localizations may be accessed with the new <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">User</span> <span class="pre">Interface</span> <span class="pre">&gt;</span> <span class="pre">Include</span> <span class="pre">AI</span>
<span class="pre">Translated</span> <span class="pre">Strings</span></tt> preference.</p>
<h3>Improved diff/merge</h3><p>Wing Pro 11 adds floating buttons directly between the editors to make navigating differences
and merging easier, allows undoing previously merged changes, and does a better job managing
scratch buffers, scroll locking, and sizing of merged ranges.</p>
<p>For details see <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Difference</span> <span class="pre">and</span> <span class="pre">Merge</span></tt> under <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Wing</span> <span class="pre">Manual</span></tt> in Wing 11's <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Help</span></tt> menu.</p>
<h3>Other Minor Features and Improvements</h3><p>Wing 11 also adds support for Python 3.14, improves the custom key binding assignment user
interface, adds a <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Files</span> <span class="pre">&gt;</span> <span class="pre">Auto-Save</span> <span class="pre">Files</span> <span class="pre">When</span> <span class="pre">Wing</span> <span class="pre">Loses</span> <span class="pre">Focus</span></tt> preference, warns
immediately when opening a project with an invalid Python Executable configuration, allows
clearing recent menus, expands the set of available special environment variables for
project configuration, and makes a number of other bug fixes and usability improvements.</p>
<h3>Changes and Incompatibilities</h3><p>Since Wing 11 replaced the <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span></tt> tool with <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span> <span class="pre">Coder</span></tt> and <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span> <span class="pre">Chat</span></tt>, and AI
configuration is completely different than in Wing 10, you will need to reconfigure your
AI integration manually in Wing 11. This is done with <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Manage</span> <span class="pre">AI</span> <span class="pre">Providers</span></tt> in the
<tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span></tt> menu. After adding the first provider configuration, Wing will set that provider as
the default. You can switch between providers with <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Switch</span> <span class="pre">to</span> <span class="pre">Provider</span></tt> in the <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">AI</span></tt> menu.</p>

            A couple years ago, Charlie Marsh lit a fire under Python tooling with Ruff and then uv. Today he’s back with something on the other side of that coin: pyx.  Pyx isn’t a PyPI replacement. Think server, not just index. It mirrors PyPI, plays fine with pip or uv, and aims to make installs fast and predictable by letting a smart client talk to a smart server. When the client and server understand each other, you get new fast paths, fewer edge cases, and the kind of reliability teams beg for. If Python packaging has felt like friction, this conversation is traction. Let’s get into it.

            <p>I see new learners asking about &#8220;DSA&#8221; a lot.  Data Structures and Algorithms
are of course important: considered broadly, they are the two ingredients that
make up all programs.  But in my opinion, &#8220;DSA&#8221; as an abstract field of study
is over-emphasized.</p><p>I understand why people focus on DSA: it&#8217;s a concrete thing to learn about,
there are web sites devoted to testing you on it, and most importantly, because
job interviews often involve DSA coding questions.</p><p>Before I get to other opinions, let me make clear that anything you can do to
help you get a job is a good thing to do.  If grinding
<a href="https://leetcode.com/" rel="external noopener">leetcode</a> will land you a position, then do it.</p><p>But I hope companies hiring entry-level engineers aren&#8217;t asking them to
reverse linked lists or balance trees.  Asking about techniques that can be
memorized ahead of time won&#8217;t tell them anything about how well you can work.
The stated purpose of those interviews is to see how well you can figure out
solutions, in which case memorization will defeat the point.</p><p>The thing new learners don&#8217;t understand about DSA is that actual software
engineering almost never involves implementing the kinds of algorithms that
&#8220;DSA&#8221; teaches you.  Sure, it can be helpful to work through some of these
puzzles and see how they are solved, but writing real code just doesn&#8217;t involve
writing that kind of code.</p><p>Here is what I think in-the-trenches software engineers should know about
data structures and algorithms:</p><ul>

<li>Data structures are ways to organize data. Learn some of the basics: linked
list, array, hash table, tree.  By &#8220;learn&#8221; I mean understand what it does
and why you might want to use one.</li>

<li>Different data structures can be used to organize the same data in different
ways.  Learn some of the trade-offs between structures that are similar.</li>

<li>Algorithms are ways of manipulating data.  I don&#8217;t mean named algorithms
like Quicksort, but algorithms as any chunk of code that works on data and
does something with it.</li>

<li>How you organize data affects what algorithms you can use to work with the
data.  Some data structures will be slow for some operations where another
structure will be fast.</li>

<li>Algorithms have a &#8220;time complexity&#8221; (Big O): <a href="/text/bigo.html" rel="external noopener">how the code
slows as the data grows</a>.  Get a sense of what this means.</li>

<li>Python has a number of built-in data structures.  Learn how they work, and
the time complexity of their operations.</li>

<li>Learn how to think about your code to understand its time complexity.</li>

<li>Read a little about more esoteric things like <a href="https://systemdesign.one/bloom-filters-explained/" rel="external noopener">Bloom
filters</a>, so you can find them later in the unlikely case you need them.</li>

</ul><p>Here are some things you don&#8217;t need to learn:</p><ul>

<li>The details of a dozen different sorting algorithms.  Look at two to see
different ways of approaching the same problem, then move on.</li>

<li>The names of &#8220;important&#8221; algorithms.  Those have all been implemented for
you.</li>

<li>The answers to all N problems on some quiz web site.  You won&#8217;t be asked
these exact questions, and they won&#8217;t come up in your real work.  Again: try a
few to get a feel for how some algorithms work.  The exact answers are not what
you need.</li>

</ul><p>Of course some engineers need to implement hash tables, or sorting algorithms
or whatever.  We love those engineers: they write libraries we can use off the
shelf so we don&#8217;t have to implement them ourselves.</p><p>There have been times when I implemented something that felt like An
Algorithm (for example, <a href="https://nedbatchelder.com/blog/201707/finding_fuzzy_floats.html">Finding fuzzy floats</a>), but it was
more about considering another perspective on my data, looking at the time
complexity, and moving operations around to avoid quadratic behavior. It wasn&#8217;t
opening a textbook to find the famous algorithm that would solve my problem.</p><p>Again: if it will help you get a job, deep-study DSA. But don&#8217;t be
disappointed when you don&#8217;t use it on the job.</p><p>If you want to prepare yourself for a career, and also stand out in job
interviews, learn how to write tests:</p><ul>

<li>This will be a skill you use constantly. Real-world software means writing
tests much more than school teaches you to.</li>

<li>In a job search, testing experience will stand out more than DSA depth.  It
shows you&#8217;ve thought about what it takes to write high-quality software instead
of just academic exercises.</li>

<li>It&#8217;s not obvious how to test code well. It&#8217;s a puzzle and a problem to
solve.  If you like figuring out solutions to tricky questions, focus on how to
write code so that it can be tested, and how to test it.</li>

<li>Testing not only gives you more confidence in your code, it helps you write
better code in the first place.</li>

<li>Testing applies everywhere, from tiny bits of code to entire architectures,
assisting you in design and implementation at all scales.</li>

<li>If pursued diligently, testing is an engineering discipline in its own
right, with a fascinating array of tools and techniques.</li>

</ul><p>Less DSA, more testing.</p>

            Today on Talk Python: What really happens when your data work outgrows your laptop. Matthew Rocklin, creator of Dask and cofounder of Coiled, and Nat Tabris a staff software engineer at Coiled join me to unpack the messy truth of cloud-scale Python. During the episode we actually spin up a 1,000 core cluster from a notebook, twice! We also discuss picking between pandas and Polars, when GPUs help, and how to avoid surprise bills. Real lessons, real tradeoffs, shared by people who have built this stuff. Stick around.

    <h2>Nested list comprehensions</h2>
    
      
        <p>Here's a nested list comprehension:</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">scores_by_group</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[[</span><span class="mi">85</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">92</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">78</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">91</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">88</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">95</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">77</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">82</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">90</span><span class="p">]]</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">percentages</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[[</span><span class="n">score</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="mi">100</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">score</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">group_scores</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">group_scores</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">scores_by_group</span><span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>This is a list comprehension with <em>another</em> list comprehension inside its mapping part.</p>

      
        <p>List comprehensions create a new list, and since we've embedded a comprehension <em>within</em> a comprehension, this code creates <strong>a list-of-lists</strong>:</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">percentages</span>
<span class="go">[[0.85, 0.92, 0.78], [0.91, 0.88, 0.95], [0.77, 0.82, 0.9]]</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>I don't find this code very readable:</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">percentages</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[[</span><span class="n">score</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="mi">100</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">score</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">group_scores</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">group_scores</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">scores_by_group</span><span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>But I don't think the comprehensions are the problem here.
The problem is our use of whitespace.</p>

      
        <p>Here's the same code broken up over multiple lines:</p>

      
        <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">percentages</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span>
<span class="gp">... </span>    <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">score</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="mi">100</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">score</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">group_scores</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="gp">... </span>    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">group_scores</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">scores_by_group</span>
<span class="gp">... </span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">percentages</span>
<span class="go">[[0.85, 0.92, 0.78], [0.91, 0.88, 0.95], [0.77, 0.82, 0.9]]</span>
</code></pre></div>


      
        <p>I find this code much more readable.</p>

      
        <p>But is it more or <em>less</em> readable than an equivalent <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/writing-a-for-loop/" target="_blank"><code>for</code> loop</a> would be?</p>

      
    
  
    <h2>Nested <code>for</code> loops</h2>
    
      <p>Here's the same code without …</p>

            <p>The 2025 election for the PSF Board created an opportunity for conversations about the PSF's work to serve the global Python community. We appreciate community members' perspectives, passion, and engagement in the election process this year.&nbsp;</p><p>We want to send a big thanks to everyone who ran and was willing to serve on the PSF Board. Even if you were not elected, we appreciate all the time and effort you put into thinking about how to improve the PSF and represent the parts of the community you participate in. We hope that you will continue to think about these issues, share your ideas, and join a PSF Work Group or PSF initiative if you feel called to do so.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Board Members Elect</h2><p>Congratulations to our two new and two returning Board members who have been elected!&nbsp;<br /></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Abigail Dogbe</li><li>Jannis Leidel</li><li>Sheena O’Connell</li><li>Simon Willison</li></ul><p>We’ll be in touch with all the elected candidates shortly to schedule onboarding. Newly elected PSF Board members are provided orientation for their service and will be joining the upcoming board meeting.&nbsp;</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Thank you!</h2><p>We’d like to take this opportunity to thank our outgoing board members. Kushal Das has been serving on the PSF Board for over ten years– WOW! Kushal has been a part of change after change for the PSF and Python community, serving in PSF Board officer positions, and we are incredibly grateful for his contributions. Dawn Wages quickly became an integral part of the Board during her tenure, stepping up as Treasurer and then Board Chair. Dawn helped guide us through a period of major change– navigating a difficult economy, adapting to the rise of AI, and supporting important shifts in our programs. Thank you, Kushal and Dawn, for your leadership and dedication to the PSF and the Python community. You will be missed and are deeply appreciated!&nbsp;</p><p>Our heartfelt thanks go out to each of you who took the time to review the candidates and submit your votes. Your participation helps the PSF represent our community. We received 683 total ballots, easily reaching quorum–1/3 of affirmed voting members (929). We’re especially grateful for your patience with continuing to navigate the changes to the election processes and schedule, which allows for a valid election and a more sustainable election system.<br /><br />We also want to thank everyone who helped promote this year’s board election, especially Board Members Cristián Maureira-Fredes and Georgi Ker, who took the initiative to cover this year’s election and produced informational videos for our candidates. This promotional effort was inspired by the work of <a href="https://pythoncommunitynews.com/" target="_blank">Python Community News</a> in 2023. We also want to highlight the PSF staff members and PSF Board members who put in tons of effort each year as we work to continually improve the PSF elections.<br /></p><h2 style="text-align: left;">What’s next?</h2><p>If you’re interested in the complete tally, make sure to check the <a href="https://opavote.com/results/6226848987480064" target="_blank">Python Software Foundation Board of Directors Election 2025 Results page</a>. <i>These results will be available until Nov 11, 2025.</i></p><p>The PSF Election team will conduct a retrospective of this year’s election process to ensure we are improving year over year. We received valuable feedback about the process and tooling. We hope to be able to implement more changes for next year to ensure a smooth and accessible election process for everyone in our community.</p><p>Finally, it might feel a little early to mention this, but we will have at least 3 seats open again next year. If you're interested in running or learning more, we encourage you to contact a current PSF Board member or two this year and ask them about their experience serving on the board.<br /><br /></p>
