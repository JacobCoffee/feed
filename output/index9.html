            <p>Another day, another <a class="reference external" href="http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2016/3/24/open-source-trust-scaling/">rant</a>
<a class="reference external" href="http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2022/1/10/dependency-risk-and-funding/">about</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2024/3/26/rust-cdo/">dependencies</a>. from me.  This time I will ask you that we
start and support a vibe shift when it comes to dependencies.</p>
<p>You're probably familiar with the concept of “dependency churn.”  It's that
never-ending treadmill of updates, patches, audits, and transitive
dependencies that we as developers love to casually install in the name of
productivity.  Who doesn't enjoy waiting for yet another <cite>cargo upgrade</cite>
just so you can get that fix for a bug you don't even have?</p>
<p>It's a plague in most ecosystems with good packaging solutions.
JavaScript and Rust are particularly badly affected by that.  A brand new
Tokio project drags in 28 crates, a new Rocket project balloons that to
172, and a little template engine like MiniJinja can exist with just a
single dependency — while its CLI variant slurps up 142.</p>
<p>If that doesn't sound like a big deal, let's consider <a class="reference external" href="https://crates.io/crates/terminal_size">terminal_size</a>.  It is a crate that does
exactly what its name suggests: it figures out your terminal dimensions.
The underlying APIs it uses have effectively been stable since the earliest days of computing
terminals—what, 50 years or so? And yet, for one function, terminal-size
manages to introduce three or four additional crates, depending on your
operating system.  That triggers a whole chain reaction, so you end up
compiling thousands of other functions just to figure out if your terminal
is 80x25 or 120x40.  That crate had 26 releases.  My own version of that
that I have stuck away in a project from 10 years ago still works without
a single update.  Because shocker: nothing about figuring out terminal
sizes has changed.  <a class="footnote-reference" href="http://lucumr.pocoo.org/feed.atom#footnote-1" id="footnote-reference-1">[1]</a></p>
<p>So why does <cite>terminal-size</cite> have so many updates if it's so stable?
Because it's build on top of platform abstraction libraries that
constantly churn, so it needs to update to avoid code duplication and
blowing up compile times even more.</p>
<p>But “big supply chain” will tell you that you must do it this way.  Don't
you dare to copy paste that function into your library.  Or don't you date
to use “unsafe” yourself.  You're not qualified enough to write unsafe
code, let the platform abstraction architects do that.  Otherwise someone
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/geiger-rs/cargo-geiger">will slap you</a>.  There are
entire companies who are making a living of supplying you with the tools
needed to deal with your dependency mess.  In the name of security, we're
pushed to having dependencies and keeping them up to date, despite most of
those dependencies being the primary source of security problems.</p>
<p>The goal of code in many ways should be to be written in a way that it
does not need updates.  It should eventually achieve some level of
stability.  In the Rust ecosystem stable code is punished.  If you have a
perfectly working dependency but you have a somewhat inactive bug tracker,
RUSTSEC will come by and <a class="reference external" href="http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2024/3/26/rust-cdo/">give you a chunk rating</a>.</p>
<p>But there <em>is</em> a simpler path.  You write code yourself.  Sure, it's more
work up front, but once it's written, it's done. No new crates, no waiting
for upsteam authors to fix that edge case.  If it's broken for you, you
fix it yourself.  Code that works doesn't necessarily need the
maintenance treadmill.  Your code has a corner case?  Who cares.  This is
that vibe shift we need in the Rust world: celebrating fewer dependencies
rather than more.</p>
<p>We're at a point in the most ecosystems where pulling in libraries is not
just the default action, it's seen positively: “Look how modular and
composable my code is!”  Actually, it might just be a symptom of never
wanting to type out more than a few lines.</p>
<p>Now one will make the argument that it takes so much time to write all of
this.  It's 2025 and it's faster for me to have ChatGPT or Cursor whip up
a dependency free implementation of these common functions, than it is for
me to start figuring out a dependency.  And it makes sense as for many
such small functions the maintenance overhead is tiny and much lower than
actually dealing with constant upgrading of dependencies.  The code is just
a few lines and you also get the benefit of no longer need to compile
thousands of lines of other people's code for a single function.</p>
<p>But let's face it: corporate code review culture has also has infected
Open Source software.  Companies are more likely to reward engineers than
scold them for pulling in that new “shiny library” that solves the problem
they never actually had.  That creates problems, so dependabot and friends
were born.  Today I just dread getting dependabot pull requests but on
projects but I have to accept it.  I'm part of an ecosystem with my stuff
and that ecosystem is all about churn, churn, churn.  In companies you can
also keep entire internal engineering teams busy with vendoring
dependencies, internal audits and upgrading things throughout the company.</p>
<p>Fighting this fight is incredibly hard!  Every new hire has been trained
on the idea that dependencies are great, that code reuse is great.  That
having old code sitting around is a sign of bad engineering culture.</p>
<p>It's also hard to fight this in Open Source.  Years ago I wrote <a class="reference external" href="https://crates.io/crates/sha1_smol">sha1-smol</a> which originally was just called
<cite>sha1</cite>.  It became the standard crate to calculate SHA1 hashes.
Eventually I was pressured to donate that package name to rust-crypto and
to depend on the rest of the crypto ecosystem as it was so established.
If you want to use the new sha1 crate, you get to enjoy 10 dependencies.
But there was just no way around it, because that name in the registry is
precious and people also wanted to have trait compatibility.  It feels
tiring to be the only person in a conversation pushing to keep the churn
down and dependencies low.</p>
<p>It's time to have a new perspective: we should give kudos to engineers who
write a small function themselves instead of hooking in a transitive web
of crates.  We should be suspicious of big crate graphs.  Celebrated are
the minimal dependencies, the humble function that just quietly does the
job, the code that doesn't need to be touched for years because it was
done right once.</p>
<p>And sure, it's not black and white.  There are the important libraries
that solve hard problems.  Graphics libraries that abstract over complex
drivers, implementations of protocols like HTTP and QUIC.  I won't be able
to get rid of tokio and I have no desire to.  But when you end up using
one function, but you compile hundreds, some alarm bell should go off.</p>
<p>We need that vibe shift.  To celebrate building it yourself when it's
appropriate to do so.  To give credit to library authors who build low to
no-dependency Open Source libraries.</p>
<p>For instance minijinja celebrates it in the readme:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ cargo tree
minimal v0.1.0 (examples/minimal)
└── minijinja v2.6.0 (minijinja)
    └── serde v1.0.144
</pre>
<p>And it has a PR to eventually <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mitsuhiko/minijinja/pull/539">get rid of the last dependency</a>.  And sometime this
year I will make it my goal to go ahead proudly and trim down all that fat
in my projects.</p>

because Rust does not expose the platform's libc constants to you, and
they are not standarized.  That however is such a common and
lightweight dependency that you won't be able to avoid it anyways.</td></tr>

            Over the last year I’ve updated my Advanced Python course to be based on a series of modules that can more easily be adapted to the specific needs of any team or group of delegates. There’s a lot more advanced material and the exercises have also been updated. A good engineer’s Python in three days. https://agileabstractions.com/advanced/ Typically taught as a three day hands on course that will take you deeper into the Python programming language and ecosystem. This course will take delegates from beginner/intermediate level in Python to Advanced Python experts. The course provides a solid overview of the Python language including some low level details essential to working confidently and fluidly with Python. The focus is on practical programming and the skills learned here can be applied in any field where Python is used. This course is taught by Michael Foord. Michael has been teaching Python for over a decade and has over twenty years industry experience as an application developer. Michael is a Python core developer and the creator of unittest.mock in the Python standard library, and is the author of “The Absolute Minimum Every Python Web Application Developer Must Know About Security”. In this course delegates will learn a great deal of Python, from an essential foundation like how assignment works to taking advantage of multicore systems with multiprocessing. Included is networking, from API clients to understanding sockets and how servers work - the request response cycle of the REST API model, language features like closures, generators, context managers and the whole Python object model along with testing with pytest. For smart programmers this course provides a solid foundation for working with Python along with many advanced language features and concepts and powerful libraries for tackling many common programming scenarios.

            <p>Installing your Python application’s dependencies can be surprisingly slow.
Whether you’re running tests in CI, building a Docker image, or installing an application, downloading and installing dependencies can take a while.</p>

<p>So how do you speed up installation with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pip</code>?</p>

<p>In this article I’ll cover:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Avoiding the slow path of installing from source.</li>
  <li>The package cache.</li>
  <li>Bytecode compilation and how it interacts with installation and startup speed.</li>
  <li>Using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">uv</code>, a faster replacement for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pip</code>, and why it’s not always as fast as it might initially seem.</li>

<p>The decorator pattern is a functional pattern that Python developers leverage to write more modular and composable functions.
In this Pydon't, you will learn exactly why the decorator pattern matters, how to use it, and when to use it.
You will also learn how to implement your custom decorators and more advanced use cases of decorators.</p>
<p>In this Pydon't, you will:</p>
<ul><li>learn to recognise when a decorator must be used;</li>
<li>learn to identify the functionality that should be extracted into a decorator;</li>
<li>use an analogy to understand what a decorator is;</li>
<li>implement two simple decorators as initial examples;</li>
<li>learn the full anatomy of a general decorator;</li>
<li>understand why <code>functools.wraps</code> should be used when defining decorators;</li>
<li>add arguments to your decorators to make them more useful;</li>
<li>handle the multiple usage patterns that decorators need to handle, inspired by the way the standard library does it;</li>
<li>see that, sometimes, classes can also be used as decorators; and</li>
<li>learn that classes can also be decorated.</li>

<h2 id="a-function-that-did-too-much">A function that did too much<a class="toc-anchor after" href="#a-function-that-did-too-much"></a></h2>
<p>The decorator pattern is a pattern that lets you complement a function with behaviour that is useful but that is orthogonal to the original objective of the function.
This pattern is relevant because you do not want to <a href="/blog/pydonts/functions-a-complete-reference#what-goes-into-a-function-and-what-doesnt">overcrowd your functions</a>, and at the same time it allows you to define this useful behaviour in a way that is reusable by other functions.</p>
<p>As an example, consider how you might have implemented the mathematical operation factorial before it was introduced in the module <code>math</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py"># In modern Python: from math import factorial
def factorial(n):
    r = 1
    while n &gt; 1:
        r *= n
        n -= 1
    return r</code></pre>
<p>If you are calling this function a lot with a few large integers as arguments, you may want to cache the results you compute.
For this effect, you may want to use a dictionary that maps inputs to outputs:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">_factorial_cache = {}

def factorial(n):
    if n not in _factorial_cache:
        _n = n
        r = 1
        while _n &gt; 1:
            r *= _n
            _n -= 1
        _factorial_cache[n] = r

    return _factorial_cache[n]</code></pre>
<p>This solution is far from ideal, since you introduced a function cache that is only loosely coupled to the function it's relevant for, while also introducing code in the function that is not really relevant for the original objective of the function.</p>
<p>Instead of baking caching into the function, which is a poor one-time solution for something I might want to do with several functions, I can write a higher-order function that adds caching to any function I want.
Let me walk you through this transformation.</p>

            In Python, a tuple is a built-in data type that allows you to create immutable sequences of values. The values or items in a tuple can be of any type. This makes tuples pretty useful in those situations where you need to store heterogeneous data, like that in a database record, for example.

<p>Even if most of new APIs today are built around REST, there are still already existing,
production applications and systems that expose their APIs using SOAP and WSDL only -
in today's article we are integrating with a SOAP service in order to expose it as a REST
interface to external applications.</p>
<h2 id="wsdl">WSDL</h2>
<p>WSDL is the language which describes how to invoke SOAP-based applications, using what input,
under what address and what output to expect. In the article,
we are using <a href="http://webservices.oorsprong.org/websamples.countryinfo/CountryInfoService.wso">a public endpoint</a>
whose WSDL you can <a href="http://webservices.oorsprong.org/websamples.countryinfo/CountryInfoService.wso?WSDL">download here</a>.</p>
<p>Once downloaded, import the WSDL into a tool such as Enterprise Architect or Eclipse to browse its contents.
You can also import it to SoapUI to invoke the same service that we are going to access from Zato and Python
later on.</p>
<p><img src="https://upcdn.io/kW15bqq/raw/root/static/blog/images/3.2-soap-wsdl/request.png" /></p>
<p><img src="https://upcdn.io/kW15bqq/raw/root/static/blog/images/3.2-soap-wsdl/response.png" /></p>
<h2 id="zato-dashboard">Zato Dashboard</h2>
<p>The first step is to create a new outgoing SOAP connection in Zato web-admin - simply fill out the form, pointing it to the location
of the WSDL resource that contains the description of the remote endpoint.</p>
<p><img src="https://upcdn.io/kW15bqq/raw/root/static/blog/images/3.2-soap-wsdl/soap-menu.png" /></p>
<p><img src="https://upcdn.io/kW15bqq/raw/root/static/blog/images/3.2-soap-wsdl/soap-create.png" /></p>
<p>Once this is done, you will notice a series of entries in the Zato server log, confirming that a queue of connections
to the SOAP endpoint has been created successfully.</p>
<p><img src="https://upcdn.io/kW15bqq/raw/root/static/blog/images/3.2-soap-wsdl/soap-log.png" /></p>
<h2 id="python-code">Python code</h2>
<p>We can now author the code needed for the transformation of SOAP into JSON - for simplicity,
we are invoking only one specific SOAP service here (LanguageISOCode) but in a full integration project,
it would be easy to automate the whole process and have a single transformation service,
translating JSON calls into SOAP and the other way around.</p>

<h2 id="api-channel">API channel</h2>
<p>After deploying the service above, we can create a REST API channel for it.</p>

<h2 id="invoking-the-rest-endpoint">Invoking the REST endpoint</h2>
<p>Now, it is possible to invoke the REST endpoint - let's use curl to do just that:</p>
<p><img src="https://upcdn.io/kW15bqq/raw/root/static/blog/images/3.2-soap-wsdl/result-cli.png" /></p>
<h2 id="wsdl-reloading">WSDL reloading</h2>
<p>We are almost done but there is still one point to keep in mind - when a WSDL changes,
e.g. when a SOAP endpoint's service modifies its input or output, you need to reload the WSDL
in Zato so as to load in the newest updates.</p>
<p>You can do it in web-admin too - go to Connections -&gt; SOAP and click Reload WSDL, as below:</p>
<p><img src="https://upcdn.io/kW15bqq/raw/root/static/blog/images/3.2-soap-wsdl/soap-reload.png" /></p>
<p>Now we are really through although we could very well go further. For instance, we can add
multiple REST channels, handle multiple SOAP backend endpoints or turn WSDL-based services
into OpenAPI-based ones. These are all valid subjects but they are left for future articles.</p>

            The Open Source Initiative (OST) is the authority that defines Open Source. They’ve published my guide to security for Python web applications as a three part series. *“The Absolute Minimum Every Python Web Application Developer Must Know About Security”. Never store passwords in plain text. At a minimum you should be storing salted hashed passwords (which is probably what went wrong in the image here), even better use a key derivation function, but best of all delegate password management to a modern framework and keep it up to date. And never implement your own cryptography algorithms. Data should be encrypted in transit and at rest. Just stealing your database shouldn’t reveal sensitive information because data is encrypted at rest. You can do this with the StringEncryptedType for SQLAlchemy for example. mTLS (Mutual TLS) is how we can keep data encrypted in transit, even on our internal networks. Just getting access to your network shouldn’t reveal any sensitive information because data is encrypted in transit. These are just a few of the principles from a Defence in Depth, multi-layered, approach to security explored in this article series: Essential Python Web Security The Defence in Depth approach, important security principles, The OWASP Top Ten, the CVE warning system, authentication controls and security tooling. Security and cryptography algorithms: A guide Cryptography algorithms, using the cryptography library and the Python standard library. Hashing, encryption, key exchange protocols and public/private key signature algorithms with their use cases. TLS and Networking Much of our security is network security and much of that comes from TLS. We now understand all the crypto algorithms that make up TLS as a security system and can understand when, how and why to use TLS. We’ll also look at the request-&gt;response cycle of HTTP, the abstraction layer developers work at, and the security issues around networking. From firewalls to cookies via LANs and sockets. (Being able to talk about the Blowfish Cipher and the Diffie-Hellmann Elliptic Curve Key Exchange Protocol is cyberpunk, so these articles are teaching real life skills.) Thanks to Dr David Cassandra Mertz and PyDanny (Daniel Greenfeld) for improving these articles through technical review and to Nick Vidal (and volunteers) from the OSI for their work editing and formatting the articles.

          </h2>

        <!-- Content Section -->
        <div class="p-4 flex-grow overflow-hidden">
          <p class="text-base-content">
            <p>I have <a href="https://rickardlindberg.me/2017/05/19/evolution-of-recalling.html">previously
written</a>
about how I use <a href="https://rickardlindberg.me/projects/rlselect/">rlselect</a> as a
replacement for Ctrl+R in Bash.</p>
<p>It works by creating a key binding in Bash for Ctrl+R that invokes <code>rlselect</code>
instead of the default Bash interactive history search command. <code>rlselect</code>
looks something like this:</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of rlselect showing two entries, hello
and world, with hello selected." height="373" src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/173380/2025/rlselect-selecting-hello.png" width="600" /></p>
<p>If you press tab, the current selection is inserted at the prompt. If you press
enter, the current selection is executed. This is the same behavior as the
default Ctrl+R.</p>
<p>The mechanism for this stopped working in recent Linux kernel versions. I
figured out how to solve it and in this blog post I explain how.</p>
<h2 id="old-mechanism">Old Mechanism</h2>
<p>When <code>rlselect</code> is invoked from Ctrl+R, it is invoked with the <code>--tab</code> and
<code>--action</code> flags. The first flag allows the tab key to be used to select a line
and the second makes <code>rlselect</code> print the action taken on the first line
before to the selection.</p>
<p>Here is an example where enter is pressed when &ldquo;hello&rdquo; is selected:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-text">$ (echo hello; echo world) | rlselect --tab --action
enter
hello
</code></pre></div><p>Here is an example where tab is pressed when &ldquo;world&rdquo; is selected:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-text">$ (echo hello; echo world) | rlselect --tab --action
tab
world
</code></pre></div><p>Here is an example where Ctrl+G is pressed:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-text">$ (echo hello; echo world) | rlselect --tab --action
ctrl-g
</code></pre></div><p>Ctrl+G aborts, so no selection is printed on the second line.</p>
<p>To feed this output to the prompt, TIOCSTI is used. It simulates that you type
characters in the terminal. The full script that Ctrl+R invokes looks like
this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash">set -e

result<span style="color: #f92672;">=</span><span style="color: #66d9ef;">$(</span>tac ~/.bash_history | rlselect --tab --action -- <span style="color: #e6db74;">"</span>$@<span style="color: #e6db74;">"</span><span style="color: #66d9ef;">)</span>

python - <span style="color: #e6db74;">"</span>$result<span style="color: #e6db74;">"</span> <span style="color: #e6db74;">&lt;&lt; EOF
</span><span style="color: #e6db74;">import fcntl
</span><span style="color: #e6db74;">import sys
</span><span style="color: #e6db74;">import termios
</span><span style="color: #e6db74;">
</span><span style="color: #e6db74;">action, selection = sys.argv[1].split("\n", 1)
</span><span style="color: #e6db74;">
</span><span style="color: #e6db74;">if action != "tab":
</span><span style="color: #e6db74;">    selection += "\n"
</span><span style="color: #e6db74;">
</span><span style="color: #e6db74;">for ch in selection:
</span><span style="color: #e6db74;">    fcntl.ioctl(sys.stdout.fileno(), termios.TIOCSTI, ch)
</span><span style="color: #e6db74;">EOF</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The last part is where TIOCSTI is used to simulate that you press the keys
of the selection. Unless tab is pressed, it appends a newline to the
selection to simulate that Enter is pressed.</p>
<p>The Bash configuration looks like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span style="color: #66d9ef;">if</span> <span style="color: #f92672;">[[</span> $- <span style="color: #f92672;">=</span>~ .*i.* <span style="color: #f92672;">]]</span>; <span style="color: #66d9ef;">then</span> bind <span style="color: #e6db74;">'"\C-r": "\C-a rlselect-history \C-j"'</span>; <span style="color: #66d9ef;">fi</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Here is how it works:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ctrl+R is bound to a series of keystrokes.</li>
<li>First Ctrl+A is simulated which takes the cursor to the beginning of the
line.</li>
<li>Then <code>&lt;space&gt;rlselect-history&lt;space&gt;</code> is typed.</li>
<li>Then Ctrl+J is simulated which means accept the current line. Or execute it.
The initial space entered in the previous step ensures that the
<code>rlselect-history</code> command does not end up in the history. The moving of the
cursor to the beginning of the line ensures that anything typed at the prompt
is passed as an argument to <code>rlselect-history</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>(This configuration also makes the text <code> rlselect-history ...</code> appear in the
terminal. The new mechanism makes that go away.)</p>
<p>This mechanism stopped working in recent Linux kernel versions because TIOCSTI
can not be used like this. There is apparently security issues with TIOCSTI and
it is now only allowed as root.</p>
<h2 id="new-mechanism">New Mechanism</h2>
<p>The new Bash configuration for Ctrl+R behavior that I came up with looks like
this:</p>

</code></pre></div><p>Let&rsquo;s break this down.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Ctrl+R is bound to a series of keystrokes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>First Ctrl+X+1 is simulated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then Ctrl+X+2 is simulated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ctrl+X+1 is bound to execute the command <code>rlselect-history</code>. The <code>-x</code> to bind
ensures that the variables <code>READLINE_*</code> can be set. From <code>man bash</code> on <code>set
 -x</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cause shell-command to  be executed  whenever keyseq is entered. When
shell-command is executed, the shell sets the READLINE_LINE variable to the
contents of the readline line buffer and the READLINE_POINT and
READLINE_MARK variables [&hellip;] If the executed command changes the value of
any of READLINE_LINE, READLINE_POINT, or READLINE_MARK, those new values
will be reflected in the editing state.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>rlselect-history</code> is defined as a Bash function which allows it to
reconfigure the key binding for Ctrl+X+2. Depending on if the current
selection should be executed or not, it binds Ctrl+X+2 to either
<code>accept-line</code> or nothing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So the new mechanism relies on using two extra key bindings: Ctrl+X+1 and
Ctrl+X+2. I chose them because I don&rsquo;t use them otherwise. But they can be any
two key bindings.</p>
<p>The trick to finding this solution for me was understanding Bash key bindings.
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/13978131">This answer</a> on StackOverflow writes the
following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With <code>bind</code>, you can bind keys to do one of three things, but no combination
of them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Execute a readline command: <code>bind '&quot;key&quot;: command'</code></li>
<li>Execute a series of keystrokes: <code>bind '&quot;key&quot;:&quot;keystrokes&quot;'</code></li>
<li>Execute a shell command: <code>bind -x '&quot;key&quot;: shell-command'</code></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>That made me understand that you can not call <code>accept-line</code> from within
<code>rlselect-history</code> because it is executed in the context of <code>bind -x</code>, and
readline commands can only be executed in the context of <code>bind '&quot;key&quot;:
 command'</code>.</p>
<h2 id="resources">Resources</h2>
<p>Here are some resources that talks about the problem with TIOCSTI that helped
me:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/dvorka/hstr">hstr</a> (the program that initially inspired
me to write <code>rlselect</code>) had a <a href="https://github.com/dvorka/hstr/issues/478">similar
problem</a> and I found clues to my
solution there.</p>

            <p>When I developed <a class="reference external" href="https://werkzeug.palletsprojects.com/">Werkzeug</a> (and
later <a class="reference external" href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/">Flask</a>), the most
important part of the developer experience for me was enabling fast, automatic
reloading.  Werkzeug (and with it Flask), this is achieved by using two
procsses at all times.  The parent process holds on to the file descriptor
of the socket on which the server listens, and a subprocess picks up that
file descriptor.  That subprocess restarts when it detects changes.  This
ensures that no matter what happens, there is no window where the browser
reports a connection error.  At worst, the browser will hang until the
process finishes reloading, after which the page loads successfully.  In
case the inner process fails to come up during restarts, you get an error
message.</p>
<p>A few years ago, I wanted to accomplish the same experience for working
with Rust code which is why I wrote <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mitsuhiko/systemfd">systemfd</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mitsuhiko/listenfd">listenfd</a>.  I however realized that I
never really wrote here about how they work and disappointingly I think
those crates, and a good auto-reloading experience in Rust are largely
unknown.</p>
<div class="section" id="watching-for-changes">
<h2>Watching for Changes</h2>
<p>Firstly one needs to monitor the file system for changes.  While in theory
I could have done this myself, there was already a tool that could do
that.</p>
<p>At the time there was <a class="reference external" href="https://crates.io/crates/cargo-watch">cargo watch</a>.  Today one might instead use it
together with the more generic <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/watchexec/watchexec">watchexec</a>.  Either one monitor your
workspace for changes and then executes a command.  So you can for
instance tell it to restart your program.  One of these will work:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
watchexec -r -- cargo run
cargo watch -x run
</pre>
<p>You will need a tool like that to do the watching part.  At this point I
recommend the more generic <cite>watchexec</cite> which you can find on <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/watchexec/watchexec/blob/main/doc/packages.md">homebrew and
elsewhere</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="passing-sockets">
<h2>Passing Sockets</h2>
<p>But what about the socket?  The solution to this problem I picked comes
from <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd">systemd</a>.  Systemd has a
“protocol” that standardizes passing file descriptors from one process to
another through environment variables.  In systemd parlance this is called
“socket activation,” as it allows systemd to only launch a program if
someone started making a request to the socket.  This concept was
originally introduced by Apple as part of launchd.</p>
<p>To make this work with Rust, I created two crates:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mitsuhiko/systemfd">systemfd</a> is the command
line tool that opens sockets and passes them on to other programs.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://crates.io/crates/listenfd">listenfd</a> is a Rust crate that
accepts file descriptors from systemd or <cite>systemfd</cite>.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's worth noting that systemfd is not exclusivly useful to Rust.  The
systemd protocol can be implemented in other languages as well, meaning
that if you have a socket server written in Go or Python, you can also use
systemfd.</p>
<p>So here is how you use it.</p>
<p>First you need to add <cite>listenfd</cite> to your project:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
cargo add listenfd
</pre>
<p>Then, modify your server code to accept sockets via listenfd before
falling back to listening itself on ports provided through command-line
arguments or configuration files.  Here is an example using <cite>listenfd</cite> in
axum:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">use</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">axum</span>::<span class="p">{</span><span class="n">routing</span>::<span class="n">get</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">Router</span><span class="p">};</span><span class="w"></span>

<p>The key point here is to accept socket 0 from the environment as a TCP
listener and use it if available.  If the socket is not provided (e.g.
when launched without systemd/<cite>systemfd</cite>), the code falls back to opening a
fixed port.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="putting-it-together">
<h2>Putting it Together</h2>
<p>Finally you can use <cite>cargo watch</cite> / <cite>watchexec</cite> together with <cite>systemfd</cite>:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
systemfd --no-pid -s http::8888 -- watchexec -r -- cargo run
systemfd --no-pid -s http::8888 -- cargo watch -x run
</pre>
<p>This is what the parameters mean:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal">systemfd</tt> needs to be first it's the program that opens the sockets.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--no-pid</span></tt> is a flag prevents the PID from being passed.  This is necessary
for <cite>listenfd</cite> to accept the socket.  This is a departure of the socket
passing protocol from systemd which otherwise does not allow ports to be
passed through another program (like <cite>watchexec</cite>).  In short: when the
PID information is not passed, then listenfd will accept the socket
regardless.  Otherwise it would only accept it from the direct parent
process.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-s</span> <span class="pre">http::8888</span></tt> tells <cite>systemfd</cite> to open one TCP socket on port 8888.
Using <cite>http</cite> instead of <cite>tcp</cite> is a small improvement that will cause
systemfd to print out a URL on startup.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--</span> watchexec <span class="pre">-r</span></tt> makes <cite>watchexec</cite> restart the process when something
changes in the current working directory.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--</span> cargo run</tt> is the program that watchexec will start and re-start onm
changes.  In Rust this will first compile the changes and then run the
application.  Because we put <cite>listenfd</cite> in, it will try to first accept
the socket from <cite>systemfd</cite>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The end result is that you can edit your code, and it will recompile
automatically and restart the server without dropping any requests.  When
you run it, and perform changes, it will look a bit like this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ systemfd --no-pid -s http::5555 -- watchexec -r -- cargo run
~&gt; socket http://127.0.0.1:5555/ -&gt; fd #3
[Running: cargo run]
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.02s
     Running `target/debug/axum-test`
[Running: cargo run]
   Compiling axum-test v0.1.0 (/private/tmp/axum-test)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.52s
     Running `target/debug/axum-test`
</pre>
<p>For easier access, I recommend putting this into a <cite>Makefile</cite> or similar
so you can just run <cite>make devserver</cite> and it runs the server in watch mode.</p>
<p>To install <cite>systemfd</cite> you can use curl to bash:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
curl -sSfL https://github.com/mitsuhiko/systemfd/releases/latest/download/systemfd-installer.sh | sh
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-about-windows">
<h2>What About Windows?</h2>
<p>Now how does this work on Windows?  The answer is that <cite>systemfd</cite> and
<cite>listenfd</cite> have a custom, proprietary protocol that also makes socket
passing work on Windows.  That's a more complex system which involves a
local RPC server.  However the system does also support Windows and the
details about how it works are largely irrelevant for you as a user
—&nbsp;unless you want to implement that protocol for another programming
language.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="potential-improvements">
<h2>Potential Improvements</h2>
<p>I really enjoy using this combination, but it can be quite frustrating to
require so many commands, and the command line workflow isn't optimal.
Ideally, this functionality would be better integrated into specific Rust
frameworks like axum and provided through a dedicated cargo plugin.  In a
perfect world, one could simply run <cite>cargo devserver</cite>, and everything
would work seamlessly.</p>
<p>However, maintaining such an integrated experience is a much more involved
effort than what I have.  Hopefully, someone will be inspired to further
enhance the developer experience and achieve deeper integration with Rust
frameworks, making it more accessible and convenient for everyone.</p>

          <p class="text-base-content">
            <p>&nbsp;</p><p>I just stumbled upon a code in Python that uses a simple `<b>Path(...).resolve()</b>`
 after receiving a path in an API and suddenly reminded myself on the 
many the bugs I've tripped over due to it, so, decided to share&nbsp; why I 
hope at some point this function stops being so pervasive as it's 
usually the wrong thing to call.. (maybe because when <b>Python </b>went from <b>os.path</b> to <b>pathlib </b>they added no real replacement and now you need to use both).</p><p>The main reason of bugs for that is that when you call <b>Path.resolve()</b> it'll actually resolve <b>symlinks </b>(and <b>substs on Windows</b>).<br /></p><p></p><p>This means that if the user crafted some structure as</p><p></p><blockquote><p>/myproject</p><p>/myproject/package.json</p><p>/myproject/src -&gt; symlink to sources in /allmysources/temp</p></blockquote><p></p><p>&nbsp;If you resolve `<b>/myproject/src/myfile.py</b>` to `<b>/allmysources/temp/myfile.py</b>` and actually want to get to the `<b>package.json</b>`, it'll never be found!</p><p>&nbsp;I was even looking at the python docs and found this nugget when talking about `<b>Path.parent</b>`:</p><p></p><p></p><blockquote><p>If you want to walk an arbitrary filesystem path upwards, it is
recommended to first call <a class="reference internal" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path.resolve" title="pathlib.Path.resolve"><code class="xref py py-meth docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Path.resolve()</span></code></a> so as to resolve
symlinks and eliminate <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">".."</span></code> components.</p></blockquote><p></p><p></p><p>And that's completely <b>why you shouldn't use it</b> because if you do, then the parents will be completely off!</p><p>So, what should you do?</p><p>Unfortunately <b>pathlib </b>is not your friend here, you need to use `<b>os.path.normpath(os.path.abspath(...))</b>` to remove `<b>..</b>` occurrences from the string and make it absolute (and then after, sure, use <b>pathlib </b>for
 the remainder of your program) -- possibly you even want to get the 
real case in the filesystem if you're on Windows (which is very annoying
 as then you end up needing to do a bunch of <b>listdir()</b> calls to get the case stored in the filesystem).</p><p>&nbsp;--
 but also, keep in mind you usually just need to do that on boundaries 
(i.e.: when you receive a relative path as an argument in the command 
line for instance, not when you receive an API call from another program
 -- chances are, the <b>cwd </b>of that program and your own are different and thus <b>calls to `absolute()` or `resolve()` are actually bugs</b>).</p><p></p><p>But isn't there any use-case for `<b>Path.resolve()</b>`?</p><p>As
 far as I know, the only case where it's valid is if you do want to 
create a cache of sorts where any representation of that file is 
considered the same (i.e.: you really want the canonical representation 
of the file).&nbsp;</p><p>Say, in an IDE you opened your `<b>subst</b>` in `<b>x:</b>` and then you have `<b>c:\project\foo.py</b>` and `<b>x:\foo.py</b>`
 in a debugger and you want to always show the version that's opened 
under your IDE, you need to build that mapping so that regardless of the
 version that's accessed you will open the version that's being seen in 
your IDE (and oh my god, I've seen so many IDEs get that wrong and the 
effect is usually you'll have the same file opened under different names
 in the IDE -- I know that in the <b>pydevd debugger</b> this is especially tricky because the name of the file is gotten from a <b>.pyc</b>
 file, which depends on how it was generated and the cached version may 
not match the version that the user is currently seeing -- the&nbsp; debugger
 goes through great lengths to have an internal canonical representation
 and a different version which should be what the user sees, but it's 
not perfect and IDEs which actually open the file afterwards don't make 
the due diligence to try to do the proper mapping afterwards -- even 
worse when they fail because the path is the same but the drive is 
uppercase and internally the path they have has the drive in lowercase).</p><p>Maybe even then it'd be better to use the inode of the file for a reference (gotten from `<b>Path.stat()</b>`)...</p><p>Anyways, to sum up, in its current format, I'd just recommend to <b>ALMOST NEVER </b>use `<b>resolve()</b>` as it's usually just the source of bugs, keep to <b>`Path(os.path.normpath(os.path.abspath(...)))` </b>on
 program boundaries as that's just saner in general (and when you want 
to pass files among APIs, make sure paths are already absolute and 
normalized and fail if they aren't).<b><br /></b></p><p>p.s.: just as a 
disclaimer, I've also seen a very minor subset of users on Linux (just 
one so far really, but maybe there are others that want that behavior 
out there) that say they want the symlinks resolved as the created 
structure they have is always final and the symlinks are just a 
commodity to avoid having to cd into that structure so that they can 
freely cd into symlinks (and as such they don't want to affect the 
structure when they created symlinks), but I don't think this is the 
most common behavior (and if it is, then programs probably need to have a
 flag determining on whether to use it or not (for instance, I know vite
 from javascript has a <span class="kY2IgmnCmOGjharHErah"><span><b>resolve.preserveSymlinks </b>setting
 so that the user can decide if they want it or not) -- although it's 
also true that most users don't even care, because they don't put their 
source code in a symlink or Windows subst 😊<br /></span></span></p>

            <p>&nbsp;It's frustrating when useful tools refuse to work together nicely. In the past I've experienced conflicts between <span style="font-family: courier;">black</span> and <span style="font-family: courier;">flake8</span> that made it impossible to commit via my default commit hooks. Now I'm seeing the same behaviour with <span style="font-family: courier;">black</span> and <span style="font-family: courier;">reorder-python-imports</span>.</p><p>In short, almost a year ago now github user <b>maxwell-k</b>&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/psf/black/issues/4175" target="_blank">reported</a> that <span style="font-family: courier;">black</span> release 24.1.0 had introduced an incompatibility with&nbsp;<span style="font-family: courier;">reorder-python-imports</span>&nbsp;by starting to require a blank line after a module docstring. In the discussion on the bug report the <span style="font-family: courier;">black</span> crew make the reasonable-seeming point that it's <span style="font-family: courier;">black</span>'s job to determine the disposition of whitespace, and that <span style="font-family: courier;">reorder-python-imports</span> should do what its name implies and nothing more. This would respect the long-standing Unix tradition that each tool should as far as possible perform a single function.</p><p>Unfortunately, when <b>elagil</b>&nbsp;raised the same issue with the&nbsp;<span style="font-family: courier;">reorder-python-imports</span>&nbsp;developers, with a request to make their project usable with black (ably supported by <b>maxwell-k</b>), they received a <a href="https://github.com/asottile/reorder-python-imports/issues/366#issuecomment-1912219570">response</a> which I can only (avoiding the use of expletives) describe as disappointing:</p><blockquote><p><span style="background-color: white; color: #1f2328; font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: courier;">anything is possible. will it happen here: no</span></span></p></blockquote><p>In my opinion this uncompromising attitude displays the worst kind of arrogance from a developer, and I frankly fail to see who benefits from this refusal to bend (except perhaps a developer unwilling to work further on a project or set it free). The net consequence from my own point of view is that I'll no longer be using reorder-python-imports, nor recommending it.</p><p>The situation remains unchanged. Life's too short to persuade donkeys to move. On the plus side, research into solving this irritation led me to start working with <span style="font-family: courier;">ruff</span>, which provides the functionality of both utilities in a single rather faster tool. It's an ill wind that blows nobody any good. Goodbye, donkeys!</p>
